Systems Simulation discipline. Students are responsible for developing a Digital Twin of
a  PLC  throughout  the  course.  It  was  observed  that  including  the  theme  can  generate
increased  motivation,  as  well  as  accountability  for  the  student's  own  learning.  Within
Robotics  University's  education,  Digital  Twins  are  being  used  to  virtualize  Training
Centers for trainees and students. Due to the challenges of having a sufficient, in size and
in adaptability laboratory to handle the capacity of training  and researching for students
and  industrial  partners,  the  use  of  Digital  Twins  to  digitalize  a  Robotic  Industrial  Arm
laboratory was performed by Erdei et al. (2022). The aim  of the study was to measure
the gap from using a real laboratory against digital ones. The study was performed with
students from different disciplines and at different levels of knowledge regarding robotic
and  automation  technology  in  the  University  of  Debrecen  Faculty  of  Engineering  as
shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3.   Comparison between Virtual (DT) and Physical form for students training
on an Industrial Robotic Arm system – source: [Erdei et al., 2022]
  To  test  the  effectiveness  of  the  Virtual  training with  DT,  students  were  divided
into two groups, one of them having the opportunity to use the Digital Twin created and
the other only using paperwork. After performing the tasks shown in Fig. 3, students that
had the opportunity to study using the DT, were more prepared and more knowledgeable,
in  contrast  to  the  ones  only  using  paperwork  and  documents  who  had  much  more
difficulty performing the tasks [Erdei et al., 2022].
3.2 Digital Twins in Health Education
The use of DT in Health Education appears to still be somewhat incipient, as
demonstrated by the works found. Drummond and Gonsard (2024) conducted a scoping
review that analyzed definitions and characteristics of patient Digital Twins for clinical
use. They identified 86 articles, nearly all in preclinical phases. In this context, a Digital
Twin was defined as "a visualizable digital replica of a patient, organ, or biological system
containing specific multidimensional patient information." The authors classified Digital
Twins  into  two  types:  simulation  and  monitoring,  with  applications  ranging  from
personalized predictions to optimizing continuous care. Johnson et al. (2023) envision the
use of DT in Health Education. In this context, the authors point out that Health Digital
Twins (HDTs) can revolutionize personalized medical treatments by combining research
knowledge  with  the  unique  patient  history  and  physiology.  Initial  examples  include

simulations  of  the  heart  and  brain,  but  the  field's  evolution  should  encompass  cellular
models, microbiota, and patient slices on multidisciplinary platforms. Thus, they predict
that  HDTs  will  cover  all  medical  disciplines  and  the  entire  patient  journey,  improving
medical practices, precision medicine, and surgery, as well as increasing patient
autonomy for better overall health. In the work of Attaran and Celik (2023), the authors
mention that Virtual Reality (VR) technology has had the potential for decades to be used
in medical training, complementing and enhancing traditional health education. Thus, AI-
enabled DTs, using the power of Virtual and Augmented Reality, can facilitate training
and education for healthcare professionals. For example, three-dimensional models can
be used for the study of medical anatomy and surgical procedures to promote interactive
learning and minimize the use of cadavers. In this way, Medical Schools can use Digital
Twin solutions to teach surgical techniques using simulation.
  According to Iqbal, Krauthammer, and Biller-Andorno (2022), DTs can assist in
various medical functions and in all stages of the disease lifecycle: pre-disease
management,  disease  management,  and  post-disease  management.  Thus,  the  authors
point out the use of Digital Twins in the contexts of screening and prevention, diagnosis,
prognosis, treatment and relief, prediction of intervention effects, and disease monitoring.
However,  the  authors  point  out  several  ethical  challenges  with  the  use  of  DT  in  the
Medical area, namely:
• Equity in Access to Technology: The shortage of medical and IT professionals
can increase competition, benefiting wealthy countries and widening inequalities.
Reimbursement policies can accentuate differences in health outcomes based on
ability to pay;
• Complexity, Legal Responsibility, and Ownership: Allocating responsibility is
still  an  open  issue,  as  the  complexity  of  Digital  Twins  can  make  it  difficult  to
clearly define responsibilities. Responsibility may lie with companies developing
Digital Twins, questioning who owns the specific patient model and how to ensure
the safety and effectiveness of these models;
• Autonomy  and  Nonmaleficence:  DTs  can  create  a  false  sense  of  security  and
excessive  dependence,  threatening  the  autonomy  of  patients  and  healthcare
professionals, as medical decisions may be influenced by DT recommendations;
• Privacy: Maximum Potential for Data and DT Model Abuse: Integrating multiple
data sources and analyzing medical functions have significant financial value for
legitimate and illegitimate stakeholders. The risk of hackers and abuse of sensitive
data is significant, making the protection of Digital Twins critical and questioning
potential benefits versus risks.
3.3 Digital Twins in AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) Teaching
A common finding in the papers reviewed is that the concept of Digital Twin is still in
the prototype phase in the AEC sector compared to other industries, as real applications
are rare [Pregnolato et al., 2022]. Much of this is due to the lack of protocols and standards
that  would  serve  as  a  guide.  To  address  this  issue,  academia  and  industry  have  been
working  to  define  processes  for  developing  a  Digital  Twin,  especially  for  legacy
infrastructures,  which  are  less  likely  to  have  support  for  the  necessary  technologies  to
adapt to a DT implementation [Pregnolato et al., 2022]. In the UK, major AEC consulting
firms  (e.g.,  Arup,  Mott  MacDonald)  have  been  working  with  the  CDBB  (Center  for
Digital Built Britain) and universities (e.g., Cambridge University's Institute for

Manufacturing)  to  align  their  agendas  with  the  future  vision  for  Digital  Twins.  Some
metrics  have  already  been  defined  in  the  report  by  Arup  (2019),  such  as  autonomy,
intelligence, learning, and fidelity. Each of these is evaluated on a scale of 1 to 5 regarding
the maturity level of the Digital Twin implementation. In addition to the aforementioned
aspects, the multidisciplinarity, dynamism, and high complexity present in infrastructure
and construction projects have attracted even more the construction industry's attention
towards  implementing  Digital  Twins  in  their  projects  [Dai  and  Brell-Çokcan,  2022]  as
shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4.  Core functions of a DT based Multiplayer game used in construction
teaching.  – source: [Dai and Brell-Çokan, 2022]
  Although  still  in  its  infancy  in  this  field,  the  concept  of  Digital  Twin  and  the
surrounding technologies are gaining more space  in university education,  Calveti et al.
(2024)  discusses  the  current  need  for  civil  engineers  to  master  concepts  related  to
technology and IT infrastructure and project management. As an example in Kangisser et
al. (2022), the concept of Digital Twins helps university students in Civil Engineering,
Civil  Construction,  and  Architecture  courses  at  the  Georgia  Institute  of  Technology
understand what is known as Construction 4.0. This is defined by Smit, J. et al. (2016) as
the organization of production processes based on technology and devices that
communicate  autonomously.  Following  this  line,  Calveti  et  al.  (2024),  talks  about  the
importance of updating curricula in Civil Engineering courses, and how integrating the
concept of Digital Twins into the curriculum can help students in course engagement, self
development and readiness for the Construction 4.0 market, keeping up with the industry's
technological  revolutions.  In  fact,  the  work  of  Dai  and  Brell-Çokcan  (2022),  saw  an
increase in motivation and learning interest of the students through the usage of the Unreal
game engine to develop a DT of a construction site in Aachen West, which is a campus-
based living lab.
3.4 Digital Twins - R&D and Technical Training in Automotive, Robotics, and
Energy Industries
 The concept of Digital Twins is already well known in the automotive sector, where major
manufacturers  use  them  as  a  faithful  virtual  representation  of  the  vehicle's  mechanical
and aerodynamic parts. However, with the advancement of autonomous driving
technologies,  Digital  Twins  have  assumed  an  even  more  important  role  for  the  sector,
specifically in R&D for vehicle communication and autonomous vehicle training [Samak

et  al.,  2023].  This  further  encourages  the  inclusion  of  Digital  Twins  in  the  training  of
professionals working in this area. In the energy industry, specifically in the area of Smart
Grids (SGs), due to the high cost related to  developing test-beds capable  of supporting
real attacks and adapting to different scenarios and applications, creating a Digital Twin
is  of  utmost  importance  to  facilitate  training  for  various  types  of  cyber  attacks  and
conducting  research  [Kandasamy  et  al.,  2020].  In  his  work  [Kandasamy  et  al.,  2020]
developed a Digital Twin of an Industrial Control System plant, on the size of a micro
grid,  despite  the  differences  between  the  Digital  Twin  and  the  physical  test-bed  due  to
constraints, the project made it possible for students, researchers and training operators
to  perform  their  assessment  on  threats  of  attacks  into  the  components  of  the  grid,
vulnerabilities of the system as well as performing rapid deployments and prototyping.
  Figure 5 shows an example of DT for workforce training in a Brazilian electrical
company,  showing  an  avatar  of  a  worker  manipulating  high-risk  electrical  equipment,
having access to real-time information about the asset.

4. Research Challenges
As  a  nascent  technology  in  Education,  DTs  face  barriers  to  effective  implementation,
particularly in developing or underdeveloped countries. Key challenges include:
● Technical  Complexity:  Implementing  and  maintaining  Digital  Twins  requires
advanced technological infrastructure, which involves:
○ Developing  realistic  3D  models  to  represent  complex  components  and
objects, or mathematical models for processes and systems;
○ High-speed, secure networks capable of synchronizing Digital Twins with
their real counterparts and transmitting large data volumes in real time;
○ Storing vast amounts of data and their models;
○ Real-time parallel and distributed processing capabilities;
○ Sensing and actuating elements in real-world components;
○ Skilled teams to implement, manage, and update all system components.

● Initial Cost: The development of Digital Twins often requires significant initial
investment due to the aforementioned technical complexity. Additionally,
ongoing maintenance costs are substantial;
● Security  and  Privacy:  Robust  cybersecurity  measures  are  essential  to  comply
with data protection laws in each country, given the extensive data collection and
analysis involved in Digital Twins;
● Integration with Existing Systems: Integrating new systems with existing ones
is generally complex. In the educational context, this complexity is heightened by
the need for a paradigm shift. Integration considerations must encompass
administrative systems, existing Virtual Learning Environments, and the
limitations and possibilities of integrating with Digital Twins;
● Digital Divide: Inequities in technology access can limit the reach of Digital Twin
solutions, particularly in developing or underdeveloped countries, or regions and
communities with high social vulnerability, which is a big issue in Latin American
countries [Souza et al., 2023];
● Accessibility:  Given  the  various  media  involved  in  Digital  Twin  solutions,  the
limitations of students with physical and cognitive disabilities must be considered.
Lessons learned in other educational contexts, regarding content creation [Eliseo
et al., 2023], could be helpful.
 Literature  review  suggests  pathways  to  mitigate  these  challenges.  Regarding  technical
complexity, research opportunities include:
● Automating  or  semi-automating  the  generation  of  3D  models  for  objects  and
environments  using  Artificial  Intelligence  techniques  such  as  Large  Language
Models (LLM), 3D  Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), photogrammetry,
and other image-based techniques, and advanced Computer Vision technique , or
a  combination  of  these  methods.  For  Digital  Twins  based  on  3D  models,  these
solutions minimize modeling effort, time, and cost [Luhmann et al., 2023; Song
et al., 2023; Hong, 2023; Hu et al., 2024];
● More  humanistic  conversational  agents  could  improve  the  usability  of  DT.
Research in Virtual Humans [Zalake et al., 2020] shows that users can experience
a  more  engaging,  efficient,  and  user-friendly  interface  that  leverages  the  full
potential of the technology;
● Enhancing  devices,  techniques,  and  architectures  for  storage,  connectivity,  and
processing is essential for effective Digital Twin implementation. Beyond Cloud
Computing, solutions like Edge Computing, Fog Computing, and Dew
Computing [Ageed et al., 2021] should be considered;
● For  sensors  and  actuators  in  the  IoT  context  integrated  with  Digital  Twins  in
Education,  further  research  is  needed.  Some  important  advances  in  this  aspect
have been reached in the field of Multimodal Learning Analytics [Ochoa  et al.,
2022];
● Regarding  the  digital  divide,  effective  public  policies  and  research  to  make
storage, network, and connectivity technologies more affordable and widespread
are crucial. But, more than the infrastructural elements, teacher training is a crucial
part of the process. For instance, OLPC (One Laptop Per Child)-related projects
[Maciel; Passerino & Bez, 2011; Fabris & Finco, 2012] were focused more on the
distribution of the laptops rather than on the accompanying teacher training and
support. This lack of emphasis on teacher preparation often resulted in

underutilization  of  the  laptops  and  missed  opportunities  to  enhance  learning
outcomes.  An  important  exception  has  been  Ceibal  in  Uruguay  [Pittaluga  &
Rivoir, 2012], which emphasizes teacher training and content generation, offering
reasonable directions for reducing the digital divide compared to merely providing
equipment. included comprehensive teacher training and ongoing support, which
contributed  to  its  relative  success.  Teachers  were  provided  with  professional
development to integrate the technology into their curriculum - the same
preoccupation must be carried out when adoption DT solutions in Education;
● For  accessibility,  despite  numerous  initiatives  related  to  assistive  technologies
and  educational  models  for  inclusion,  such  as  Universal  Design  for  Learning
(UDL) [Rose & Meyer, 2002], more research efforts are needed to enhance these
technologies and restructure models to support inclusion in complex interactions
with DTs.
5. Conclusions and Further Work
This  article  presents  a  literature  review  on  Digital  Twins  in  the  educational  field,
highlighting various application scenarios: Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and
Mathematics  (STEAM),  Healthcare Education,  Architecture and  Civil  Engineering
Education, Technical Training, and Management, Economy and Business. The focus of
this article also includes proposing and explaining a taxonomy that involves the inherent
concepts  of  DT,  as  well  as  an  overview  of  the  evolution  from  VR  to  DT  in  terms  of
technologies, methodologies, equipment, tools, and so on. Additionally, it discusses the
continuous  evolution  from  VR  to  DT  in  terms  of  technologies,  tools,  languages,  etc.,
which are intrinsically linked to the educational field.
  In higher education, we discussed the adoption of DT by universities in various
fields,  including  virtualizing  campus  environments,  improving  learning  processes,  and
reducing costs for equipment and laboratories. We also address gamification as another
approach  benefiting  from  DT  in  education,  using  gamification  elements  to  increase
motivation.  In  robotics  education,  DTs  virtualize  training  centers,  with  students  using
DTs demonstrating better preparedness and knowledge compared to traditional methods.
This  underscores  the  effectiveness  of  DTs  in  enhancing  educational  outcomes  across
various courses.
  The  use  of  DT  in  Health  Education  is  still  emerging,  with  key  applications
identified  in  simulation and  monitoring  of  patients,  organs,  or  biological  systems.  DTs
have  the  potential  to  revolutionize  personalized  medical  treatments  by  integrating
research knowledge with patient-specific data, extending to all medical courses.
Additionally, AI-enabled DTs using VR and AR enhance interactive learning in medical
training.
  In the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector,  the concept of
DT is still in the prototype phase, with few real  applications. This is largely due to the
lack of protocols and standards. Efforts are being made to define development processes,
particularly for legacy infrastructures.
  In the industry area, the concept of DT is widely used in the automotive sector for
representing vehicles' mechanical and aerodynamic parts. With advancements in
autonomous driving, DTs play a crucial role in vehicle communication and autonomous
vehicle training [Samak et al., 2023]. This has expanded DTs' use in professional training.

In  the  energy  industry,  particularly  Smart  Grids  (SGs),  DTs  are  vital  for  training  and
research due to the high cost of real test-beds. Kandasamy et al. (2020) developed a DT
of an Industrial Control System plant, enabling assessments of grid vulnerabilities, rapid
deployments, and prototyping.
  Further  research  is  required  to  fully  explore  the  potential  of  DT  in  various
domains, and in Education additional efforts must be made by researchers, educational
institutions, and companies, together with public policies focused on teacher training and
on  reduction  of  digital  gap,  so  that,  once  again,  this  field  does  not  fall  behind  in
technological innovations.
