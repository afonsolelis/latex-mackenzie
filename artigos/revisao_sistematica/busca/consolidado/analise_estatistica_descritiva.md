## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This comprehensive statistical analysis examines 179 carefully selected articles from a systematic review focused on technology-supported assessment in Project-Based Learning (PBL) environments. The analysis reveals significant insights about current research trends, technological applications, and critical gaps in the intersection of PBL, assessment technologies, and Digital Twins modeling.

### Key Findings:

**Research Activity:** Consistent publication activity from 2015-2025, with 54.2% of articles published in recent years (2020-2025), indicating sustained interest in technology-enhanced PBL assessment.

**Technology Focus:** Programming tools dominate the landscape (67.0% of articles), while critical emerging technologies like Digital Twins (0.6%), DevOps/CI-CD (0.6%), and automated assessment (0.6%) show significant research gaps.

**Methodological Approaches:** Assessment remains largely traditional, with 58.1% focused on general assessment methods. Advanced approaches like automated assessment (3.4%) and learning analytics (0.6%) are underexplored.

**Geographical Distribution:** Research is concentrated in international venues (36.0%) and USA (27.2%), with limited representation from developing regions, highlighting the need for more diverse, cross-cultural assessment approaches.

**Critical Research Gaps Identified:**
1. **Digital Twins for Education:** Only 1 article (0.6%) explicitly addresses Digital Twins in educational contexts
2. **Real-time Instructor Support:** Minimal research on technologies supporting instructor evaluation during PBL processes  
3. **Scalable Assessment Architectures:** Limited ISO 42010-compliant system designs for educational assessment
4. **Industry Integration:** Insufficient research on industry-academia collaboration in assessment tool development

This analysis provides crucial baseline data for understanding the current state of PBL assessment technology research and identifies significant opportunities for innovation in Digital Twins modeling and instructor support systems.
