TI  - Code-quality evaluation scheme for assessment of student contributions to programming projects
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
AB  - Project-based learning is the most common approach to software engineering education, due to its emphasis on the teamwork skills essential to real-world collaborations. This study developed an automated programming assessment system (APAS) featuring a code-quality evaluation scheme to overcome difficulties in assessing the contribution of individual team members. Team participation is visualized on a weekly basis to provide insights pertaining to team dynamics, and metrics based on code quality allow the segmentation of students by level of contribution. Insights provided by the proposed system were also shown to facilitate interventions aimed at improving code quality. Empirical analysis based on submission data from 146 students (41 teams) demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed system in monitoring group-based learning projects at the university level, particularly in detecting free-riders.

TI  - Bridging the Gap between Project-Oriented and Exercise-Oriented Automatic Assessment Tools
T2  - COMPUTERS
AB  - In this study, we present the DP Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, designed to extend the Drop Project (DP) Automatic Assessment Tool (AAT) by making it more suitable for handling small exercises in exercise-based learning environments. Our aim was to address the limitations of DP in supporting small assignments while retaining its strengths in project-based learning. The plugin leverages DP's REST API to streamline the submission process, integrating assignment instructions and feedback directly within the IDE. A student survey conducted during the 2022/23 academic year revealed a positive reception, highlighting benefits such as time efficiency and ease of use. Students also provided valuable feedback, leading to various improvements that have since been integrated into the plugin. Despite these promising results, the study is limited by the relatively small percentage of survey respondents. Our findings suggest that an IDE plugin can significantly improve the usability of project-oriented AATs for small exercises, informing the development of future educational tools suitable for mixed project-based and exercise-based learning environments.

TI  - An online progressive peer assessment approach to project-based learning: a constructivist perspective
T2  - ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - How to improve students' problem-solving skills and creativity and adapt them to the new situation of the twenty-first century is a rather important educational objective at present, and is expected to be for a long time to come. Project-based learning (PBL) is considered to be an approach that can develop students' higher-order thinking skills, while peer assessment is a strategy that helps students to interact and reflect. To improve the quality of peer assessment in PBL and to further promote learning by using the feedback of peer assessment, this study proposes an online progressive peer assessment (OPPA)-based PBL approach using constructivism as the theoretical framework for instructional design. The aim of the proposed approach is to organise progressive peer-assessment activities for students as they complete the project, thereby promoting high-quality peer evaluations and continuous reflective improvement of the project. To test the effect of the OPPA-based PBL approach, a quasi-experiment was carried out in an educational game development course with 49 university students from two classes. Students in the experimental group used the OPPA-based PBL approach to develop their game projects, while students in the control group used the conventional PBL approach to develop their game projects. The findings show that the OPPA-based PBL approach significantly improved students' learning achievement, self-efficacy, collective efficacy, problem-solving, and creativity awareness, while also reducing their anxiety levels compared to the conventional PBL approach. The results of this study provide a reference for improving project-based learning, and further demonstrate the importance and validity of constructivist learning theory.

TI  - Teaching Agile Principles and Software Engineering Concepts through Real-Life Projects
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF 2018 IEEE GLOBAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION CONFERENCE (EDUCON) - EMERGING TRENDS AND CHALLENGES OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
AB  - Today employees in IT related areas are expected to know the newest technologies and to be able to apply it independently in their projects. This requires a deeper understanding and additional competences that are not taught in lectures or addressed by Project Based Learning (PBL) approaches. In this paper, an approach to teach software engineering concepts using the Scrum framework in real life projects is presented. It extends the PBL concept with respect to competences. Feedback from students, customers as well as our own experience confirm the benefits of the presented approach.

TI  - A Project-Based Learning Approach for Enhancing Learning Skills and Motivation in Software Engineering
T2  - SIGCSE 2020: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 51ST ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION
AB  - Software engineers must be able to manage complex projects, so that skills such as teamwork, leadership or initiative are critical to their successful development. Because of this, it is fundamental that the learning of software engineering as an academic discipline provides solid links between theory and practice. Educational frameworks such as those derived from the European Higher Education Area state that student-centered approaches are a useful tool for achieving these objectives. In this context, we present a project-based learning (PBL) experience report in a software engineering program of a Spanish university. The experience is based on the formation of small heterogeneous teams, which face the initial phases of a software methodology during the development of a project close to a real one. Through a strategy of role rotation and documentation transfer, all students perform different tasks and face different challenges throughout the project. Summative assessment is also adopted, considering not only teacher ratings but also students' peer assessment. The results prove the positive effect of using PBL to improve the training of students in acquiring different skills as future software engineers.

TI  - Students' Communication Self-efficacy and Its Impact on the Enhancement of Communication Skills in Software Engineering Project Courses
T2  - TEM JOURNAL-TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION MANAGEMENT INFORMATICS
AB  - - Developing the communication skills of software engineering graduates to meet industry requirements is a challenge for educators. This study presents a project-based learning framework that promotes students' communication skills in a software engineering project course. The questionnaire on selfefficacy for software development (CSESD) was designed for students' self-assessment of their confidence in communication skills. Findings indicate that students' CSESD increased significantly after the course ended. Educators can apply the designed framework to software development-related project courses. The CSESD questionnaire can be used to assess students' confidence in their communication skills and assist educators in preparing students' readiness before graduation.

TI  - Meta-assessment in a project-based systems engineering course
T2  - ASSESSMENT & EVALUATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - Project-based learning (PBL) facilitates significant learning, but it poses a major assessment challenge for assessing individual content knowledge. We developed and implemented an assessment approach and tool for a mandatory undergraduate systems engineering PBL-based course. We call this type of assessment student-oriented meta-assessment. Research participants included 131 undergraduate engineering students who carried out team projects requiring conceptual modelling of complex systems. Next, individual students assessed their peer team projects. Finally, the course staff assessed students individually, based on the content knowledge that was reflected in students' comments to their peers, by using the new meta-assessment tool. The research findings validated the meta-assessment tool which can serve for assessing various PBL courses. Our contribution is twofold: a new approach for assessing project-based undergraduate engineering courses, and classification of meta-assessment methods into three types, where a student-oriented meta-assessment as one of the three meta-assessment methods is our newly introduced and validated method.

TI  - Technical projects with social commitment for teaching-learning intervention in STEM students
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 IEEE GLOBAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION CONFERENCE (EDUCON 2020)
AB  - We present a teaching methodology based on active learning that faces new social challenges to obtain better levels of students' motivation and promote their social responsibility. It consists of a project-based learning core that organizes students in teams to design and manufacture autonomy-oriented products capable of assisting people in a dependency situation. We mainly combine open-source software and low-cost machines to make the products. The first experience was implemented in a subject shared by all the 2nd-year engineering degrees during the 2018-19 academic year. We programmed a series of short oral presentations to (i) improve students' time management skills, and (ii) receive periodical feedback across the whole semester. Herein, we report the results from the self-assessment and peer evaluation surveys of the first year of this experience. Peer evaluation was incorporated into the subject's final score. Results showed that our methodology could positively influence students' self-perception of their acquired soft-skills and technical knowledge. The high quality of the deliverables, together with the outstanding final ratings and success rates achieved, seem to be related to the extraordinary levels of students' motivation after this experience.

TI  - Implementation of PjBL With Remote Lab Enhances the Professional Skills of Engineering Students
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
AB  - Contribution:This article describes one approach to foster technical skills (Digital Electronics) and professional skills (critical thinking, problem solving, communication, and collaboration) for Computer Engineering students in a fully remote way. Background:Engineering competencies development requires practical activities. Besides the technical skills, professional skills such as communication are necessary in the workplace. Intended Outcomes:When compared to face-to-face offering, the fully remote course must have no statistically relevant differences in terms of student performance. The course must also support the enhancement of professional skills (e.g., collaboration). Application Design:This study presents a comparison of the face-to-face (one year) and the fully remote (two years) Digital Electronics lab offerings. A course organization framework is proposed with two blocks: 1) controlled experiments and 2) projects in groups of two students. The study investigates how Project-Based Learning and Peer Assessment are perceived by students in the fully remote offering. A total of 110 students participated in the years 2019 (face-to-face), 2020, and 2021 (fully remote). Findings:Students in the second remote course offering (2021) presented a higher performance in their projects than face-to-face students (2019). Besides the student performance and technical skills development, it was observed that problem solving and collaboration, professional skills could be enhanced according to the students' perceptions. However, the same did not occur for critical thinking or communication professional skills even with the Peer Assessment and project pitches. The main concern is the high workload for students.

TI  - The Role of Group Project-Based Learning in Engineering Training
T2  - LEARNING IN THE AGE OF DIGITAL AND GREEN TRANSITION, ICL2022, VOL 2
AB  - Reforming education, changing its role and priorities, stimulating scientific research and innovation has led to the need to find new models of engineering training. In these conditions group project-based learning for both students and engineering teachers seems to be promising. With this in mind, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the specifics of group project-based learning in engineering training and to develop a toolkit for building a graduate profile based on assessments of various key stakeholders. The paper analyzes the opinion of experts, the results of questionnaire survey and interviewing of teachers and students of engineering specialties of universities and colleges in different regions of Kazakhstan about the role of group project-based learning in the integration of engineering educational programs with industry, the results of students' self-assessment of their competencies and skills formed in the process of learning. The results of students' self-assessment and expert assessment ranking allowed to identify five main groups of competencies. Groups 1 and 2 contain interdisciplinary competences, group 3 - organizational competences, self-reflection and control competences, professional and didactic competences, group 4 includes mainly communication and teamwork competences, group 5 - information and analytical competences. The approach used in the work allows highlighting those competences and skills which are underdeveloped within the educational program. The good correlation between the results of students' self-assessment of their formed competences and skills in the process of group project-based learning and the results of expert assessment allows us to consider the method of group project-based learning effective and reliable in maintaining educational goals and achieving the best results in engineers' training. The application of the organizational forms, methods, and tools of group project-based learning proposed in the article allowed us to propose a model of graduate profile creation adapted to the constantly changing requirements for specialists' qualifications and gradation of their skills.

TI  - Assessing individuals within teams in project-based learning courses - Strategies, evaluation and lessons learnt
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2021 IEEE GLOBAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION CONFERENCE (EDUCON)
AB  - Teamwork is an important professional skill for engineers. To ensure that skills like teamwork are a key focus a series of project-based learning courses were introduced throughout the Bachelor of Engineering programme at Massey University. These project-based courses start in first year and continue each year until the final year where they complete a capstone design project. One difficulty identified was how to effectively assess an individual's contribution to a team-based assessment. This paper reports on the strategies used, evaluation of our approach and a reflection on lessons learnt after 5 years of team-based assessment. An example of the strategies used in a first-year course is given as a case study. Data was gathered from final year students over a three-year period to assess their opinions on teamwork and assessment within project-based learning courses. Students reported both positive and negative aspects of working in teams. Over the 3-year period being studied, the number of negative impacts reduced. This may be due to changes to the courses and/or staff becoming more effective facilitators. Half the students felt peer evaluation fairly distributed grades and half felt it did not. The most frequent comment was that marks were not adjusted enough. Success of individual teams often relies on a combination of careful course design, monitoring by staff, early intervention when needed and creating an environment where students feel they can ask for advice.

TI  - PBL from Real Projects and Students Initiative: A Case Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
AB  - The benefits of Project Based Learning (PBL) to acquire technological knowledge as well as transversal skills by students are well known. However, the implementation of PBL requires additional efforts from teachers and students, as well as additional teaching resources when compared to traditional teaching. This paper presents a case study of a singular PBL experience developed within a subject entitled Experimental Structural Analysis. This subject had PBL already implemented. However, the paper describes a new PBL experience that was suggested by some students that were part of the Formula Student (FS) team from the University of Seville. 24 students and 2 teachers took part in this new experience. The proposed PBL introduced some new challenges in the subject. The paper describes how the subject was organized in terms of theoretical and practical lessons, tutorials and assessment (including the introduction of a novel Self Assessment Factor). The paper analyzes the results from an academic point of view and describes the benefits, difficulties, advantages and opportunities arising from a PBL approach in which students play a new role as real promoters of a real project. Results from academic scores, surveys from students and teachers' perceptions are analyzed. The percentage of students who ask the teachers of the subject to supervise their final degree project is used as a new satisfaction indicator from students. The paper shows that this PBL methodolodogy is enriching and suitable for the learning process of most the students. However, new challenges arise such as encouraging all the students to be actually involved in the cooperative work and ensuring that the main theoretical concepts are learned. The FS competition is proven to be a good opportunity for implementing PBL based on a real project.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2018 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH AND EDUCATION IN MECHATRONICS (REM 2018)
AB  - This paper describes the implementation of a project-based learning (PjBL) approach in mechatronics course for the first-year engineering students at ENSGSI (Ecole Nationale Superieure en Genie des Systemes et de l'Innovation) in France. The pedagogy is designed to meet the education plan in forming future innovation engineers. The adopted educational model combines classroom, PjBL and skill-based assessment. The project prototypes are realized using FabLab equipment and Arduino kits. The student skills are assessed by a self-evaluation, a written exam, and a project jury evaluation. Individual competencies of each student are assessed at the beginning of the course and then compared to his/her competencies at the end of the course. The results show how the PjBL with various skill assessments can be applied and how they can improve learning efficiency and student attitudes. The feedback from students is positive, which encourage us to adopt and pursue this pedagogy.

AB  - The specificity of this Project, based on project-based learning (ABP) in the subjects of Fluid Mechanical Engineering in the Degree of Electrical Engineering and Degree of Measurement Engineering, is that it includes collaborative work in teams with foreign students. It incorporates virtual exchange activities carried in English, which allow to improve a large number of soft skills developed thanks to the ABP combination with intercultural interaction. This aims at increasing the motivation of the students, and improving their communicative capacity in English. This proposal will also involve strengthening their teamwork skills, and using new technologies that are basic to enable communication between team members in two different countries. Other skills will also be developed, such as better time management, individual responsibility in the tasks assigned and improved communication for non-experts, since the work has been developed with students of different degrees. Finally, this proposal will be completed by peer assessment making them more aware of their ability and their performance in the tasks.

TI  - Recursive Reflective Reports: Embedded Assessment in PBL Courses for Second Language Teacher Education
T2  - INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL OF PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING
AB  - This conceptual article begins with a general definition of reflection and the soft skills of PBL: collaboration, agency, and metacognition. Then it presents theoretical frameworks for reflection from second language teacher education (SLTE) (Farrell, 2015; Pennington & Richards, 2016) and illustrates six types of reflection with examples from the field of SLTE. The article features a reflective self- and peer-assessment instrument, utilized in a graduate SLTE program. The standard yet flexible template of the reflective teaching report (RTR) allows these teacher educators to interact with their students' development in the soft skills and the content of the SLTE knowledge base. As a recursive tool, instructors use it at the end of each module in most of the courses. Its embedded, recurrent positioning in the program's curriculum system is displayed in diagrams. Data from the program are provided to show how items in the shared RTR template support the types of reflection encouraged theoretically in the field of SLTE and PBL. The reliability and validity of this reflective report is discussed in the context of language assessment qualities of usefulness (Bachman & Palmer, 1996).

TI  - A Unique Approach to Project-Based Learning (PjBL) in a Veterinary Anatomy Course
T2  - MEDICAL SCIENCE EDUCATOR
AB  - Introduction Project-based learning (PjBL) is a teaching methodology designed to engage students in solving real-world problems, acknowledging that students are active agents of their learning process. This methodology has historically been popular in architecture and industrial sciences; however, its use in teaching veterinary anatomy is scarcely published. Methods Using information and communication technologies, the PjBL methodology was implemented in a first-year veterinary anatomy course. The methodology included teamwork and the selection of a routine object in the veterinary clinic at the beginning of the academic semester. The project's goal was to analyze the object and associate it with both a domestic animal species and an anatomical region, along with making and presenting a video or a simulation model about the object. Results More than 80% of students prefer active learning classes compared to traditional classes. In addition, 66% and 86% of students indicate that PjBL allowed them to improve their understanding of theoretical content for the first and second years of post-implementation, respectively. Students' self-assessment indicates that more than 80% of the students (first and second year post-implementation) felt they were responsible for the execution of the project, able to conduct research, and able to develop autonomous learning skills. After 2 years of PjBL implementation, failure rates in the course decreased by 21%. Discussion In general, PjBL results show that veterinary students prefer active learning activities that allow them to learn in a team-based learning process as well as to develop soft skills such as self-learning, responsibility, and teamwork.

AB  - In the context of the transformation of the modern higher education system, the supra-professional competencies (soft skills) necessary for future specialists in the humanitarian field, in particular, social educators, are of particular importance. The present study is aimed at studying the effectiveness of problem-based learning (PBL) as a method of forming key soft skills among students of the educational program "Social Pedagogy" of the L.N. Gumilyov Eurasian National University. The theoretical part of the study includes an overview of international and domestic scientific discourse on flexible skills and a problem-oriented approach. In the empirical part, the methods of pedagogical experimentation, questionnaires, self-assessment of competencies, and quantitative analysis of the dynamics of soft skill development during the semester were applied. The results indicate a positive correlation between the intensity of students' participation in PBL practices and the level of development of skills such as critical thinking, teamwork, communicative competence, and time management. The study also identified institutional and methodological barriers to the implementation of PBL in Kazakhstan's educational practice, including the lack of trained facilitators and the lack of adapted cases. Based on the data obtained, a model of a localized PBL strategy integrated into the training of social educators is proposed. The research contributes to the development of the methodological culture of teacher education and opens up prospects for creating a sustainable system of soft skills formation in universities in Kazakhstan.

TI  - Self-efficacy in engineering design through peer review, self-review, and interactive online tutorials
T2  - 2022 IEEE IFEES WORLD ENGINEERING EDUCATION FORUM - GLOBAL ENGINEERING DEANS COUNCIL, WEEF-GEDC
AB  - Self-regulated learning is a key attribute in tertiary engineering education, and forms the basis of engineering judgement. The experience of remote learning during the COVID-19 era revealed particular challenges in self-regulated student learning practices, but also resulted in a number of systemic, technology-based interventions to enable improved student learning. Drawing on a 3rd-year electronic design course case study at a contact-based engineering faculty in South Africa, this paper presents an approach to bridging the gap between student perceptions and their actual assessment performance during independent, remote learning. Using scaffolded reflective and peer learning strategies, the research team sought to answer the question: What is the impact on self-efficacy of frequent self- and peer-assessment opportunities across a range of project-based learning tasks? Results were analysed using Bandura's four self-efficacy 'mastery' and experiential domains, and indicate an improvement in alignment between perceptions and actual performance. We suggest that a well-designed, scaffolded set of assignments with reflective and peer-learning opportunities can contribute significantly to the development of student confidence and mastery.

TI  - Boosting computer-aided design pedagogy using interactive self-assessment graphical tools
T2  - COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION
AB  - Computer-aided design (CAD) tools are essential for any engineer and, thus, many researchers have focused on developing the most suitable method for acquiring CAD competences. In recent years, efforts have been devoted to designing new, innovative and helpful methodologies to improve the CAD pedagogy. The presented research aims at showing the advantages of integrating interactive self-assessment tools into CAD learning methodologies, such as problem-based learning (PBL). One hundred and ninety-one first-year Mechanical Engineering students participated in the research. They were evenly and randomly divided into two groups: a control group and an experimental group. Students belonging to the control group made use of PBL. The experimental group made use of PBL and a new interactive tool, called TrainCAD, that allows the self-assessment of 2D-CAD models designed in AutoCAD. The presented results show that experimental group students have considerably improved their academic performance and increased their motivation on the subject. Therefore, the combination of the two proposed approaches seems to be useful for helping students during the CAD learning process. On the other hand, gender was also a factor that has been analysed, to discern whether it influences the proposed academic learning process (based on the applied CAD pedagogy), concluding that there is no significant influence.

TI  - Innovating forest science education through problem-based learning: Insights from a public university in Brazil
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The evolving market's demand for forest science professionals with dynamic skills and interdisciplinary knowledge calls for an urgent and renewed look at forest science education methods to produce professionals ready to tackle 'real world' challenges and climate change issues. Integrating problem-based learning (PBL) in forest science education offers a promising avenue to align the current demand for dynamic forest science professionals and teaching approaches in forest science programs. However, while PBL has been extensively studied in various educational settings, limited research studies document its application in forest sciences education, particularly in the context of Brazilian public universities. This study explores the perceived learning outcomes of a group of forest engineering students exposed to PBL and the challenges associated with implementing it in a public university in Brazil. We developed a survey to assess the perceived learning outcomes of 32 students exposed to the PBL methodology. The survey instrument comprised nine questions designed to measure students' self-assessment of learning outcomes. Overall, we found that students reported the development of skills in field experience, technical knowledge, teamwork, communication, interpersonal relationship, and more. The findings from this study highlight the potential of PBL in forest science education and provide insights into how this approach can better prepare students to become dynamic forest science professionals.

TI  - Toward Creating Software Architects Using Mobile Project-Based Learning Model (Mobile-PBL) for Teaching Software Architecture
T2  - MULTIMODAL TECHNOLOGIES AND INTERACTION
AB  - Project-based learning (PBL) promotes increased levels of learning, deepens student understanding of acquired knowledge, and improves learning motivation. Students develop their ability to think and learn independently through depending on themselves in searching for knowledge, planning, exploration, and looking for solutions to practical problems. Information availability, student engagement, and motivation to learn all increase with mobile learning. The teaching process may be enhanced by combining the two styles. This paper proposes and evaluates a teaching model called Mobile Project-Based Learning (Mobile-PBL) that combines the two learning styles. The paper investigates how significantly Mobile-PBL can benefit students. The traditional lecture method used to teach the software architecture module in the classroom is not sufficient to provide students with the necessary practical experience to earn a career as software architects in the future. Therefore, the first author tested the use of the model for teaching the software architecture module at Philadelphia University's Software Engineering Department on 62 students who registered for a software architecture course over three semesters. She compared the results of using the model for teaching with those results that were obtained when using the project-based learning (PBL) approach alone. The students' opinions regarding the approach, any problems they had, and any recommendations for improvement were collected through a focus group session after finishing each semester and by distributing a survey to students to evaluate the effectiveness of the used model. Comments from the students were positive, according to the findings. The projects were well-received by the students, who agreed that it gave them a good understanding of several course ideas and concepts, as well as providing them with the required practical experience. The students also mentioned a few difficulties encountered while working on the projects, including student distraction from social media and the skills that educators and learners in higher education institutions are expected to have.

TI  - Project and Team-Based Strategies for Teaching Software Architecture
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
AB  - Software Architecture remains a difficult topic to teach. This is because of the problem's complexity, and the integration of interpersonal and technical skills with knowledge from different areas. This paper presents the introduction of Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Team-Based Learning (TBL) in a Software Architecture undergraduate course. The goal for students is to apply in practice the concepts learned using ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) to evaluate case studies of real-world architecture. PBL is known for allowing students to experiment with realistic problems and improve their negotiation and communication skills. TBL offers a different approach to group-based activities, by using them to determine the structure of the course. This approach is applied in an optional course in a Systems Engineering degree; its results are positive, having increased students' attendance and active participation levels. A student survey also shows acceptance of the new methodology.

TI  - The Investigation of Logistic Regression Methods Applied to Engineering Education using Project Based Learning for Airport Systems Design
T2  - 2021 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE 2021)
AB  - This is a work in progress on the research-to-practice to advance engineering development using logistic regression design methods in engineering education through project-based learning (PBL) activities. The aviation community has witnessed a growing concern with safety and security issues due to system vulnerability of manned and unmanned aircrafts. The implementation PBL in engineering education with major airports identified the benefits of this investigation as a multi-disciplinary approach to address system vulnerabilities and analysis design approaches. This investigation includes defined methods and the factors to assess undergoing efforts of environment threats associated with complex networked systems in aviation through analysis design activities with machine learning. The ability to examine the analysis design allows learners in engineering education to deploy methods that will assess the combination of techniques and security consideration through machine learning. This project comprised of a collected dataset of network traces and malicious traffic that requires a solution and strategic model based on various scenarios to improve the software architecture design. Aviation safety and security standards are critical to the degree in which threats are constituted as each node within the network determined specific case studies for evaluation. This approach will feature a dataset that assess the spam detection categorization from a human behavior perspective and the factors to formulate data mining techniques and models in R programming language. The framework adopts the use of logistic regression and proposed techniques of the performance baseline to explore a systematic approach in the engineering design process. PBL in engineering education revealed a viewpoint from interdisciplinary approach as this study will have a wide range of features in the design analysis (e.g., revealing unwanted electronic information spread causing concerns and environmental threats to the aviation community). This study is developed to examine a common framework for processing and structuring a model using logistic regression analysis to classify key elements in the engineering process and PBL activities.

TI  - What about using a project management Agile methodology supported by online platforms in the classroom?
T2  - 2018 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE PORTUGUESE SOCIETY FOR ENGINEERING EDUCATION (CISPEE)
AB  - Project-based Learning (PBL) is one of the most heard buzzwords within academic discourses in the last decade. It represents a shift in the way the study of engineering is conducted in undergraduate and even graduate programs. However, despite its popularity, the application of PBL is specific to each engineering area and subject. In this paper, we present our experience in applying PBL to two subjects of computer science: Software Engineering and Distributed Systems. We describe how we use online platforms to implement PBL principles and discuss the impact of our approach on the learning performance of students. The automation of work assignments along with the adoption of an Agile methodology from the software industry for collaboration between students, allowed us to implement a continuous evaluation framework that promotes the motivation and the continuous work of students.

TI  - A Web-based Learning System using Project-based Learning and Imagineering
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING
AB  - A web-based learning system using project-based learning and Imagineering relies on the online operation, which can be operated on all kinds of computers and mobile devices. The objectives of the development of this web-based learning system are to encourage the freedom of self-learning, to promote interaction and cooperation based on the concepts and theories of project-based learning and Imagineering learning, and to create instructional activities based on the new concepts corresponding to characteristic development of learners in the 21st century, which enables the learners to have creativity and ability to generate new innovation. Regarding the architecture design, the researcher employed the concepts of mixed learning process, which is the combination of project-based learning and Imagineering learning, in order to support the instructional process within the system. Also, the researcher relied on the flexible instructional activities and instructional management system so that the learners could acquire the efficient learning from the system. Moreover, there was a variety of communication devices to support and promote the collaboration and activities within the system. The results of this research can be summarized as follow: (1) The system architecture consists of three main elements, i.e. 1.1) Stakeholders; 1.2) System Components, i.e. Learning process, Activity, System Element, and Communication Tools; and 1.3) Database; (2) Learning process within the system consists of six steps, corresponding to the Imagineering learning, i.e. 1) Imagine 2) Design 3) Develop 4) Present 5) Improvement and 6) Evaluate; and (3) The web-based learning system, can be divided into two systems: 1) Student system; and 2) Lecturer system and administrator system.

TI  - TEAMSCOPE: Measuring Software Engineering Processes with Teamwork Telemetry
T2  - ITICSE'18: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD ANNUAL ACM CONFERENCE ON INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION
AB  - Project-based learning is an important teaching method in software engineering education. However, it is unclear how student projects can be evaluated objectively and systematically in classrooms. Measurements used in industry, such as quality of the codebase, are not the only expected outcomes in classrooms; informative assessments in project-based learning require more details about how students behave as individuals and as a team. In this paper, we establish the importance of measuring processes in project-based software engineering courses and present metrics mined from software development tools for monitoring and observing processes to facilitate teaching. A case study at a US university confirms that 1) teams with better conformance to software development processes achieve better outcomes, and 2) our approach can be used to design metrics that serve as early detectors of violations to software development processes. Our results suggest that instructors for software engineering courses can use our approach to design process metrics for systematic, targeted, and automatic evaluation of team projects. Furthermore, metrics designed using our approach can be used as building blocks for automated systems, and thus increase the scalability of project-based software engineering courses.

TI  - From Experience to Inquiry to Generalization: Understanding the STEM-PBL Learning Process and Developing a Formative Assessment Model
T2  - RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION
AB  - As an effective teaching strategy and learning mode in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, STEM project-based learning (STEM-PBL) has gained global acceptance among teachers and students. However, there is a lack of research on the STEM-PBL learning process, and no relevant model to guide STEM-PBL formative assessment. Therefore, this study aims to explore the STEM-PBL learning process and then develop a formative assessment model to support learning and assessment activities based on this process. We developed hypotheses on relationships in the STEM-PBL learning process based on Whitehead's educational philosophy of "the rhythm of education," which informed the design of the formative assessment model. Data were analyzed from 304 Chinese elementary school students in STEM clubs. Study results show: (1) The STEM-PBL learning process consists of "STEM-PBL Experience" "STEM-PBL Inquiry" and "STEM-PBL Generalization," with each positive impact existing between the stages. In addition, the STEM-PBL Inquiry stage mediates the relationship between the STEM-PBL Experience stage and the STEM-PBL Generalization stage. (2) The formative assessment model based on the STEM-PBL learning process is well-founded. "Engineering design" "Hands-on inquiry" and "Behavioral participation" are the assessment elements that should be valued in each stage of the STEM-PBL learning process. The model constructed in this study can help students develop a clear mind of their learning process and provide teachers with strategies for designing STEM-PBL formative assessment activities.

TI  - Online Project-Based Learning and Formative Assessment
T2  - TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING
AB  - Project-based learning (PBL) involves a highly complex and learner-centered approach. It relies on formative assessment (FA) with ongoing feedback to help learners move through the PBL process to the eventual co-construction of a shared artefact. Conversation and discussion are central to the process. However, in a face-to-face context of learning, they are difficult to capture for later review or reflection as part of FA. This study investigates the role that technology might play in addressing this limitation using online PBL and FA in a media-creation course in a Thai university. Participants were undergraduate, pre-service teachers preparing to teach English as a foreign language. Objectives included the local design and implementation of online PBL and FA; identification of pre-service teachers' (n = 28) post-implementation perceptions of the convenience, benefits and barriers of this form of learning; perceptions of their PBL skills and; post-implementation measures of PBL knowledge and skills compared with learners participating in a face-to-face section of the course (n = 30). Results revealed that the technology provided a foundational scaffold to support both the learners' and the instructor's activity and interaction. The design of a simple learning management system with communication and file-sharing tools supported not only the learners, but the instructor, not only the assessment, but the learning. Learners' perceptions were positive and post-implementation measures of PBL knowledge and skill were significantly higher for the online section.

TI  - Data Science Course Design for a Large-Scale Cohort using Individual Project-Based Learning
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 7TH CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING EDUCATION PRACTICE, CEP 2023
AB  - Being an effective data scientist includes mastering many skills, both technical and analytical. There are many great teaching resources for learning technical skills. However, the analytical skills of understanding customer values, proposing causal relationships and gathering datasets are less common. This paper describes a new data science course designed to emphasize these analytical skills using individual project-based learning (PBL). PBL is considered to be a valuable teaching approach in computer science education. However, such courses typically have large-scale cohorts, resulting in PBL being used as group work. Our approach using individual PBL, circumvents issues concerning team dynamics and individual student assessment within group work. This course is designed to work for a large-scale (75+) postgraduate cohort of both full- and part-time students. To facilitate the large-scale cohort the course makes use of a virtual learning environment (VLE) and recorded lectures. Students were able to choose the subject of their project and what software they would use to create visualizations. This paper provides details of a novel approach to teaching data science using individual PBL for a large-scale cohort while maintaining education quality.

TI  - Beyond measure: using cogenerative dialogues as a formative assessment to improve PBL science internships
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION PART B-COMMUNICATION AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
AB  - Project-based learning has been suggested as an effective student-centered practice to teach science. However, how to assess students' learning in project-based learning activities remains challenging because of its open-ended nature. In this study of high school students' science internships, we demonstrated that cogenerative dialogs can serve as a formative assessment to improve teaching and learning in project-based teaming activities. Cogenerative dialogs provided a safe and supportive space for respectful and equitable dialogs. In cogenerative dialogs, both instructors and students identified areas for improvements and brainstormed solutions as a team. As a result, students were empowered to speak up their voices and willing to take on the responsibility for their learning. The regular cogenerative dialogs became an effective form of formative assessments to improve both the teaching and learning involved in the science internships. By analyzing these cogenerative dialogs, we identified eight key strategies used by participants in cogenerative dialogs to justify and assess the internship teaching and learning. These key strategies may serve as a framework to observe how instruction revolutions and feedback are intertwined and how students become engaged in assessing themselves and their peers in formative assessments.

TI  - Project based learning (PBL): Assessment from the Perspective of Primary Level Students
T2  - RIE-REVISTA DE INVESTIGACION EDUCATIVA
AB  - Given the consolidation of project based learning (PBL) and its ever more frequent use in schools as a mechanism to develop curricular competences, increase student motivation and self-esteem, foster research and promote collaboration (Railsback, 2002), we designed an assessment scale for project based learning from the perspective of the students, guaranteeing its validity and reliability. The scale was administered to 364 students of Primary Education to analyze the results of different collaborative learning projects and to see whether there were differences in the assessments in terms of gender and type of project. Among the main results it can be highlighted that in students' opinion, the projects proposed in class were well-organized, the tasks were well-defined, and the group size were adequate; moreover, the teachers provided the necessary help and feedback regarding the students' achievements while they stimulated student interaction and collaborative learning in which a good working climate was shared and fostered. Inferential analyses showed that there were significant differences in terms of project type, but not as a function of gender.

TI  - IMPROVING PROJECT-BASED LEARNING OUTCOMES BY FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT AND STRATEGIC TIME OPTIMIZATION
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION, 2016, VOL. 5
AB  - The 3rd year Electrical Engineering Design Studio (EEDS) course is a project-based learning (PBL) course that gives students hands-on experience with putting electrical engineering principles into practice. It is an electro-mechanical project which provides a particular challenge since electrical engineering students often lack mechanical design skills. It is found here that learning outcomes are improved by a 2-stage formative assessment and time optimization strategy that allows students to extract as much value as possible out of the limited time they have to devote to this exercise. It consists of an innovative assessment strategy that includes formal, informal and self assessments, and an innovative budgeting, lecture scheduling, parts distribution, and order queueing system. The impact on efficiency is shown through an end-of-term student survey and a subjective evaluation of their work, in comparison to the previous year.

TI  - A Project-Based Learning Approach for Enhancing Learning Skills and Motivation in Software Engineering
T2  - SIGCSE 2020: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 51ST ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION
AB  - Software engineers must be able to manage complex projects, so that skills such as teamwork, leadership or initiative are critical to their successful development. Because of this, it is fundamental that the learning of software engineering as an academic discipline provides solid links between theory and practice. Educational frameworks such as those derived from the European Higher Education Area state that student-centered approaches are a useful tool for achieving these objectives. In this context, we present a project-based learning (PBL) experience report in a software engineering program of a Spanish university. The experience is based on the formation of small heterogeneous teams, which face the initial phases of a software methodology during the development of a project close to a real one. Through a strategy of role rotation and documentation transfer, all students perform different tasks and face different challenges throughout the project. Summative assessment is also adopted, considering not only teacher ratings but also students' peer assessment. The results prove the positive effect of using PBL to improve the training of students in acquiring different skills as future software engineers.

TI  - Harnessing Generative AI to Enhance Feedback Quality in Peer Evaluations within Project-Based Learning Contexts
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
AB  - This paper explores using generative artificial intelligence (AI) large language models (LLMs) to augment traditional peer feedback processes within project-based learning (PBL) environments where students work in teams. Our study contributes to the expanding digital educational frontier by harnessing the power of LLMs for summarizing and enhancing self and peer feedback. We present a novel educational innovation that utilizes GPT-4 to effectively summarize self and peer comments for student teams in PBL courses. Our research involved the development of a specific prompt grounded in relevant educational theories and the analysis of 118 AI-summarized Performance Feedback Reports that were generated for students. The findings reveal that the LLM significantly improves the quality of peer feedback by making it more constructive and actionable, addresses off-topic or inappropriate comments, and provides a meaningful comparison between a student's self-evaluation and peer comments. Our paper underscores the importance of peer feedback systems as valuable pedagogical tools in PBL classes and demonstrates how AI tools can enhance these systems. The outcomes of this research serve as a foundational guide for faculty, especially those teaching in PBL environments with student teams, who are considering using AI to enhance teaching and learning. We demonstrate the potential of integrating these innovative practices in PBL classrooms to support students' development of teamwork skills, marking a significant step towards a new digital frontier in engineering education.

TI  - Implementation of Project Based Learning: Lessons Learned
T2  - 2019 XLV LATIN AMERICAN COMPUTING CONFERENCE (CLEI 2019)
AB  - Project Based Learning (PBL) is a teaching and learning methodology where students develop projects under real conditions to acquire the knowledge and develop the skills required for their profession. In this article we discuss the lessons learned from two teachers who implemented different PBL approaches in three courses from the Bachelor in Computer and Informatics at the University of Costa Rica, during three semesters. We discuss the main considerations and decisions associated to project design elements and teaching practices. Among the main benefits identified by teachers when using PBL are the high motivation of students and the natural development of soft skills. Among the greatest challenges are (1) the design of learning assessment, considering technical aspects, soft skills, self- and peer- evaluations; (2) continuous feedback to students on their progress in the project and in team dynamics (and its consequent time investment); and (3) the necessary balance between designing a challenging and realistic project that enables the achievement of the course's learning objectives. We recommend the use of agile methodologies such as Scrum, which align very well with PBL principles, as well as the use of hybrid PBL methodologies, which include complementary didactic strategies to achieve the learning objectives of the course.

TI  - Evaluating Individual Contributions in Teams for Project-Based Learning in Data Science
T2  - 2024 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE, FIE
AB  - In this Innovative-Practice Full Paper, we present the design and implementation of a novel strategy for the assessment of the individual contributions of students working in teams for an interdisciplinary project-based learning (PBL) course. Team-based and project-based learning have been the cornerstones of experiential learning in recent years. In such courses, the assessment of students is often performed solely at a team level, resulting in student discontent, concerns about fairness, and social loafing. The application of a single method for evaluating individual contributions has its shortcomings, prompting us to incorporate a combination of evidence-based approaches. Thus, to mitigate these problems, we developed an assessment strategy that involves three components - self and peer evaluation (SPA), instructor's evaluation of individual contribution, and class participation. Anonymized SPA was carried out at three different checkpoints over the semester for both formative and summative assessment. The individual contribution of the students is also evaluated by the instructor and/or other mentors based on their interactions with all the students in the team over the entire semester. Class participation is another component of individual contribution incorporated in our scheme, where instructors evaluate the participation of individual students in classroom activities, presentations, and meetings. We collected feedback about the perception of students towards our assessment policies for individual contribution. We observed overall satisfaction and positive attitudes toward our scheme. We noted positive student perceptions of fairness in grading through our scheme and reduced chances of social loafing. Further, in the feedback, the students noted the effectiveness of using SPA as an evaluation tool, the usefulness of instructor's evaluation, and the role of class participation in creating a more engaging classroom and a more enriching experience. We also emphasize the need to set clear expectations for students with regard to the grading policies early in the semester. Finally, we discuss our experiences in implementing our design and recommendations for incorporating our grading scheme in team-based PBL courses.

T2  - INVESTIGACION EN EDUCACION MATEMATICA XX
AB  - Nowadays, socio-constructivist approaches to mathematics teaching and learning need assessment procedures which are coherent with this vision. A proposal for articulating formative assessment is presented aimed at adapting to the progress and needs of secondary students that use Project Based Learning methodology. By means of a teaching experiment, carried out at a mathematics class of 2nd level of CSE, a procedure for sharing learning goals with students is implemented, together with a "traffic lights" system that allows students' self-assessment throughout the project and teacher 's provision of continuous feedback. Results show the usefulness of the system for students, by allowing them to know the learning goals and to work on their weak points, which entails a significant improvement in their academic results. It also serves the teacher for a systematic planning of tasks and of appropriate tools for providing feedback and help to the students.

T2  - ICERI2015: 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION
AB  - In this paper we show the results of the implementation of the Project Based Learning (PBL) in Power Electronics subject with a large group of students. This case study with more than sixty students, has highlighted some areas that will require further development of the PBL methodology: firstly, the management of classroom, laboratory and off-campus time, the students perception of the efficient and productive use of this time, and the improvement in the use of teacher and student time; secondly, the combination of the theoretical knowledge applied in the developed project with the essential knowledge for final exams as a required part of students final assessment; and lastly, the individual student assessment reflecting the students work and learning in the subject. The aim of the project has been to integrate different tools, involved in the learning process, into a compact scenario based on real applications, as applied to the power electronic field. The analysis of students' opinion surveys during the last two years and the comparison of academic results over the last five years combined with the teachers experience during this time, show an encouraging scenario that will be improved for further development of the PBL methodology.

TI  - Robotic system education for young children by collaborative-project-based learning
T2  - COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION
AB  - This paper presents the fusion of project-based learning (PBL) and collaborative learning (CL) cohesively, coordinated with sensors and Bluetooth advancements, open-source programming, and open-source equipment devices, in a specific microcontroller and installed frameworks designing apply autonomy course for the elementary learners. The major purpose of this study is to evaluate the significance of integrating PBL and CL. The course creates capacities and abilities in critical thinking, problem-solving, independent learning, collaboration, and specialized technical information. Since PBL alone does not guarantee profoundly talented cooperation, it was supplemented with CL. This structure coordinated course substance and understudy pragmatic accomplishment in a reenacted learning environment. The understudies built a line following and Bluetooth-controlled robots by actualizing control programming on the "Arduino" open-source platform, just as utilizing remote interchanges as Arduino offers an instinctive advancement condition and different equipment and programming resources that permit quick improvement of microcontroller-based ventures. The basic findings of this study work reveal that teaching, learning, and student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL when integrated with CL. The research successfully extends onto another group of learners for preparing similar gadgets under different timelines. In addition, this paper also discusses upon the problem identification, selection of the equipment, circuit design, hardware mounting, and critical analysis of the results acquired from the course through the personal learning experience of the teachers as well as in the form of feedback from the two groups of young learners.

TI  - Does Project-Based Learning (PBL) Promote Student Learning? A Performance Evaluation
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - The purpose of the study on which this paper is based was to conduct a performance evaluation of student learning for an introductory course in project management in a higher educational institution in Norway. This was done by utilizing performance measurement philosophy to evaluate perceived student learning after a project-based assignment was applied as an instructional tool. The evaluation was conducted at the end of the semester to determine whether it facilitated learning effectiveness by providing an authentic learning experience. Relevant learning criteria were identified from existing literature and were measured by means of a questionnaire survey. Ten measurement scales were established using a 5-point Likert scale. The survey was then rolled out for the same subject for two consecutive semesters for just over 100 project management students. The results indicated that the incorporation of project-based assignments has a positive impact on student learning, motivation, and performance both in the short and long term. The study finally revealed that the incorporation of project-based assignments enables the creation of real-life experiences, which further stimulates the creation and development of real-life competencies.

TI  - STUDENT ASSESSMENT IN TEAM PROJECT-BASED LEARNING: CHALLENGES AND EXPERIENCES
T2  - 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES (EDULEARN17)
AB  - The final year of the Bachelor of Aerospace Engineering agree at RMIT University includes a capstone aerospace design project involving student teams working together to develop a concept solution to a given requirement. Project-based learning (PBL) is an important part of engineering education where student teams work together to achieve a common objective and acquire a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world challenges and problems. In industry, engineering projects are a collaborative effort of a team of professional engineers, managers, regulators, finance officers, etc. and by replicating this environment in education students learn how to work with fellow students, who have different skills, abilities, motivation, enthusiasm, work ethics and drive, to solve a real-world problem. Although it is generally accepted that this experience is very valuable in preparing students for the workplace, the challenge from a course coordinator's perspective is how to manage these groups and how to determine a transparent and fair assessment scheme. This paper introduces some of the challenges of individual student assessment in group projects and will give an overview of some of the techniques applied in tertiary education, supported by the experiences at RMIT University with the capstone aircraft design project.

TI  - CITIZEN SCIENCE AS STRATEGY OF PROJECT-BASED LEARNING IN A PROGRAM OF ENGINEERING SYSTEMS
T2  - 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI2017)
AB  - A lot of engineering programs in universities are designed according with international standards. Associations like IEEE, AIM, AIS and organizations like ABET [2] and ASIIN [3] among others, define characteristics and skills related to team working, multidisciplinary issues and collaborative tasks. Institutions that want to measure these abilities, often work with project-based learning (PBL), a pedagogical strategy that eases the creation of multidisciplinary spaces, where the students participate with their abilities and knowledge. However, some classroom projects present challenges as:(i) planning of schedule considering the time required for developing a solution, against the time needed for getting the knowledge to develop it, (ii) student awareness of the impact that the solution has in the problem domain and (iii) commitment of students with projects that last for more than one semester.

TI  - Combining Flipped Classroom, Project-Based Learning, and Formative Assessment Strategies in Engineering Studies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
AB  - This paper presents a methodology that encourages and fosters proactive student participation in individual and collaborative learning. The methodology combines Flipped Classroom, Formative Assessment and Continuous Assessment, Project-Based Learning, and Problem Solving using Simulators strategies, with an integrated teaching and learning system (ITLS), called SIENA. The tool serves to automate some of the processes inherent in the methodology and serves as a bridge across all of the educational process involved. The methodology has been tested in both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in Computer Engineering studies, the former in a blended learning subject and the last in an online subject findings to date have proven positive. In addition, we have applied a unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model to ITLS and it has proven to be a useful tool in the learning process.

TI  - Enhancing Chinese Language Education Through AI-Assisted Project-Based Learning: A Qualitative Study on Learning Values and Multimedia Skills Development
T2  - 32ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, ICCE 2024, VOL I
AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore the value of AI-assisted project-based learning design in Chinese language education. Through instructional design that integrates foreign language, cross-cultural understanding, and multimedia expression, we aim to enhance learners' proactive attitudes and improve learning outcomes using AI and ICT. Conducted the tourism Chinese course at a Japanese university, the research employed mixed methods to assess the effectiveness of integrated PBL. The course utilized AI and ICT tools such as an online whiteboard, a pronunciation practice tool, generative AI for writing assistance, and a video editing application. Data from student surveys, feedback, and teacher observations indicated that approximately half of the students found the AI-supported PBL effective for their learning needs, especially in pronunciation practice and video editing, though it didn't fully address speaking skill inaccuracies. AI and ICT tools were effective in supporting cultural knowledge and intercultural communication skills, but student evaluation of AI's impact on learning were polarized. The value of the CFL approach using AI and ICT was discovered in creating immersive, adaptive learning environments-a value that had gone unnoticed in traditional teaching and learning methods-while also underscoring the need for proper support and training from teachers. Future challenges include integrating AI literacy into language courses and addressing varying technological proficiency levels among students.

TI  - Beyond technology: factors influencing the effects of teachers' audio feedback on students' project-based learning
T2  - TECHNOLOGY PEDAGOGY AND EDUCATION
AB  - The effects of teachers' audio feedback on students' project-based learning and its influencing factors have seldom been empirically explored in the higher education context. To address this research gap, a group of Hong Kong freshmen (18-23 years old) and their teachers were involved in this study. Data were collected from students' retrospective journals, post-journal interviews and teacher interviews after the participants experienced audio feedback during their group projects in a General Education course. The findings demonstrated that teachers' audio feedback enhanced students' learning engagement, critical thinking and project output. The students also reported that audio feedback provided convenience, timeliness, rich information, asynchronous discussion and social presence. Other factors including the features of audio feedback, communication between student and teacher on the received feedback and their learning motivation were also crucial in determining the effects of audio feedback on student project-based learning.

TI  - Integration of different assessment approaches: application to a project-based learning engineering course
T2  - EDUCATION FOR CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
AB  - Formative assessment and self-, peer- and co-evaluation strategies for assessing students' learning have been developed and applied, over two academic years, to 75 students on a project-based learning course in the Chemical Engineering Degree at Cantabria University (Spain). The project proposed for teamwork learning in the Process Design course was the preliminary design of a second-generation bioethanol plant. Rubrics of formative assessment and evaluation generated positive reinforcement for the student advancing through the consecutive learning stages. The negotiated co-evaluation process has proved to be an effective tool for reflecting the distinctive contributions of each working group member, which are then successfully incorporated in the final individual mark set by the teachers. Students' perceptions regarding the proposed assessment approaches have been obtained by creating and applying an anonymous and voluntary survey instrument. The active participation of the students in the design and application of rubrics using specific criteria is proposed for peer-assessment processes in learning activities with high qualitative content and more susceptible to subjective capabilities such as oral presentations. We consider that the assessment, learning methodology and the experience gained with the survey results contribute to enhanced achievement of the learning outcomes, and to enhanced quality in the teaching-learning process.

TI  - Gaining Student Engagement Through Project-Based Learning: A Competitive 2D Game Construction Case Study
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - In this work we consider an open artificial intelligence game as a matter of study within the lectures of artificial intelligence to combat lack of motivation and increase engagement within the classroom. During formation, students in computer science can deal with moderately complex projects, nevertheless, dealing with such problems is relegated to the Degree Final Project. In this investigation we show the procedural steps of how project-based learning combined with game construction can effectively be used to promote engagement in informatic lectures at university. For the task, we build a 2D game engine and propose students to enroll in factitious research teams with the aim of programming intelligent agents that play the game employing artificial intelligence techniques. The intended principal outcome is to show evidence of the application of project-based learning in artificial intelligence within the lectures, and how it can be combined with game construction to increase motivation in the classroom. Project-based learning has the students learn, organize, and solve challenges while students themselves remain their own responsible for the investigation and process of work. We propose to follow a series of sequential phases that conform a set of milestones that incorporate a project-based learning approach to the lectures. Through this work we show that the use of project-based learning combined with game construction provides reliable evidence that a much deeper understanding about artificial intelligence is attained by students participating in the challenge. Student evaluation questionnaires and final grade results attained by students indicate that students remained more engaged during the semester in comparison to previous semesters in which lack of motivation was reported.

TI  - Promote healthy living and well-being with the use of project-based learning collaboratively between subjects
T2  - RETOS-NUEVAS TENDENCIAS EN EDUCACION FISICA DEPORTE Y RECREACION
AB  - In Chile, the study plans and programs are oriented to the traditional model of education, despite this, the Ministry of Education promotes that the establishments work in a collaborative and interdisciplinary way, through guidelines, which recommend the use of active methodologies such as Project-Based Learning (PBL). For these reasons, the objective of this experience is to present an interdisciplinary classroom project whose theme is: physical activity and healthy eating and the final product is the creation of a recipe book of medicinal herbs. To implement it, the teachers have worked collaboratively between all the subjects based on a planning focused on the sixth grade of a rural establishment, with the main subjects being: Physical Education and Health and Natural Sciences. Based on the theme: active and healthy life and through the interests of the students, they have developed the project using formative assessment to grade the experience. This has represented the common work between the teachers and offers an opportunity for the use of Project-Based Learning in the Chilean educational system. However, it is noted that the study programs do not present information on the use of these active methodologies.

TI  - Undertaking Educational Research Following the Introduction, Implementation, Evolution, and Hybridization of Constructivist Instructional Models in an Australian PBL High School
T2  - INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL OF PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING
AB  - The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the introduction, implementation, evolution, hybridization, and initial research into the constructivist instructional models deployed within a secondary (high) school in Australia. A concomitant aim is to relate some of the consequences of whole school pedagogical change, which have included the implementation of project-and problem-based learning, the flipped classroom, and a derivative hybridized form, referred to here as "flipped PBL." Moreover, after a decade of using constructivist approaches, we initiated educational research to better understand some of the effects of these changes and to explore the reasons behind the successful implementation of the models. While still in its infancy, the nature of this research and some of the preliminary findings are detailed here.

TI  - Project-Based Learning Applied to Unmanned Aerial Systems and Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology and the miniaturization of sensors have changed the way remote sensing (RS) is used, popularizing this geoscientific discipline in other fields, such as precision agriculture. This makes it necessary to implement the use of these technologies in teaching RS alongside the classical platforms (satellite and manned aircraft). This manuscript describes how The Higher Technical School of Agricultural Engineering at the University of Cordoba (Spain) has introduced UAV RS into the academic program by way of project-based learning (PBL). It also presents the basic characteristics of PBL, the design of the subject, the description of the teacher-guided and self-directed activities, as well as the degree of student satisfaction. The teaching and learning objectives of the subject are to learn how to determine the vigor, temperature, and water stress of a crop through the use of RGB, multispectral, and thermographic sensors onboard a UAV platform. From the onset, students are motivated, actively participate in the tasks related to the realization of UAV flights, and subsequent processing and analysis of the registered images. Students report that PBL is more engaging and allows them to develop a better understanding of RS.

TI  - Formative Assessment in Project-based Learning: Supporting Alternative on the Learning Outcome of Biology Students in University
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOLOGY AND APPLIED SCIENCE (ICOBAS)
AB  - The learning process in higher education is defined as active learning. Nonetheless, there are many learning practices that are oriented only toward mastering the cognitive aspect and only assess the cognitive aspect via paper and pencil test. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of formative assessment in project-based learning on the learning outcome of Biology Students. This study adopted a quasi-experimental pre-test and post-test control group design to examine the effect of formative assessment on the learning outcome. The samples were 120 Biology Education students from Universitas Negeri Malang and divided into two learning groups. The first learning group as control class and the second as experiment class. The instruments used to measure cognitive learning outcomes were 15 multiple choice questions and 5 essay questions. Data analyses were descriptive analysis and Covariate analysis. The results of the Covariate Analysis test calculations can be seen that F count is 17.456 and the probability value of the learning model is 0,000 or less than 0.05. Formative assessment such as information literacy rubric is needed by students in helping the learning process of Biology students in higher education.

TI  - Investigating the impact of teacher practices and noncognitive factors on mathematics achievement
T2  - RESEARCH IN EDUCATION
AB  - It is with increasing importance that mathematics education research considers the role of noncognitive motivation variables alongside elements of the classroom context in investigations of student mathematics performance. This study uses a hierarchical linear modeling framework to predict mathematics achievement from three classroom variables, project-based learning, group collaboration, and student-driven curriculum, and two noncognitive factors, mathematics anxiety and mathematics self-concept, utilizing data from the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) United States sample. Findings suggest that mathematics classroom contexts that are student-driven and integrate project-based learning positively impact mathematics achievement, and that both mathematics anxiety and mathematics self-concept contribute significantly towards explaining variation in mathematics achievement after accounting for gender, race, socioeconomic status, truancy, and school-level poverty.

TI  - ENHANCING SCIENCE TEACHERS' SCIENCE PROCESS SKILLS USING TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN INTERDISCIPLINARY PROJECT-BASED LEARNING
T2  - INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS
AB  - Recognizing the necessity for robust Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programs, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) recommended such initiatives in light of the 2022 results to improve the quality of science education. This study responds to that need by assessing the effectiveness of a CPD program aimed at technology-driven, interdisciplinary project-based learning (PBL) to enhance the science process skills of in-service science teachers in the Kashkadardya Region of Uzbekistan. The research employed a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design. The study unfolded in two phases using this design. The quantitative phase involved pre-tests and post-tests, while the qualitative design incorporated phenomenology. Results from the quantitative phase indicated a significant improvement in teachers' science process skills, evidenced by paired t-test results and a notable effect size, confirming the enhancement of these skills. The qualitative findings revealed three primary themes: the seamless integration of scientific practices into PBL, fostering supportive collaboration and teamwork, and the augmented ability of teachers to deliver effective science education. Employing tools like Canva, menti.com, and YouTube within the CPD program proved beneficial for promoting experiential learning, creative engagement, and collaborative problem-solving. These findings emphasize the importance of integrating science process skills within interdisciplinary and inquiry based frameworks that encourage critical thinking and real-world applications. This research underscores the vital importance of CPD in advancing science education and urges policymakers and educational institutions to prioritize such programs. The CPD program can be implemented in other regions of Uzbekistan and around the world to strengthen science teachers' process skills. Various educational institutions can adopt the CPD framework and incorporate it into their future in-service training programs.

TI  - The Community of Inquiry Perspective on Teachers? Role and Students? Evaluations of Online Project-Based Learning
T2  - ONLINE LEARNING
AB  - The role of teachers is an important element of online project-based learning courses. Based on the Community of Inquiry framework, this study examined how students' perceptions of teaching presence, through social presence and cognitive presence, were related to their evaluations of online project-based learning. A 16-week online project-based legal education course was implemented. During the course, students engaged in two small group activities and created two final products. Survey data were collected twice from 38 and 41 students in two course phases. Results from partial least squares analyses revealed that teaching presence was directly related to students' evaluations in the early stage of the course and indirectly related to students' evaluations, through the effects of social presence, in the entire course. Practical implications for teachers and suggestions for further studies are provided.

TI  - Assessment of Students' Creative Thinking Skill on the Implementation of Project-Based Learning
T2  - IJOLE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE EDUCATION
AB  - The implementation of Merdeka Belajar - Kampus Merdeka (Freedom to Learn) in Indonesia urges universities to adapt and set changes in learning activities. One of the changes is the implementation of Project-Based Learning to increase students' activeness and creativity. This research aims to assess students' creative thinking skills on the implementation of Project-Based Learning. This research is a descriptive qualitative case study. Purposive sampling is chosen in this research because the sample is chosen on purpose, i.e., those who join literary criticism class. There are thirty-six students who played as the subject of the research. It uses observation sheets and questionnaires to obtain the data. The data are then analyzed to get reliable results of students' creative thinking assessment. The result shows that half of the students (50%) agree that they face some difficulties in developing their creative thinking. Most of their problems are developing ideas into coherence text, structuring or organizing a good text, and choosing appropriate vocabulary to avoid repetition in the text. Students also find that project-based learning allows them to develop their creative thinking. It can be seen from four main rubrics of creative thinking assessment in form of originality, fluency, flexibility, and elaboration. Regarding the result, it can be concluded that project-based learning is proven to be beneficial in developing students' creative thinking skills, though they find some obstacles during the process.

TI  - The effectiveness of project-based learning on students' academic achievement in emergency nursing study
T2  - HEALTHCARE IN LOW-RESOURCE SETTINGS
AB  - Projects necessitate students to choose and identify constructive models of investigation and materials while employing appropriate strategies for conducting learning activities. However, the effectiveness of such methods in the context of nursing-specific education has not been extensively explored. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of project-based learning in emergency and critical care nursing courses for nursing students. This study employed a pre-experimental design. The research sample consisted of 123 students enrolled in the emergency, critical, and disaster management nursing course at Universitas Jember. The research involved a comparison of students' learning outcomes through written test questions before and after they completed a project. The results of the learning assessment before and after the project intervention were analyzed using the Wilcoxon Test. The results of the bivariate obtained a significance value of 0.0001. The results of this statistical test can be concluded that the project-based learning method is effective in increasing the knowledge of emergency, critical and disaster nursing. The project-based learning method proves to be effective in enhancing students' comprehension of emergency, critical, and disaster nursing. Nursing educational institutions can consider the incorporation of this method in curriculum design to create more effective learning strategies. It serves as a promising alternative for enhancing the quality of nursing education. Further research is necessary to validate these findings and investigate various factors that may influence the effectiveness of project-based learning methods in the nursing context.

TI  - Project-based learning methodology in the area of microbiology applied to undergraduate medical research
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - In the recent years, there has been a decrease in the number of medical professionals dedicated to a research career. There is evidence that students with a research experience during their training acquire knowledge and skills that increase the probability of getting involved in research more successfully. In the Degree of Medicine (University of the Basque Country) the annual core subject 'Research Project' introduces students to research. The aim of this work was to implement a project-based learning methodology, with the students working on microbiology, and to analyse its result along time. Given an initial scenario, the students had to come up with a research idea related to medical microbiology and to carry out a research project, including writing a funding proposal, developing the experimental assays and analyzing and presenting their results to a congress organized by the University. Summative assessment was performed by both students and teachers. A satisfaction survey was carried out to gather the students' opinion. The overall results regarding to the classroom dynamics, learning results and motivation after the implementation were favourable. Students referred a greater interest about research than they had before. They would choose the project based methodology versus the traditional one.

TI  - CONTROL THEORY PRACTICES APPLIED TO TEACHING PRACTICAL CONTROL THEORY
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION, 2017, VOL 5
AB  - Control theory is useful in a broad range of diverse applications that include mechanical, electrical and chemical systems. This work extends the application of control theory from achieving a desired technical outcome to achieving a desired pedagogical outcome. In this paper, the desired outcome is the teaching and learning of applied control systems theory. In the proposed model, the student is the plant, their skill set is the set point, the instructor is the controller, and either an exardor a project-based-learning (PBL) course is the sensor. The PBL course is used to evaluate the actual skill set of the students and the difference between the actual and desired skill set (error signal) is fed back to the professor to initiate curricular changes. This model is shown to be applicable at various levels. At the micro level, examinations within a course are used to optimize that course. At the intermediate level, a PBL course is used as the sensor for a conventional lecture-based course. At the macro level, the departmental program as a whole is matched to the needs of industry in pursuit of a 100% employment rate of its students.

TI  - Leadership Growth Over Multiple Semesters in Project-Based Student Teams Embedded in Faculty Research (Vertically Integrated Projects)
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
AB  - Contribution: This longitudinal study modeled student leadership growth in a course sequence supporting long-term, large-scale, multidisciplinary projects embedded in faculty research. Students (half from computer science, computational media, electrical engineering, and computer engineering) participated for 1-4 semesters.Background: PBL is used widely in higher education. It is used in industry for leadership development, but leadership development in project-based learning (PBL) has not been explored in higher education. A preliminary analysis implied leadership growth through the third semester of participation, but the design did not control for attrition.Research Questions: At the student level, how do leadership role ratings change over multiple semesters of participation? Do first (and second) semester ratings differ by number of semesters students eventually participate?Methodology: The study involved two peer evaluation questions on 1) the degree to which students coordinated the team's work and 2) served as technical/content area leaders. Analysis employed analysis of variance to examine attrition by initial ratings (N = 1045) and multilevel growth modeling to study change over time (N = 585). A strength of using peer evaluations is the large sample size, but a weakness is that the tool was developed for student assessment and not educational research. The study did not control for participation in leadership programs outside the course.Findings: On average, individual leadership role ratings increased each semester through the third semester of participation. Ratings of students who left the program after 1 or 2 semesters did not differ from ratings for those who participated longer.

TI  - Promoting Authentic Student Assessment for STEM Project-Based Learning Activities
T2  - INTERNET OF THINGS, INFRASTRUCTURES AND MOBILE APPLICATIONS
AB  - This paper is a case study which discusses the development and the use of rubrics as means of assessing students in STEM project-based learning activities. The context of the case study involves the pilot phase of the STEMFREAK program, an out-of-school educational program which engaged students in such projects. The aim of the paper is twofold: 1) to present the systematic process that was employed for the design, development and application of rubrics and 2) to assess the effectiveness of the STEMFREAK program which, following the principle of constructive alignment between learning design and assessment strategy, was designed to develop the students' competencies that the rubrics assess. The design and the development of the rubrics took place following an iterative and participatory approach, whereas their application engaged 15 students in STEM projects. The students were assessed using the ensuing rubrics in a pre-post single group research design. The results showed that all students made statistically significant progress in all aspects of their performance, as assessed by the rubrics made. The case study has the potential of informing future approaches towards the assessment of students in projects that cater for STEM project-based learning with young learners.

TI  - Examining the Impact of Project-Based Learning on Students' Self-Reported and Actual Learning Outcomes
T2  - PEDAGOGY IN HEALTH PROMOTION
AB  - Active, collaborative, and project-based learning strategies have become increasingly popular in college classrooms due to their effectiveness in cultivating student-centered learning. Compared to conventional teaching methods, active and project-based learning engages students in the learning process by fostering collaborative approaches to addressing real-world problems. To better prepare students for future careers in health promotion, we evaluated the effectiveness of a collaborative project-based health promotion assignment on self-perceived and actual learning among a sample of underrepresented students (N = 33). In order to assess learning, students completed both a self-reported and actual learning assessment designed to assess competency of the core learning outcomes of the health promotion course. Results demonstrated approximately similar increases in self-reported and actual learning over the semester. Although the results were unexpectedly parallel, students consistently underestimated their knowledge on both the pre- and post-learning assessments. In all, survey results demonstrated the group-based project served as a valuable tool for undergraduate learning, with the majority of students evaluating the project positively across all measures.

TI  - Managing PBL Difficulties in an Industrial Engineering and Management Program
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-JIEM
AB  - Purpose: Project-Based Learning (PBL) is considered to be an active learning methodology which can be used to develop both technical and transversal competences in engineering programs. This methodology demands a great deal of work effort from the students and also from the teachers and it requires a meticulous plan and a well-managed project as well. These activities go far beyond the normal activities in traditional lectures, enabling to outpace the difficulties that spur along the way that may be both complex and demotivating. This methodology has been implemented in the Integrated Master Degree on Industrial Engineering and Management (IEM), at one public university in Portugal, since the 2004/2005 academic year. The aim of this paper is to identify and discuss the main difficulties of the implementation of PBL, mainly from the teachers' perspectives. Additionally, some effective strategies will be recommended to overcome such difficulties.

TI  - Evaluation of the CTMTC Methodology for Assessment of Teamwork Competence Development and Acquisition in Higher Education
T2  - LEARNING AND COLLABORATION TECHNOLOGIES, LCT 2016
AB  - The majority of tasks and processes at the workplace involve the collaboration of two or more people, which explains that teamwork competence acquisition has become a priority for educational institutions. In project-based learning, student assessment is complex and generally focuses on the final outcome delivered by the group, without paying attention to the contribution of each individual or to the complete process. CTMTC is a methodology that facilitates teamwork competence acquisition and individual and group assessment in collaborative learning. This study describes and evaluates the application of CTMTC for student assessment in group project-based learning in Higher Education. The study also shows a particular case scenario of application of CTMTC and evaluates the benefits derived from the use of CTMTC. The results suggest that the methodology should be tailored to students' needs and course characteristics, and reveal a positive perception from students about the application of the CTMTC methodology.

TI  - The progress test of medicine: the Dutch experience
T2  - PERSPECTIVES ON MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - Progress testing in the Netherlands has a long history. It was first introduced at one medical school which had a problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum from the start. Later, other schools with and without PBL curricula joined. At present, approximately 10,000 students sit a test every three months. The annual progress exam is not a single test. It consists of a series of 4 tests per annum which are summative in the end. The current situation with emphasis on the formative and summative aspects will be discussed. The reader will get insight into the way progress testing can be used as feedback for students and schools.

TI  - DEVELOPMENT OF A SPEECH CONTROLLED ROBOT IN AN ENGINEERING DESIGN CLASS
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION, 2015, VOL 5
AB  - Project based learning (PBL) is a dynamic classroom approach in which students actively explore solving real world problems and gaining knowledge and skills through developing real products. In this paper, we introduce a student project that focuses on the integration of mechanical and electrical components in the development of a speech controlled service robot. The technical details of this project are presented, including the major components, system integration, and the software that enables the functions of the robot. A robot with such functions can be used in many applications such as military operations, speech controlled appliances, etc. Student assessment has shown that this project helps students learn valuable knowledge of product development that are usually only acquired through real world working experiences.

TI  - Multivariate Analysis of Students Perception on Teaching with Client Based and Non-Client Based Team Projects
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING PEDAGOGY
AB  - The classroom experience has evolved from traditional lecture, PowerPoint and whiteboards to a more active environment where students and instructors work together on hands-on activities to achieve the course objectives. Various names have been given to this pedagogy; experiential learning, project based learning (client based versus non-client based), active learning, and problem based learning are a handful of names used to describe this evolving pedagogy. The main challenge faced by educators in educating undergraduate students to be independent thinkers and problem solvers has been the driving force fueling the shift in pedagogy. This research looks into student's perception on project based learning with client based and non-client based projects in terms of: the project as a learning device, contribution to research knowledge, motivation to learn, contribution to skills and personal benefits, and their effects on student evaluation of teaching and motivation to learn. From the study, both project types motivate students, but, the non-client based had a higher statistically significant mean than the client based projects.

TI  - Proposal for hybridization of Cooperative Learning and Project-Based Learning in Secondary School, through strength training and according to SDG 3 (Health and Well-being)
T2  - RETOS-NUEVAS TENDENCIAS EN EDUCACION FISICA DEPORTE Y RECREACION
AB  - The aim of this work was to present the proposal carried out in Physical Education through the hybridization of two innovative methodologies, Cooperative Learning and Project Based Learning, through the education of strength training in order to enhance the Sustainable Development Goal "Health and Well-being" (SDG 3) and qualitatively assess the experience of students. The proposal called "Strength X Health" consisted of 12 sessions for students in the third year of secondary school, which were aimed at improving their autonomy and health, using strength training as the main axis and concluding with the achievement of a final project where everything learned was compiled. The most outstanding results highlighted the positive evaluation by the students of the "Strength x Health" proposal, the involvement of the students in cooperative work for the development of a common project and the acquisition of proposals for strength training. Improvements in physical condition were observed, and the importance of promoting physical activity and the understanding of healthy habits from an early age was emphasized. In conclusion, this study offers an innovative proposal to promote health and wellbeing in secondary school students through physical education, supported by the fulfillment of sustainable development objectives.

TI  - Testing the "Grandma Hypothesis": Characterizing Skin Microbiome Diversity as a Project-Based Learning Approach to Genomics
T2  - JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
AB  - The constantly evolving nature of genomics provides new challenges for students in Public Health as they try to understand how genomic information relates to health and disease. As Public Health curricula attempt to keep pace with the most recent advances in genomics, students should gain experience with analyzing genomic data and applying genomic tools to the study of health-related issues. To advance undergraduate and graduate student education and provide a more comprehensive view of genomics, we developed an educational project including both pedagogic and research components to characterize skin microbial communities (microbiomes) using targeted amplicon sequencing of their genomes (metataxonomy). All students completed the lab procedures, analyzed 16S rRNA genomic data (formative assessments), and wrote a five-page scientific report summarizing and discussing their results (summative assessment). Student grades for the summative assessment ranged from 31.5 to 40 (out of 40) points. They also successfully completed two practicums (problem sets) focused on microbiome sequence data and responded to 12 minute-papers related to genomic topics covered in class. In all these exercises the 2019 students outperformed 2018 students, who did not participate in this educational lab project. By fulfilling all the requirements of this project-based learning experience, students better understood the complexity of genomics and acquired a valuable set of marketable experience and skills in molecular technologies, bioinformatics and statistics (quantitative skills). Additionally, students were able to generate new valuable microbial 16S rRNA genomic data and test hypotheses about the composition and diversity of the microbes living on our skin (microbiota).

TI  - Hybridization of pedagogical models through acrosport. A proposal for a learning situation for Secondary Education students
T2  - RETOS-NUEVAS TENDENCIAS EN EDUCACION FISICA DEPORTE Y RECREACION
AB  - The lack of training for Physical Education teachers and the infrequent use of active methodologies are two reasons why some students in Secondary Education have negative attitudes toward artistic activities. The aim of this study was to describe a Learning Situation on acrosport with the assistance of a hybridization of pedagogical models, including Cooperative Learning, Formative and Shared Assessment, and Project-Based Learning, as well as to analyze its effect on learning. To do this, a total of 78 4th-year students, 41 girls (53%) and 37 boys (47%), aged between 15 and 17, participated. The three course groups (A, B and C) carried out different activities, divided into mixed teams over 10 sessions to cooperatively develop an acrosport exercise and formatively evaluate it. The results showed a significant correlation between the scores in the various instruments used to assess the two evaluation criteria, obtain-ing good results in both. It is concluded that the intervention through this hybrid model generates positive effects on the teaching -learning process.

TI  - An Embedded Systems Course for Engineering Students Using Open-Source Platforms in Wireless Scenarios
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
AB  - This paper presents a case study analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of using project-based learning (PBL) combined with collaborative learning (CL) and industry best practices, integrated with information communication technologies, open-source software, and open-source hardware tools, in a specialized microcontroller and embedded systems engineering Master's course. In addition to addressing industry requirements in both contents and methodology, the course develops capabilities and competencies in problem solving, independent learning, teamwork, and technical knowledge. Since PBL methodology alone does not ensure teamwork, it was complemented with CL. Design review meetings (as described in IEC 61160), deliverables, and organizational resources were also introduced to mirror industry demands. This structure integrated course content and student academic achievement in a simulated industrial environment. The course had students build a modular management system for home appliances, implementing control software on the "Arduino" open-source platform, as well as using wireless communications. The results show that teaching, learning, and student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL with CL. In addition, the introduction of industry practices, such us peer review meetings, brings academia closer to a real-world context.

TI  - The effect of using a project-based learning (PBL) approach to improve engineering students' understanding of statistics
T2  - TEACHING MATHEMATICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB  - Over the last number of years we have gradually been introducing a project based learning approach to the teaching of engineering mathematics in Dublin Institute of Technology. Several projects are now in existence for the teaching of both second-order differential equations and first order differential equations. We intend to incrementally extend this approach across more of the engineering mathematics curriculum. As part of this ongoing process, practical real world projects in statistics were incorporated into a second year ordinary degree mathematics module. This paper provides an overview of these projects and their implementation. As a means to measure the success of this initiative, we used the SALG instrument to gain feedback from the students. The SALG online tool - Student Assessment of their Learning Gains https://salgsite.net/; is a free course-evaluation tool that enables third-level educators to gather feedback specifically focused on what the students gained through the learning exercise they experience. It can be used to measure students' learning gains. Pre-developed surveys are available which can be modified and are stored in a repository for ease of access. Results are anonymous and there is the ability to download comments and basic statistical analysis of responses. Feedback from the survey points to a large increase in understanding of the material coupled with an increase in confidence. In addition we outline some of the limitations of our initial implementation of this approach and what we hope to improve on for the next academic year.

TI  - Transforming Tomorrow: A Practical Synthesis of STEAM and PBL for Empowering Students' Creative Thinking
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION
AB  - This study investigates the integration of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) and PBL (Project-based Learning) into pedagogical practice and investigates their impact on students' creative thinking. This research examines how a single case school integrates diverse educational objectives and technologies within a Tri-Phase STEAM PBL (TPSP) course. Using a quasi-experimental methodology, an 18-week TPSP course was implemented in an experimental group of 27 sixth-grade students. This group was contrasted with a control group of 56 students who received standard lecture-based education. To ensure consistency in education delivery, the experimental and control groups were taught by the same cohort of teachers. The PISA-based (Program for International Student Assessment) Creative Thinking Test was used as the research instrument to evaluate the differences in creative thinking between the experimental and comparison groups. Evidence indicated that students in the experimental group with STEAM PBL outperformed their peers in the comparison group in both overall social and scientific creative thinking. Specifically, the experimental group students' ability to generate diverse ideas (GD), generate creative ideas (GC), and evaluate and improve others' ideas (EI) were significantly improved. The experimental group students can think faster and divergently (GD) and develop unique and original ideas for problem-solving (GC). The student's ability to understand, evaluate, and improve others' ideas or products was also enhanced (EI). Evidence indicated that a well-structured TPSP can be used as a feasible and practical approach to improving students' creative thinking.

TI  - Project-Based Learning and Evaluation in an Online Digital Design Course
T2  - ELECTRONICS
AB  - This paper reports an experience of an abrupt shift from traditional teaching to distance learning within a course on digital system design using programmable logic platforms. The course organization and evaluation model had to be modified on the fly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The adopted teaching and assessment methodology puts a strong focus on the laboratory component, assigning a very significant weight to project-based evaluation. As the access to laboratory equipment was cut, all the previously accumulated experience had to be modified and adapted to new circumstances. The paper discusses teaching methods employed within the course and analyzes in detail a project-based evaluation accentuated on modeling of a simplified processor. The advantages and drawbacks of the reported teaching methods are appointed. Possible design extensions are also suggested, which permit assigning the same core project to different students. We believe that the proposed project is a valuable instructional tool, in particular, for remote learning/assessment.

TI  - How Does Flipped Learning Work? A Case Study in Signals and Systems Teaching
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - Student-centered teaching approaches emphasize student responsibility and learning. Flipped learning is a student-centered approach to promoting student learning. In this paper, we describe a flipped learning strategy that involves fostering collaborative, problem-based, and project-based learning in engineering courses. In addition, we delineate the role of student assessment and teacher-student interactions in the flipped learning teaching strategy. In this study, we compare academic achievement and student perceptions of instruction in a lecture-based and a flipped classroom. The results show that the students in a flipped classroom had higher grades than those in a lecture-based classroom. In addition, students in the flipped classroom assessed the learning materials, activities, and evaluations more positively than the students in the lecture-based classroom did. Students in the flipped classroom were also found to be more likely than those in the other class to perceive that they could apply the knowledge and skills they developed in the course. They also had higher motivation to learn than the students in the lecture-based class and perceived that the instructor generated a positive climate that fostered student participation.

TI  - TRANSLATION PROJECT AS AN ASSESSMENT TOOL: UKRAINIAN CONTEXT
T2  - JOURNAL OF TEACHING ENGLISH FOR SPECIFIC AND ACADEMIC PURPOSES
AB  - The given paper focuses on the analysis of a translation project as a powerful assessment tool that can be easily integrated into prospective philologists' university training in order to enhance its quality and bring its outcomes into line with global industrial needs and requirements. With this aim, substantial translation pedagogy experience of project-based learning is consolidated from the viewpoint of action-oriented, student-centered, situated, experiential and reflective approaches. Translation project properties, design features, role and function distribution peculiarities typical for global professional environment are considered. The received findings are transferred and adjusted to the current terms and conditions of prospective philologists' training in Ukrainian higher educational setting. As a result, a working classification of translation project varieties to be developed and implemented into training process at different training stages is suggested. Their functions and potential usage as a flexible assessment framework is specified. The translation project opportunity for the arrangement of not only formative but summative assessment as well is substantiated due to its contrasting to the existing examination practices. Finally, the idea of cross-assessment as the complex assessment procedure conducted from different perspectives (hetero, self-and peer-assessment) with the help of versatile tools and instruments (incorporated into single flexible translation project) is introduced.

TI  - Impact of a PBL-Based Professional Learning Program in Denmark on the Development of the Beliefs and Practices of Chinese STEM University Teachers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
AB  - This study investigated 35 Chinese university teachers' development of learner-centered beliefs and practices through a six-month problem and project-based (PBL) professional learning program in Denmark using a mixed-method research. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the participants' teaching and learning portfolios, which each included six entries, identified a significant change in their beliefs, from teacher-centered domination at the program's start to more learner-centered beliefs by the end (Nine teachers held learner-centered beliefs, seventeen teachers held dual beliefs and nine teachers still held teacher-centered beliefs.). Survey analysis identified a significant change in participants' intended practices at the end of the program. Participants reported a significant increase in using classroom interactions and formative assessment and a significant decrease in using summative assessment, yet content delivery remained the focus of their practices. A significant correlation was identified between participants' beliefs and practices at the program's end, which was not found at the program's start. The results indicate a noteworthy impact of the PBL-based professional learning program on the participants' changes in beliefs and practices, and an association between beliefs and practices was found. However, systemic, individual and cultural factors may constrain changes in teaching practices.

TI  - Sustainable assessment of learning experiences based on projects
T2  - EDUCATION IN THE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY
AB  - In a project-based learning experience, the detailed monitoring of the activities in which team members participate can be useful to evaluate their work. Using learning-oriented assessment procedures, supervisors can assess the teamwork abilities with a formative purpose. Evaluation strategies such as self-assessment, peer assessment and co-assessment are often used to make evaluation formative and sustainable. Conducting an assessment strategy is not easy for team members, since they need before to have a reasonable understanding of the evaluation process and criteria. This paper describes a learning-oriented evaluation methodology and an open data framework that can be applied to collaborative project settings. An evaluation rubric and a series of indicators that provide evidences about the developed skills have been elaborated and applied in a small-scale project-based course. Projects were managed and developed with the help of an open source software forge that contains a ticketing tool for planning and tracking of tasks, a version control repository to save the software outcomes, and using a wiki to host text deliverables. The experience provides evidences in favor of using the assessment method and open data framework to make teamwork evaluation more sustainable.

TI  - Re-Engineering of Undergraduate Analogue Electronics Laboratories during Covid-19
T2  - 2022 33RD IRISH SIGNALS AND SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (ISSC)
AB  - The coronavirus pandemic that spread throughout the world during 2020 and 2021 caused enormous upheavals in workplaces and educational settings. Most educational establishments were forced to rapidly switch to online methods of course delivery and student assessment, which presented a challenge to programmes with practical laboratories and project-based learning. This paper presents the approaches that were taken to mitigate the effects of Covid-19 on the practical laboratories for two analogue circuit design modules at University College Cork (UCC). The practical learning outcomes for these modules were facilitated by use of ADALM2000 Active Learning Modules combined with small modifications to make the best use of the kits.

T2  - 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PHYSICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS (ICOPIA)
AB  - This research aims to: 1) Identification of activity steps in project learning that can be recorded by video to facilitate formative assessment, and 2) Design a Self-Regulated Project Based Learning (SRPjBL) model to improve competences of Indonesian physics teacher candidates. The research method is done through two phases: 1) Study of literatures on video recording advantages in PjBL, and 2) Propose SRPjBL model to improve competences of physics teacher candidates through video recording based evaluation. The results show that the main phase of project learning is the inquiry activities to create new products. The activities are as follows: Problems challenging, preparing, planning, performing, and Evaluating. The process in each activity is integrated with self-regulation to improve competences of teacher candidates. Competencies are as follows: professional, pedagogic, personal, and social. Assessment of activities and products is easier by video documentation. In the future, this model can be used to explore competences of professional, pedagogy, and social of physics teacher candidates.

TI  - Formative assessment scores in tutorial sessions correlates with OSCE and progress testing scores in a PBL medical curriculum
T2  - MEDICAL EDUCATION ONLINE
AB  - Background: Effective assessments programs are a challenge in problem-based learning (PBL). One of the main principles of this educational setting is the Formative Assessment (FA). We hypothesized that students' performance assessed by FA in tutorial sessions in a PBL curriculum is related to other summative assessments. Objective: To investigate the correlation among FA in tutorial sessions with grades obtained in Objective Structured Clinical Evaluation (OSCE) and Progress Testing (PT) to better understand the assessment process in PBL medical teaching approach and to predict student's future performance. Design: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted comparing FA, OSCE and PT scores from 4th to 8th semester medical students. Correlation analyses were performed using pooled and separate data from the 4th and 8th semesters. Results: From the 5th to 8th semester, OSCE scores were smaller compared to the FA, while PT scores were lower in all stages. In the pooled data, the correlation analysis showed a significant positive relationship between grades on FA and OSCE, FA and PT and OSCE and PT. A significant correlation among the three assessments strategies was also detected in the 8(th) semester, but not in the 4th semester. Conclusions: Assessment strategies in PBL approach, including FA, OSCE and PT, have positive correlations, which increases as the medical course becomes more complex.

TI  - Toward Knowledge-in-use with the Core Idea of Adaptation: Evaluating Unit Formative Assessment for Elementary Students' Scientific Practices and Knowledge
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION
AB  - To address the demand for designing and evaluating a knowledge-in-use assessment in the elementary, this study evaluates the validity, reliability, and fairness of a post-unit assessment (squirrels assessment) for core ideas related to Ecosystem Dynamics and Adaptation. This study provides evidence for designing and developing a valid 3D learning assessment to measure knowledge-in-use (e.g., recognizing environment changes, cause and effect, modeling/explaining adaptation, sense of community) with psychometric properties and fairness in the classroom. Participants are 682 children in 43 classrooms. Leveraging Item Response Theory, Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Differential Item Function, we examine the validity and fairness of measurement and the intended assessment construct of knowledge-in-use. Results suggest that the two-parameter Grade Response Model and CFA analyses support the psychometric properties and construct validity. Differential item functioning analysis (DIF) and testing invariance between student characteristics (gender, urban/non-urban, white/non-white, English language learners (ELL) status, reading level, age) are also evaluated. Results show that high-quality project-based Learning environmental design and assessment supported fairness across gender, age, and reading performance. In contrast, some items still favor White students over the Black, Hispanic, multiracial and students labeled ELL. Future research needs to consider potential bias toward race and ethnicity, local knowledge, and linguistic background, even in highly social science learning environments.

TI  - Student evaluation of a virtual experience for project management learning: An empirical study for learning improvement
T2  - COMPUTERS & EDUCATION
AB  - Project management education was designed traditionally according to an expository paradigm. However, it needs to be redefined to engage students in higher order thinking and to facilitate effective learning. This study proposes a student-centered approach that is aligned with situated learning theory in virtual teams and explores its impact on student satisfaction and learning outcomes. Using a quasi-experimental design, 122 undergraduate and master's degree students enrolled in project management courses at two universities in separate locations. They were separated randomly into two groups, an experimental group in which students used the proposed student-centered approach and a control group in which students followed a more traditional course design. Data analysis indicated a higher level of satisfaction and performance with the proposed methodology. These results suggest that the presented methodology, which was based on project-based learning in an authentic context that offers opportunities for students to experience virtual teamwork, was more effective than traditional teaching approaches. Furthermore, there were some positive and significant correlations between students' satisfaction and their final marks. In this matter, the most relevant aspects to facilitate students' academic performance were (1) positive expectations of future professional development, (2) clear learning objectives that consistently relate to the content of the course, (3) positive feelings induced by teachers' support in resolving doubts, and (4) academic self-perception. The findings of this study suggest that motivational and affective states influence student learning in higher education. This is consistent with current learning theories. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES FOR SUPPORTING THE UNDERGRADUATE OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING TEACHING PROCESS: A SCOPING REVIEW
T2  - 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES (EDULEARN17)
AB  - Computer Science degree students commonly have a high failure rate in object-oriented programming (OOP). To reduce the failure rate is needed that teachers use techniques to motivate and help students in keep their focus attention; to help students to organize their information for understanding and remembering, and to enable teachers to monitor and assess their learning. These techniques are called instructional strategies. In this paper, we present a scoping review of to answer the research question: What are the instructional strategies that have been most successful use for teaching object-oriented programming at the undergraduate level? The review was performed using three electronic databases: SCOPUS, ERIC and JSTOR. Searching period was from 01/01/2006 to 12/31/2016. Our results show some instructional strategies used in object-oriented programming in the last ten years. These are: blended learning, project based learning, object-first, iterative learning, instructional games, formative assessment, educational programming environments, bottom-up and top-down approaches, and interactive visualizations.

TI  - Engineering Education for Sustainable Development: The European Project Semester Approach
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
AB  - Contribution: An analysis of the extent to which sustainability is present in the syllabi, project briefs, report templates, and student final reports of the three Iberian European project semester (EPS) providers, over a five-year period. Background: EPS is a one-semester capstone project framework that adopts project-based learning and multicultural, multidisciplinary teamwork. Educating engineers for sustainable development requires fostering critical and ethical thinking and a desire for equity, solidarity and preservation of natural resources, and cultural and genetic diversity. Existing engineering capstone design programs emphasize solving real world problems, hands-on training, and soft skills, but few focus on sustainability aspects of engineering design. The three Iberian EPS providers adopt project-based learning and teamwork methodologies, promoting the development of transversal skills and addressing sustainability in a multicultural and multidisciplinary background. Intended Outcomes: To show that the three Iberian EPS providers follow these recommendations and contribute to raising students' awareness of sustainable development. Application Design: The proposed sustainability learning assessment method collects evidence from syllabi, project briefs, report templates, and final reports to extract faculty and student perspectives. The sustainability-related terms collected were processed into word cloud format, allowing a simple and intuitive interpretation of students' understanding of sustainability, and in co-occurrence network format, to understand if sustainability has a pervasive or confined presence within the reports. Findings: Iberian EPS faculty and students are aware of the social, economic, and environmental impact of their projects, in terms of quality of life, social responsibility, the use of resources, and environmentally friendly technology.

TI  - The counselling self-efficacy scale for teachers: action research
T2  - EDUCATIONAL ACTION RESEARCH
AB  - The action research describes the process of how the Counselling Self-Efficacy Scale for Teachers (CS-EST) was developed and explores its suitability as a teaching and learning tool using a pilot study of 178 students at Tallinn University, Estonia. The study integrated action research, interdisciplinary project-based learning, scale development and adaptation principles. During six counselling courses the SC-EST has been used both from the third-person perspective of the action researcher to reflect on the learning outcomes of students and from the student's first-person perspective to support reflecting on one's own counselling skills. The study showed that counselling self-efficacy in prospective teachers significantly raised during the courses. The scale can be used as an online self-assessment task in conjunction with reflective journaling during university-level counselling courses, as the study showed that together they form a useful formative assessment tool. The SC-EST seems to be suitable for Estonian and international students, however larger international studies are needed to further validate the scale. I consider the action research as a transformative learning experience in my professional development.

TI  - How we capitalised on casual PBL facilitators' expertise and experience to add value to our medical programme
T2  - MEDICAL TEACHER
AB  - While problem-based learning (PBL) has been widely implemented in medical education, it has been acknowledged to be resource-intensive, particularly in terms of academics' time. In some institutions, such as Bond University (Australia), casual facilitators have been employed (paid hourly) to oversee the PBL tutorials. Apart from considerable experience as PBL facilitators, they also have expertise as allied health professionals or biomedical scientists. Several facilitators have educational qualifications. Recognising that their roles have expanded beyond the PBL tutorial room, we canvassed PBL facilitators in terms of their contributions to Bond University's medical programme. We can report that our facilitators have contributed to the renewal of Bond's medical programme, from design (e.g. curriculum structure, case-writing) to PBL case reviews. They are also involved in formative and summative assessment. Facilitators identified that, because of their prolonged involvement with the students in small groups, they consider themselves more than facilitators of student learning. They are role models and personal guides. Recognising the value these casually employed facilitators have added to our medical programme, we will continue to develop their skills in, for example, reviewing cases and assessment. We recommend that if institutions do employ casual facilitators, their expertise and experience can add value to the curriculum and to students' experience.

TI  - Students' Perceptions of Best and Worst Aspects of Design Courses: A Qualitative Analysis of 87 Courses and 5591 Students
T2  - 2018 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE)
AB  - This Full Paper presents the results of qualitative analysis of students' perceptions of the best and worst aspects of 87 courses related to design such as engineering design, product design, biomedical engineering innovation and design, and Mechanics-Based Design. The total enrollment in the courses was 5591 students at a Research-Intensive University in the US. Iterative close readings of the comments and open and axial coding were applied to the comments to generate codes that represent students' comments. Codes were grouped in categories that represent students' opinions about teaching. Students reported the best and worst aspects of design courses related to the following categories: course planning and logistics, teaching strategies, learning experiences, assessment and evaluation, mentoring and modeling, and encouragement and motivation. This work suggests that careful design of all aspects of teaching is important. Special attention should be given to aspects of design courses such as project-based learning, teamwork, and hands-on applied learning.

TI  - Teaching bioinformatics through the analysis of SARS-CoV-2: project-based training for computer science students
T2  - BIOINFORMATICS
AB  - Motivation We learn more effectively through experience and reflection than through passive reception of information. Bioinformatics offers an excellent opportunity for project-based learning. Molecular data are abundant and accessible in open repositories, and important concepts in biology can be rediscovered by reanalyzing the data.Results In the manuscript, we report on five hands-on assignments we designed for master's computer science students to train them in bioinformatics for genomics. These assignments are the cornerstones of our introductory bioinformatics course and are centered around the study of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). They assume no prior knowledge of molecular biology but do require programming skills. Through these assignments, students learn about genomes and genes, discover their composition and function, relate SARS-CoV-2 to other viruses, and learn about the body's response to infection. Student evaluation of the assignments confirms their usefulness and value, their appropriate mastery-level difficulty, and their interesting and motivating storyline.Availability and Implementation The course materials are freely available on GitHub at https://github.com/IB-ULFRI.

TI  - Problem-based learning in laboratory medicine resident education: a satisfaction survey
T2  - ANNALES DE BIOLOGIE CLINIQUE
AB  - Theoretical knowledge in biology and medicine plays a substantial role in laboratory medicine resident education. In this study, we assessed the contribution of problem-based learning (PBL) to improve the training of laboratory medicine residents during their internship in the department of virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, France. We compared the residents' satisfaction regarding an educational program based on PBL and a program based on lectures and presentations. PBL induced a high level of satisfaction (100%) among residents compared to lectures and presentations (53%). The main advantages of this technique were to create a situational interest regarding virological problems, to boost the residents' motivation and to help them identify the most relevant learning objectives in virology. However, it appears pertinent to educate the residents in appropriate bibliographic research techniques prior to PBL use and to monitor their learning by regular formative assessment sessions.

TI  - Assessing the Effectiveness of Problem-Based Learning Across Two Concrete Construction Courses
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INSTRUCTION
AB  - The goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) pedagogy that was implemented in two different concrete construction courses. Both courses are a part of an industry focused four-year undergraduate concrete degree program. One of the classes focused on concrete problems, diagnosis, and repair of existing concrete, while the other class focused on handling and management methods of various concrete mixtures. In both courses, a PBL pedagogy was implemented such that students were self-learning and discovering the knowledge through an action-research case study. The action-research case study was specific to the course outcomes relevant to each course, but were assessed similarly. A total of eight different assessment methods were implemented across both courses' multiple times from 2012 - 2019. The results showed that the students are highly benefiting from the PBL pedagogy, which was indicated across all assessment methods. Each assessment technique provided a unique insight into student comprehension or benefits of the PBL pedagogy. The most beneficial assessment techniques were; pre- and post-student assessment, level of understanding and confidence, pre- and post-objective student assessment, and report assessment. These four assessment techniques provide both direct (objective) and indirect (subjective) assessment, while only requiring four total surveys.

TI  - Monitoring the Student Progress in PBL: A Proposal Based on Authentic Assessment and Visual Board
T2  - 2019 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE 2019)
AB  - This Research to Practice Full Paper presents a proposal for monitoring student progress in Problem-Based Learning (PBL). The adoption of the PBL approach has been growing in computer education, where problem-solving and group work are essential. Despite the compatibility and benefits of PBL, some challenges remain, in particular, with respect to the assessment process. For an effective assessment process, it needs to be well defined and managed by both teachers and students themselves, considering that, in PBL, the students are at the center of the teaching and learning process, they are active, and self-regulating. In this context, this paper proposes an interface for student progress monitoring (a "student board") based on an authentic assessment model called PBL-SEE. Constructed using the Design Science Research (DSR) method, this interface was initially prototyped and validated by PBL specialists. The results showed a good acceptance of the student hoard and important recommendations for improvements.

TI  - PBL-SEE: An Authentic Assessment Model for PBL-Based Software Engineering Education
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
AB  - The problem-based learning (PBL) approach has been successfully applied to teaching software engineering thanks to its principles of group work, learning by solving real problems, and learning environments that match the market realities. However, the lack of well-defined methodologies and processes for implementing the PBL approach represents a major challenge. The approach requires great flexibility and dynamism from all involved, whether in mapping content, in teacher performance, or laying out the process of how learners should go about solving problems. This paper suggests that management processes can help in implementing PBL throughout its life cycle (planning, implementation, monitoring, and enhancement), and proposes an assessment model called PBL-SEE for use in software engineering education (SEE). Two examples of its use are provided. The results show how the model can be applied and how the resulting information can be used to make the PBL initiatives "authentic," in that they bring the reality of the labor market to the learning environment, while keeping to PBL principles.

TI  - Educational Data Mining and Big Data Framework for e-Learning Environment
T2  - 2016 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RELIABILITY, INFOCOM TECHNOLOGIES AND OPTIMIZATION (TRENDS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS) (ICRITO)
AB  - E-learning data consists of large volume of educational data and available with complex and hybrid data architecture. Capturing of student performances, student evaluation and student's interaction information are one of the challenges faced by the e-learning software users at the time of analysis. Integrating student data along with educational data for analysis needs complex system design framework. New innovations in e-learning also facilitates augmented learning, adaptive learning, web based learning, activity based learning, and project based learning. Education technology interventions using learning management system, content management system, advanced distributed learning; sharable content object reference models and application program interfaces enhanced and extended the e-learning frameworks to a greater horizon. Present technology also ensures transformations of e-learning information without any geographical barriers. These educational and student or user data combined together forms big data architecture under e-learning environment and mining these big data for various requirements or knowledge discoveries needs innovative approaches. This paper identifies and evaluates various e-learning models and associated education technology paradigm. The research further explores and proposes a new framework for big data integrations. The paper also discusses the scope of future research on data mining and role of big data in e-learning environment.

TI  - Supporting Case-Based Reasoning in Pharmacy Through Case Sequencing
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORMATIVE DESIGN IN LEARNING
AB  - Pharmacists are often required to solve ill-structured problems aimed at achieving optimal health outcomes at the patient, population, and institutional levels. Given the complexity of pharmacists' clinical decisions, educators are exploring ways to foster complex problem-solving and higher order thinking in the classroom. One emerging strategy includes problem-based learning (PBL), which asks learners to collaboratively solve ill-structured cases that are representative of the types of problems faced by practitioners. Case-based reasoning argues that understanding and interpretation of a case is incremental and dynamic; that is, the lessons learned from one case might change in view of new experiences and across a case-based curriculum. While much of the literature is focused on how learners solve a single problem, it is unclear how learners construct their knowledge across multiple cases presented in PBL. To address this gap, this study focused on learners' perception of case sequencing and how that design influenced the development of their internal case library. Because we are focused on formative assessment, we used qualitative analysis to understand the nuances of our design and explored its implications for programmatic changes. The feedback from the participants focused on index generation, index prioritization, alignment with prior knowledge, and reflection. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

TI  - Medical Students' Views About Having Different Types of Problem-Based Learning Tutors
T2  - MEDICAL SCIENCE EDUCATOR
AB  - BackgroundAt Norwich Medical School, Year 3 or 4 medical students taking a year out of the 5-year undergraduate MBBS degree to do a master's degree in clinical education worked as near-peer problem-based learning (PBL) tutors for students in Year 2. Peer-assisted learning has been shown to benefit both peer tutors and tutees; in this study, experiences of students with near-peer PBL tutors were compared to students with other types of PBL tutor.MethodsUsing existing student evaluation data, we compared student views about PBL tutor performance, PBL group functioning, and overall satisfaction with PBL learning experience according to whether their PBL tutor/s were (1) a single near-peer tutor (later-year MB BS student), (2) a single staff tutor, (3) multiple staff tutors, or (4) multiple newly qualified doctor tutors.ResultsResults indicated that students' evaluation of tutor performance was more positive for near-peer PBL tutors compared to both groups of staff tutors for most areas evaluated. Additionally, students' evaluation of overall satisfaction with PBL was more positive for near-peer PBL tutors compared to multiple staff tutors. Tutor performance for multiple staff tutors was evaluated less positively compared to both single staff and multiple newly qualified doctor groups. But there were no statistically significant differences between the four groups regarding PBL group functioning.ConclusionNear-peer PBL tutors perform comparably or better to staff PBL tutors in salient measures of tutor performance and group functioning. We conclude that medical students find near-peer PBL tutors to be an acceptable addition to the PBL tutor workforce.

TI  - Electronic portfolio development and narrative reflections in higher education: Part and parcel of the culture?
T2  - EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effective use of the electronic portfolios in the educational context of graduate students in a major research university in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The use of electronic portfolios with university students has many benefits including advancing learning, assessment and evaluation. The electronic portfolio is considered an innovative instructional approach that has not widely been used in the UAE. Forty electronic portfolios were included in the careful analysis of the e-portfolio development, rubric and reflective narratives. Description of best methods on how to develop the e-portfolio in university teaching and learning, along with areas of attainment is presented. A major result indicates a high reliability of the e-portfolio rubric (0.77) with UAE graduate students. Another result indicated that university student effective use of electronic portfolios leads to successful learning and reflective experiences. A key recommendation is that instructors and institutions can effectively utilize e-portfolios to improve learning and assessment, course delivery, and program outcomes. In addition, personalizing learning indicated by several authentic narrative reflections can be another implication of the e-portfolio use at the higher education level to improve self or online learning and project-based learning.

TI  - Teachers' Perceptions of the Digital Transformation of the Classroom through the Use of Tablets: A Study in Spain
T2  - COMUNICAR
AB  - This study examines the transformation of classroom dynamics brought about by the use of tablets for educational purposes. The empirical bases of this study were defined by the "Samsung Smart School" project, which was developed by Samsung and Spain's Ministry of Education during academic year 2014-15, in which teachers and 5th and 6th year students attending 15 primary schools across several Autonomous Communities in Spain were provided with tablets. The research sample comprised 166 teachers. A qualitative analysis strategy was applied by means of: a) non-participant observation, b) focus groups, c) semi-structured interviews with teachers, and d) content analysis of teaching units. These techniques enabled us to extract and examine six dimensions of teaching (educational objective, teaching approach, organization of content and activities, teaching resources, space and time, and learning assessment). Our findings show that teachers tend to apply a transversal approach when using tablets to work on different competencies, focusing more on activities than on content through the use of apps. They reclaim the act of play as part of the learning process, and indicate tablet use encourages project-based learning. To sum up, this study shows that teachers view tablets not only as a technological challenge, but also as an opportunity to rethink their traditional teaching models.

TI  - Escape rooms as formative knowledge assessment: A quasi-experimental study
T2  - NURSE EDUCATION TODAY
AB  - Background: Escape rooms offer an immersive approach to nursing education, serving as versatile tools for assessment and skill development. While research has explored their potential as alternatives to traditional assessments, their role as formative assessment and impact on knowledge retention in nursing education remain largely unexplored, prompting the need for further investigation. Aim: The study aims to explore the impact of escape rooms as formative assessment on first-year nursing students' knowledge retention. Design: We employed a quasi-experimental research design. Settings: Four escape rooms themed around medication, patient safety, low blood sugar, and sepsis were physically set up in a public university located in the southeast U.S. Student teams of two or three went through each room for an alternative formative assessment. Participants: 134 first-year nursing students, in clinical groups, were randomly assigned into an experimental condition and a control condition. Methods: A gameful experience questionnaire developed by Ho<spacing diaeresis>gberg et al. (2019) was adapted, comprising 47 items across six categories. Additionally, a test consisting of seventeen multiple-choice questions was administered online for pre-test, post-test, and retention test. Students' perceptions of their learning experiences were also gathered through an open-ended question, with themes identified from their responses. Results: The paired t-test on GamefulQuest scores revealed a significant difference between escape rooms and traditional assessment methods, with the experimental group showing notably higher levels of accomplishment, guidance, immersion, playfulness, and social experience. No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups on knowledge retention. Student feedback on escape room experiences highlighted entertainment, educational value, collaboration dynamics, and logistical considerations, underscoring the multifaceted nature of these immersive learning environments. Conclusions: Escape rooms promoted students' positive perception of learning experience, but showed no significant advantage over traditional assessment methods in terms of retention, aligning with existing literature on problem-based learning (PBL).

TI  - Problem-Based Learning and Case-Based Learning in Clinical Practical Teaching for Gynecology Residents: A Narrative Review
T2  - ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
AB  - Background: Gynecology residency training necessitates a robust educational framework to cultivate clinical competency, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Traditional lecture-based teaching methods are deficient in fostering active learning and clinical decision-making. Problem-based learning (PBL) and case-based learning (CBL) have emerged as learner-centered approaches that enhance medical education by integrating theoretical knowledge with clinical practice. This review aims to explain the efficacy, implementation frameworks, challenges, and comparative value of PBL and CBL in gynecology residency education, and explores the role of instructional technology integration. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted across PubMed, ERIC, Scopus, Embase, and EBSCO (January 2010- Inclusion criteria encompassed studies on PBL/CBL interventions in gynecology residency with qualitative/quantitative outcomes. Ten articles met the criteria after screening. Results: Both PBL and CBL significantly outperform in enhancing clinical decision-making, differential diagnosis, knowledge retention, procedural planning, and long-term knowledge application. PBL utilizes open-ended problems to cultivate self-directed learning, critical thinking, and collaborative problem-solving (eg, managing complex AUB etiologies). CBL employs structured clinical cases to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, improving diagnostic reasoning and patient management skills. Key implementation frameworks involve careful pre-session preparation, facilitator-guided discussions on authentic cases, and structured feedback. Challenges include significant faculty time for case design/facilitation, resource intensity, and competency assessment. PBL fosters deep theoretical understanding, while CBL excels in clinical skill translation. Integrating both approaches creates a balanced curriculum. Augmenting PBL/CBL with simulation, flipped classrooms, mobile learning, and AI enhances accessibility, personalization, and procedural skill practice. Conclusion: PBL and CBL are transformative pedagogical strategies for gynecology residency training, effectively developing competencies needed for complex clinical practice. Successful implementation requires rigorously designed cases, faculty trained in facilitative guidance, and strategic technology integration. These approaches prepare residents not only as skilled technicians but as adaptable, patient-centered practitioners capable of navigating evolving healthcare challenges. Investment in faculty development and technology-enhanced PBL/CBL models is crucial for advancing gynecologic education globally.

TI  - Didactic Strategies to Promote Competencies in Sustainability
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Higher education is a principal agent for addressing the sustainable development goals proposed by the 2030 Agenda, because of its key mission of knowledge generation, teaching and social innovation for sustainability. In order to achieve this, higher education needs to integrate transversally the values of sustainability in the way of developing the field of management, as well as research, university life and, of course, teaching. This paper focuses on teaching, and more specifically on the didactic strategies considered most relevant for training in sustainability competencies in college students, according to the guidelines commonly accepted by the international academic community. Through collaborative work among experts from six Spanish universities taking part in the EDINSOST project (education and social innovation for sustainability), funded by the Spanish R&D+i Program, in this paper the role of five active learning strategies (service learning, problem-based learning, project-oriented learning, simulation games and case studies) in education for sustainability are reviewed, and a systematic approach of their implementation in higher education settings is presented. The results provide a synthesis of their objectives, foundations, and stages of application (planning, implementation, and learning assessment), which can be used as valuable guidelines for teachers.

TI  - Applicability and performance of convolutional neural networks for the identification of periodontal bone loss in periapical radiographs: a scoping review
T2  - ORAL RADIOLOGY
AB  - The study aimed to review the applicability and performance of various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for the identification of periodontal bone loss (PBL) in digital periapical radiographs achieved through classification, detection, and segmentation approaches. We searched the PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and SCOPUS databases for articles published up to June 2024. After the selection process, a total of 11 studies were included in this review. The reviewed studies demonstrated that CNNs have a significant potential application for automatic identification of PBL on periapical radiographs through classification and segmentation approaches. CNN architectures can be utilized to classify the presence or absence of PBL, the severity or degree of PBL, and PBL area segmentation. CNN showed a promising performance for PBL identification on periapical radiographs. Future research should focus on dataset preparation, proper selection of CNN architecture, and robust performance evaluation to improve the model. Utilizing an optimized CNN architecture is expected to assist dentists by providing accurate and efficient identification of PBL.

TI  - From Struggle to Mastery: AI-Powered Writing Skills in ESL Education
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Featured Application This study offers a practical model for integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools into writing instructions for English as a Second Language (ESL) learners in secondary education. By blending the Writing Workshop Instructional Model (WWIM) with AI-powered platforms such as Grammarly and ChatGPT, the research presents a scalable, classroom-tested approach to enhancing students' academic writing skills. The findings can be directly applied in bilingual and multilingual educational contexts where students struggle with coherence, organization, and writing confidence. Specifically, schools implementing project-based learning and following international curricula (e.g., Cambridge Assessment) can adopt this hybrid model to foster independent, ethical, and critical writing practices among learners. The approach is especially valuable for educators seeking to integrate AI in formative assessment, real-time feedback, and iterative revision cycles within structured pedagogy.Abstract Despite reaching intermediate English proficiency, many bilingual secondary students in Colombia struggle with academic writing due to difficulties in organizing ideas and expressing arguments coherently. To address this issue, this study explores the integration of AI-powered tools-Grammarly and ChatGPT-within the Writing Workshop Instructional Model (WWIM) to enhance students' writing skills. Conducted at a bilingual secondary school, the intervention targeted 10th grade ESL learners and focused on improving grammar accuracy, textual coherence, and organizational structure. Drawing on Galbraith's model of writing as content generation, the study adopted a design-based research methodology, incorporating iterations of implementation, feedback, and refinement. The results indicate that combining WWIM with AI feedback significantly improved students' academic writing performance. Learners reported greater confidence and engagement when revising drafts using automated suggestions. These findings highlight the pedagogical potential of integrating AI tools into writing instructions and offer practical implications for enhancing academic writing curricula in secondary ESL contexts.

TI  - A Multi-Project Evaluation of Engineering Students' Performance for Online PBL: Taking the Sustainable Decision Analysis Course as an Example
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In order to meet the growing demand for engineering professionals who can incorporate sustainable solutions into their work, sustainability courses have been launched in online problem-based learning (PBL) environments through various real-life projects. Nonetheless, the conventional one-off grading approach may fail to capture the intricate variations in students' performance across different projects. To address this problem, a multi-project evaluation framework utilizing the probability exceedance method (PEM) is proposed, which can fuse linguistic evaluation data presented in probability distributions without the need to obtain weights of criteria. In the case study, a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of students majoring in engineering management is conducted within a study group over an online PBL course on sustainable decision analysis. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that consistent scores can be achieved after assigning different values of fuzzy measures to each criterion. This study enables teachers to holistically evaluate students without being bound by rigid numerical standards or strict weighting schemes, thus allowing them to focus on other educational tasks while ensuring effective and reliable results. Moreover, it contributes to educational innovation by introducing a modern and comprehensive approach for engineering student assessment in online PBL, aligning with the evolving needs of educational sustainability in higher education.

TI  - Design and assessment of a hybrid chemical engineering laboratory course with the incorporation of student-centred experiential learning
T2  - EDUCATION FOR CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
AB  - This paper presents a comparative study of the effectiveness of traditional laboratory (TL) and open-ended project-based laboratory (PBL) in a hybrid chemical engineering laboratory course. The two laboratory modules were delivered using corresponding instruction methods, and their effects on intended highlevel learning outcomes and skill development were assessed by means of student performance and a specific Likert-style survey. The results show that the traditional laboratory based on behaviorist learning is both effective and efficient in enhancing knowledge acquisition and improving learning outcomes, particularly for content-intensive lab components, while the project-based laboratory based on constructivist learning, coupled with an authentic design component, is more effective in fulfilling high-level design-related learning outcomes and developing students with high-level engineering skills. The design component in the PBL was found to be the key to motivating students to seek seamless connection between practical design, pilot-scale laboratory, and underlying theories. The results also indicate that the sequential instruction and formative assessment methodology adopted in the PBL have brought about deep learning and high-level student satisfaction. Feedback from the survey could also be very valuable for the design of more effective, efficient, and sustainable learning pedagogy for engineering laboratory courses.

TI  - A comparison of face-to-face and fully online problem-based learning: Student results and staff experiences, 2014-2020
T2  - HEALTH PROMOTION JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
AB  - Issue addressed Problem-based learning (PBL) is a student-directed pedagogy that promotes critical thinking, self-directed learning and communication skills essential for health promotion students and practitioners. This paper reports on student results, student evaluation and staff experience of PBL in the face-to-face and fully online environment in an undergraduate health sciences unit in an Australian university. Methods A single time-point study using quantitative and qualitative administrative student data (2014-2020) and narrative reflection from teaching academics (n = 5) was undertaken. Descriptive, independent t test and bivariate analyses for student results data were conducted; an inductive approach was used to analyse qualitative data and create codes. Results Student sample (n = 472) consisted face-to-face (n = 358, 75.8%) and online (n = 114, 24.2%) enrolments. Final Unit Mark was significantly higher for fully online students compared with face-to-face students in 2018 (P = .007) and 2019 (P = .001). Final Unit Achievement was significantly higher for fully online students compared with face-to-face students in 2018 (P = .017) and 2019 (P = .043). Three themes emerged: The PBL approach; Evolution of PBLs; Student skills and competencies. Discussion PBL allows students to learn through facilitated problem solving and strong collaborative skills. The face-to-face and fully online PBLs improved the student and academic staff experience, while supporting the development of critical thinking and self-directed research. Further, it supported students to develop their core health promotion competencies; and enhanced the online student learning experience. So what? Vital for contemporary, global graduates, the fully online PBL approach allows students to build critical academic and professional skills utilising current information technology relevant for collaborative professional practice.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of the Boundary-Layer Height from Lidar and the Weather Research and Forecasting Model at an Urban Coastal Site in the North-East Iberian Peninsula
T2  - BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY
AB  - We evaluate planetary boundary-layer (PBL) parametrizations in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical model, with three connected objectives: first, for a 16-year period, we use a cluster analysis algorithm of three-day back-trajectories to determine general synoptic flow patterns over Barcelona, Spain arriving at heights of 0.5, 1.5, and 3 km; to represent the lower PBL, upper PBL, and lower free troposphere, respectively. Seven clusters are determined at each arriving altitude. Regional recirculations account for 54 % of the annual total at 0.5 km, especially in summertime. In the second objective, we assess a time-adaptive approach using an extended Kalman filter to estimate PBL height from backscatter lidar returns at 1200 UTC 30 min for 45 individual days during a seven-year period. PBL heights retrieved with this technique are compared with three classic methods used in the literature to estimate PBL height from lidar. The methods are validated against PBL heights calculated from daytime radiosoundings. Lidar and radiosonde estimated PBL heights are classified under objectively-determined synoptic clusters. With the final objective, WRF model-simulated PBL heights are validated against lidar estimates using eight unique PBL schemes as inputs. Evaluation of WRF model-simulated PBL heights are performed under different synoptic situations. Determination coefficients with lidar estimates indicate the non-local assymetric convective model scheme is the most reliable, with the widely-tested local Mellor-Yamada-Janjic scheme showing the weakest correlations with lidar retrievals. Overall, there is a systematic underestimation of PBL height simulated in the WRF model.

TI  - Strengthening the Comprehension Processes in Medical Students: Applying Problem-Based Learning Accompanied by the Reasoning Procedural Map
T2  - INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL OF PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING
AB  - A study was conducted on the cognitive processes involved in the steps of problem-based learning and the way this pedagogical approach is applied in the health sciences. The objective was to understand more deeply the cognitive process related to student comprehension and its connection with the work done when studying a medical discipline through problem-based learning (PBL). A case study was undertaken with a total of 30 students and an interdisciplinary team composed of a physician and two professionals in the field of education. After a video analysis process of face-to-face teamwork on PBL, it was decided to design and use an advanced organizer to systematize and ease the comprehension process while working with problem scenarios. From its initial application, the students were satisfied with its usefulness, and they provided feedback to improve its format and extend its applicability to other disciplines. It was concluded that not only is it possible to integrate hybrid models in problem-based learning, but also to include variants and auxiliary tools that arise from the cognitive demands and the information management needs of the students, thus favoring the study and the preservation of knowledge.

TI  - Application of PBL in ERP Textbook Design and Technical University Students Learning Effectiveness Study
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 IEEE GLOBAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION CONFERENCE (EDUCON 2020)
AB  - In the existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) teaching models for technical University students, the information system based courses are currently dominated in most of the teaching programs and teaching materials, although there are detailed and complete system procedures provided by the system providers, but the learning assessment results is still unsatisfactory. The companies are not satisfied with the ERP practical skills and basic concepts of the graduating students, the skill gap between the schools and workplaces on ERP are still exist. Therefore, the theme of this study is to apply problem-based learning (PBL) as the design spirit of situational case, ERP teaching plan and the compilation of textbooks, to evaluate the effect of PBL methods on ERP courses teaching, and then design suitable teaching materials and curriculum plans for the technical University students. The problem design strategies and examples of PBL-ERP course and textbook are described, and the students' learning effectiveness are evaluated with a pre- and-post test of problem-solving ability inventory (PSAI), where the results show positive ascension in all aspects, especially in the motivation and confidence to solve problems.

TI  - Upskilling of Pharmacy Faculty in an Accredited Institution through Modular Training in Strategic Education Practices with Formative and Summative Assessments
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
AB  - Aim: To study the impact of Modular Faculty training on the attitude of faculty, motivation towards self-directed learning and team learning. Train the faculty on new teaching and learning tools and assessment. Assess the faculty continuously and after the completion of the training and distribute certificates as per the requirements informed in advance. Materials and Methods: Thirty two (32) faculty of an accredited college were enrolled in a 4 credit course consisting of 15 Modules with 60 contact hr workshop based program spread over about 06 months or 01 semester. Each workshop was of 4 to 5 hr face to face interaction, including pre and post-tests, activities, presentations, discussions, reflections, flash card PPT and feedback. Important modules included were how to write good Learning Outcomes, Problem Based Learning (PBL), Blooms taxonomy, Soft skills, Leadership, Quality assurance and Academic advising to name a few. Formative assessment of 60% included Quiz, Assignment and mid module exam and summative assessment consisted of end module exam for 40% with MCQ's and RRE's (Restricted Response Essay). A minimum of 70 % was assigned a C grade, 80% for B grade and 90% and above for A grade. Results: Twenty-seven faculty (27), 84% completed the training and were awarded the certificate at a public function. Participants rated the program as effective, useful and need based. Average age of faculty in Indian pharmacy colleges is 32 to 34 and without any formal training in teaching and learning. Conclusion: Average pretest score in all the training modules was 4.2 and in post-tests the score rose to 9.6, indicating very clearly that training and upskilling was effective and raised the knowledge, skill and attitude of the participants. Institution paid a nominal fee for the training program, assessment and certification. As of now, in India there is no formal, modular and certificate based training imparted to faculty in about 2000 pharmacy colleges. If they are trained and upskilled, they will be able to impart more effective education and thereby transform the teaching and learning process in the pharmacy colleges.

TI  - Combining course- and program-level outcomes assessments through embedded performance assessments at key courses: A proposal based on the experience from a Japanese dental education program
T2  - TUNING JOURNAL FOR HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - This paper addresses how to combine the course- and program-level assessments and presents a new method illustrated by a case of dental education program in Japan. Performance assessments are considered effective for evaluating knowledge integration and higher-order skills, while placing a burden on faculty, hence their feasibility as the program-level assessment is regarded lower than standardized tests or questionnaire surveys. We have developed several performance assessments at the course level, such as Modified Triple Jump for the PBL course. Based on this experience, we propose Pivotal Embedded Performance Assessment (PEPA) as a method for combining assessment at the course and program levels. The method limits the range of performance assessment to key courses directly linked to program goals and placed at the critical juncture points of curriculum, while entrusting the assessment of other courses to expert judgment of individual teachers. PEPA consists of the following procedures: systematization of curriculum and selection of key courses; design and implementation of performance assessments by a faculty team; setting passing criteria with incorporating the function of formative assessment; certifying the completion of the degree program. PEPA thus enables maintaining assessment feasibility and compatibility with a credit system, while ensuring assessment validity and reliability.

TI  - A dynamic performance evaluation model suggestion for performance-based logistics
T2  - KYBERNETES
AB  - Purpose This study proposes a dynamic performance evaluation model to support the material availability of the public institution under performance- based logistics (PBL) and to select the most appropriate service provider. Design/methodology/approach The model consists of four stages. In the first stage, a criteria set to evaluate alternatives is created. In the second stage, the DEA-MTFP index method is applied for performance evaluation of the alternatives by using crisp data. In the third stage, IFS theory is utilized for aggregating decision-maker judgments on alternatives, and in the last stage, the results of both methods are turned into single value, and it is selected as the most suitable alternative. Findings It is verified that the proposed approach can be implemented to the real-life dynamic multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem that have crisp and fuzzy data under the PBL strategy. Practical implications This paper offers an integrated approach for performance analysis of service providers in a dynamic MCDM problem in which crisp and fuzzy data are used together. To illustrate applicability and validity of the proposed model, it is applied to a real-life problem. Originality/value This paper utilizes the DEA-MTFP index method and IFS theory in an integrated way.

TI  - Comparison of learning outcomes: Team-based vs. problem-based learning with high-Fidelity simulation in a critical care nursing course-a mixed-methods design
T2  - NURSE EDUCATION TODAY
AB  - Background: Few studies have evaluated the comparative effectiveness of team-based learning (TBL) and problem-based learning (PBL) combined with simulation in nursing education. Objective: This study aimed to compare the learning outcomes of TBL versus PBL, incorporating high-fidelity simulation (HFS) in a critical care nursing course. Methods: This study used a mixed-methods design with convenience sampling. Senior baccalaureate nursing students from a university of science and technology were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to the TBL or PBL group by class, each receiving their respective teaching strategies combined with HFS. Course outcomes were assessed using a variety of instruments, including a learning assessment (shock knowledge, Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support knowledge, and a final test), the Satisfaction with Simulation Experience Scale (SSES), the Confidence Scale, the Emergency Preparedness Simulation Learning Experience Scale (EPSLES), the Learning Experience Questionnaire, and a demographic questionnaire. Results: A total of 173 senior nursing students were included. A One-way ANCOVA was utilized to control for pretest and midterm test scores when comparing the learning effects. The analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in post-test shock knowledge scores between the two groups (F = 4.51, p = 0.04). The TBL group achieved significantly higher post-test scores compared to the PBL group. In contrast, following the HFS program, the PBL group showed significantly higher mean scores on the SSES and EPSLES than the TBL group (t = 2.09, p = 0.04; t = 2.59, p = 0.01, respectively). Conclusion: Our study evaluated the effectiveness of mixed teaching strategies in a critical care nursing course. Findings indicate that both TBL and PBL enhance learning outcomes. The TBL group demonstrated superior performance on the learning outcomes test, while the PBL group excelled in simulation satisfaction and emergency simulation learning experiences. These results provide insights for selecting appropriate teaching strategies in intensive care education for nursing students.

TI  - Problem-based learning method in the context of a flipped classroom: Outcomes on pain management course acquisition
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC SCHOLAR
AB  - Introduction: A deep understanding of physiology, physiopathology, pharmacology, and the management of pain is crucial for nurse anaesthetists to ensure the well-being of their patients. Thus, the teaching strategies should enhance the transition from acquiring the fundamental pain phenomena, to developing translational and critical thinking. The aim of the study is to determine if the flipped classroom that is considered an active learning approach is most effective compared to the traditional method in teaching pain management and if it improves students' academic performance. Methods: This study was quasi experimental, at a higher institute of nursing professions, among third-year anaesthesia resuscitation nursing students. participants were randomly allocated into either: the flipped classroom group where PBL was used (FG, n = 19), or the traditional lecture-based classroom group (TG, n = 19). The results and impact of the above approach were appreciated via the analysis of the summative assessment of the class group and from the questionnaire submitted to students. Results: The present study revealed that in the midterm exam, the mean score of the flipped classroom group (14.0) which is significantly higher (p<0.01) than the traditional lecture group (11.9). Moreover, the standard deviation of this latter is slightly higher (2.41) which indicates scores far from the average. Also, a significant difference between the averages of the two approaches in favor of flipped classroom Group was revealed (p<0.01). Conclusion: The assessment of student's grades and their appreciation of both teaching approaches showed a preference for the PBL.

TI  - DESIGN STUDIO REVIEW JUROR: CRITIC OR CONNOISSEUR?
T2  - 14TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED2020)
AB  - Design education is a specific setting that facilitates learning through lecturing, demonstrating and practicing. It relies heavily on project-based learning, studio-based learning, experiential learning, and public critique. Evaluating the quality of creative work in design education is unavoidably complex and controversial. Assessment involves fallible human judgment, especially in art and design. Studio assessment includes criticism, which is recognized as a form of design thinking. Criticism can be both formative and summative, and is best demonstrated in design education through the final studio review. This review event occurs at the end of a studio project. It is where students present their work to peers, faculty and invited external jurors. These jurors are either visiting faculty or practicing professionals. They are invited by the instructor as recognized experts in the discipline. But what level of expertise is required for a juror to successfully participate in this form of educational assessment?

TI  - Observational analysis of near-peer and faculty tutoring in problem-based learning groups
T2  - MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - ContextNear-peer and faculty staff tutors may facilitate problem-based learning (PBL) through different means. Near-peer tutors are thought to compensate for their lack of subject matter expertise with greater adeptness at group facilitation and a better understanding of their learners. However, theoretical explanations of tutor effectiveness have been developed largely from recollections of tutor practices gathered through student evaluation surveys, focus groups and interviews. A closer look at what happens during PBL sessions tutored by near-peers and faculty members seems warranted to augment theory from a grounded perspective.

AB  - In the present work sensitivity of Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) Model has been carried out using five planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes - Yonsei University Scheme (YSU), Mellor-Yamada-Janjic scheme (MYJ), Aymmetric Convective Model version 2 (ACM2), Quasi Normal Scale Elimination scheme (QNSE), Mellor-Yamada-Nakanishi-Niino scheme (MYNN) in different climatic zones over India namely Tropical, Temperate and Arid for surface meteorological parameters, upper air variables and planetary boundary layer height during summer and winter season. The model outputs have been compared with observations through standard statistical measures. The aim is to study the relative performance of these schemes, selecting the best option climatic zone-wise and thereby minimizing uncertainty in model predictions. WRF model performance evaluation shows better agreement for temperature and relative humidity compared to wind speed. Overall for India, ACM2, QNSE show good performance for temperature and relative humidity whereas ACM2, MYNN show better performance for wind speed though these may vary for different climatic zones. Geopotential height and wind over 850 hPa is well simulated by ACM2 and MYNN over India. For PBL height ACM2, MYNN and MYJ works best for Chennai, New Delhi and Kolkata respectively during summer period. However, for winter period MYJ works best for Chennai while, QNSE works best for New Delhi and Kolkata. Considering all meteorological parameters together, it is seen that for arid zone ACM2, QNSE and MYJ schemes work reasonably well. For temperate zone, ACM2, QNSE and MYNN schemes show better results. For tropical zone all PBL schemes work closely. Hence, depending on the application, parameter and climate zone, this study provides suitable recommendations for choosing PBL schemes appropriately for each zone and parameter separately for the Indian region.

TI  - Progress testing: critical analysis and suggested practices
T2  - ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION
AB  - Educators have long lamented the tendency of students to engage in rote memorization in preparation for tests rather than engaging in deep learning where they attempt to gain meaning from their studies. Rote memorization driven by objective exams has been termed a steering effect. Progress testing (PT), in which a comprehensive examination sampling all of medicine is administered repeatedly throughout the entire curriculum, was developed with the stated aim of breaking the steering effect of examinations and of promoting deep learning. PT is an approach historically linked to problem-based learning (PBL) although there is a growing recognition of its applicability more broadly. The purpose of this article is to summarize the salient features of PT drawn from the literature, provide a critical review of these features based upon the same literature and psychometric considerations drawn from the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing and provide considerations of what should be part of best practices in applying PT from an evidence-based and a psychometric perspective.

TI  - Academic Performance in University Students in Morphological Science Courses: Use of Active Problem-Based Learning (PBL)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY
AB  - University education seeks to develop professional skills and capacities for autonomous learning. Active learning methodologies, centered on students, such as problem-based learning (PBL), could be very useful in improving academic performance in Basic Sciences courses in health and medical students. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of the use of the active problem-based learning methodology on the academic performance of university students who take morpho-biological courses in the Kinesiology and Obstetrics degree programs. From a total of 500 students who entered the first years of health degrees at the University of Tarapaca (academic year 2018), 100 students (over 18 years of age) were selected, separating as a control or non-intervened group (n = 50) to Obstetrics students and intervened group, with application of ABP (n = 50), students of the Kinesiology degree program. The study lasted 24 school weeks. The results show that the intervened group significantly improved academic performance, with 98 % approval and a final evaluation of 5.9. The control group achieved 84 % approval and a final evaluation of 4.8. It is concluded that the use of the active PBL methodology significantly improves the academic performance of health sciences students who take morpho-biological subjects and that activities with direct participation through questionnaires and group and individual scientific presentations, allow the student be their own agent of change in the educational assessment processes. It is suggested to implement this type of active methodologies in regular courses, also considering the psychological factors of learning.

TI  - Sensitivity of PBL parameterization schemes in simulating lightning and thunderstorm using WRF-ELEC model
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
AB  - Climate change's impact on lightning and thunderstorms is uncertain. This study evaluates the sensitivity of multiple Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) parameterisation schemes within the WRF-ELEC model for simulating a severe lightning and thunderstorm event in Bihar on 25 June 2020. The aim is to understand how these schemes affect lightning and thunderstorm intensity. The model was integrated for 54 h at 0000 UTC on 24 June 2020 using 6-hourly NCEP FNL Operational Global Analysis data at 1 degrees x1 degrees resolution over Bihar with double nested domains of 9 km (D1) and 3 km (D2). It effectively captures the peak lightning and thunderstorm activity from 0000 to 0900 UTC on 25 June 2020, significantly impacting certain regions. The study utilised ERA5 and IMDAA reanalysis datasets and NASA GPM IMERG daily data to analyse the event and assess the model's performance. Among the PBL schemes tested, ACM2, BouLac, SHsa, and MRF exhibit robust performance. Flash Origin Density (FOD) patterns broadly match observations, although occasional discrepancies occur in southern Bihar. Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) and precipitation (mm) analysis reveals anticipated trends. Statistical scores highlight strong performance by ACM2, UW, and GBM schemes in POFD/FAR. The MRF scheme excels in POD/Hit Rate, and the UW scheme achieves the highest score for 24-h accumulated total precipitation. HSS and GSS/ETS underscore the superior performance of the UW and GBM schemes. This study offers insights into lightning and thunderstorm simulations over Bihar with diverse PBL parameterisation schemes in the WRF-ELEC model.

TI  - Competition and Collaboration Using a Social and Gamified Online Learning Platform
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON GAMES BASED LEARNING
AB  - Gamification is defined as the use of game techniques in a non-game context and has demonstrated potential impact in a wide range of subjects. Informed by the design and processes of digital gaming, gamification often exploits competition to motivate, personified by points, badges and leader boards. Success, however, seems to go beyond these basic features and rely on a concrete acknowledgement of the motivational model of the user, taking into account concepts such as situational relevance and situated motivational affordance, which can be framed under competition and/or collaboration. This paper investigates the impact of competitive and collaborative environments on summative assessment. This study bases its investigation on the StarQuest platform (http://starquest.eu/), a social and gamified collaboration application hosting a private online environment for small groups of individuals to co-curate and share digital contents. Participants were second year undergraduate students (Sport Psychology, n=94), who enrolled on a module entitled "A Fundamental Approach to Motor Learning and Control". The module ran for 11 weeks and the curriculum was delivered using a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach. The results highlighted a number of strengths and weaknesses of implementing a gamified online platform for team working, which will inform future design, development and deployment of gamified and learning platforms.

TI  - Assessment in PBL-Do We Assess the Learner or the Product?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
AB  - Grading individual students in teams or projects has always been problematic. To accurately gauge individual learning outcomes, students' grades need to be based on what they have learned as an individual within the team or project context. However, within engineering team-based projects, individuals have traditionally been assigned a grade heavily influenced by the team's project outcomes. Final year engineering projects (FYEP) suffer from similar problems. While typically in the Australian context, the projects are conducted by individuals, they are still conducted using the philosophy of PBL. To provide a reliable indicator of student capability and program quality and standards, FYEPs must be coherent, valid and reliable instruments for student assessment and program evaluation. This paper considers two Australian engineering education projects, one recently completed and one current, that investigate the issues of; how can individuals who learn in a team environment be assessed as individuals?, how can the outcomes from final year engineering projects be used to demonstrate the standards required by various state and professional accrediting agencies? And what are the issues that prevent staff effectively assessing the learning outcomes of individual students who learn in the project environment? The paper outlines an assessment model that was trialled and discusses the issues arising. The difference between this form of assessment and others in engineering education is that it assesses the learning outcomes of the individuals as opposed to assessing the product of the team. The paper also discusses the results from the first stage of data gathering on final year projects in Australia. The conclusion is that assessing the product rather than the learner degrades the opportunity to use projects as evidence of learning, but continues because it is easier for academic staff.

TI  - The Views of Undergraduates about Problem-based Learning Applications in a Biochemistry Course
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION
AB  - The effect of problem-based learning (PBL) applications in an undergraduate biochemistry course on students' interest in this course was investigated through four modules during one semester. Students' views about active learning and improvement in social skills were also collected and evaluated. We conducted the study with 36 senior students from the Faculty of Science at Dokuz Eylul University in Turkey. Pre- and post-tests were the primary tools used in this study and the Problem-Based Learning Assessment Scale was applied after each module to assess the students' views about the applications. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to determine students' pre- and post- attitudes toward the biochemistry course. According to the results, problem quality played an important role in students' academic achievement. The decreased orientation role played by the tutor toward the end of the PBL process showed that students could find the necessary information by investigating themselves, and associate new information and experiences with their existing knowledge. Additionally, results of semi-structured interviews indicated that their skills in the areas of working collaboratively in a group, fulfilling responsibilities and expression of ideas in a group also improved. In conclusion, it can be argued that PBL as an active learning approach is very effective for formation of knowledge, improvement in social skills and interest in a biochemistry course.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of the WRF-Chem Model with Different Physical Parameterization Schemes during an Extremely High PM2.5 Pollution Episode in Beijing
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
AB  - To understand the impacts of different combinations of planetary boundary layer (PBL), short-wave (SW) and long-wave (LW) radiation schemes on the simulation results of meteorological variables and PM2.5 concentrations under extremely heavy pollution conditions, the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model was applied in Beijing to investigate a high PM2.5 pollution episode that occurred in January, 2013. Four PBL schemes, two SW schemes and three LW schemes with a total of 12 ensemble experiments were conducted in this study. The simulated meteorological variables including the temperature at 2 m (T2), the wind speed at 10 m (WS10) and the relative humidity (RH) were compared with their actual observations and the PM2.5 concentrations. A correlation analysis between the PM2.5 and T2, WS10 and RH values was also explored. The results indicated that there were no ideal scheme combinations that were most suitable for all meteorological variable simulations during this heavy pollution episode in Beijing. With the same emissions input, the simulation results of the WRF-Chem model that were configured with different physical parameterization schemes may vary significantly. As for the PM2.5 simulation, the combination of the YSU PBL, Goddard SW and GFDL LW schemes showed the greatest consistency with the observed values. Although the PBL schemes have the dominant impacts on the simulations of meteorological variables, the selection of LW and SW schemes is of the same importance.

TI  - Toward an Integrative Nursing Curriculum: Combining Team-Based and Problem-Based Learning with Emergency-Care Scenario Simulation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Objective: The study intended to combine team-oriented, problem-based learning (PBL) with emergency-care simulation to investigate whether an integrative intervention could positively impact the core nursing competencies and teacher performance of nursing students. Methods: The study belonged to the domain of action research, which aimed to address the weaknesses of traditional teacher-led, lecture-based learning. An 18-week, single-case experimental design, in which 58 senior nursing students at a medical university in central Taiwan participated, was conducted to test the possible benefits of the intervention. The measures included the Scale of Core Nursing Competencies and the Teacher Performance Evaluation Scale. Results: The research results showed that nursing students who received integrative training that combined team-based PBL with emergency-care scenario simulation had stronger mastery over core nursing competencies. At the same time, they also evaluated both the "Emergency Care" course for which the curriculum was used and the teachers' performance in that course more highly. Conclusions: The findings suggest that an integrative curriculum combining team-based PBL with scenario simulation is worth pursuing. Compared with traditional teacher-led, lecture-based teaching, this curriculum may be more effective in helping nursing students develop core competencies in their field.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of PBL Schemes of ARW Model in Simulating Thermo-Dynamical Structure of Pre-Monsoon Convective Episodes over Kharagpur Using STORM Data Sets
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
AB  - In the present study, advanced research WRF (ARW) model is employed to simulate convective thunderstorm episodes over Kharagpur (22A degrees 30'N, 87A degrees 20'E) region of Gangetic West Bengal, India. High-resolution simulations are conducted using 1 x 1 degree NCEP final analysis meteorological fields for initial and boundary conditions for events. The performance of two non-local [Yonsei University (YSU), Asymmetric Convective Model version 2 (ACM2)] and two local turbulence kinetic energy closures [Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ), Bougeault-Lacarrere (BouLac)] are evaluated in simulating planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameters and thermodynamic structure of the atmosphere. The model-simulated parameters are validated with available in situ meteorological observations obtained from micro-meteorological tower as well has high-resolution DigiCORA radiosonde ascents during STORM-2007 field experiment at the study location and Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) imageries. It has been found that the PBL structure simulated with the TKE closures MYJ and BouLac are in better agreement with observations than the non-local closures. The model simulations with these schemes also captured the reflectivity, surface pressure patterns such as wake-low, meso-high, pre-squall low and the convective updrafts and downdrafts reasonably well. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons reveal that the MYJ followed by BouLac schemes better simulated various features of the thunderstorm events over Kharagpur region. The better performance of MYJ followed by BouLac is evident in the lesser mean bias, mean absolute error, root mean square error and good correlation coefficient for various surface meteorological variables as well as thermo-dynamical structure of the atmosphere relative to other PBL schemes. The better performance of the TKE closures may be attributed to their higher mixing efficiency, larger convective energy and better simulation of humidity promoting moist convection relative to non-local schemes.

TI  - Performance evaluation of the WRF model in a tropical region: Wind speed analysis at different sites
T2  - ATMOSFERA
AB  - In this study, the performance of the mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is evalua-ted using combinations of three planetary boundary layers (PBL) (YSU, ACM2, and MYJ) and three land surface model (LSM) schemes (RUC, Noah and Noah-MP) in order to identify the optimal parameters for the determination of wind speed in a tropical region. The state of Bahia in Brazil is selected as the location for the case study and simulations are performed over a period of eight months between 2015 and 2016 (dry and rainy seasons). The results of the simulations are compared with observational data obtained from three towers equipped with anemometers at heights of 80, 100, 120 and 150 m, strategically placed at each site and evaluated with statistical indices: MB, RMSE, MAGE, IOA, R, Fac2 and standard deviation. Overestimation of wind speed is observed in the simulations, despite similarities between the simulated and observed wind directions. In addition, the accuracies of simulations corresponding to sites that are closer to the ocean are observed to be lower. The most accurate wind speed estimates are obtained corresponding to Mucuge, which is located farthest from the ocean. Finally, analysis of the results obtained from each tower accounting for periods with higher and lower precipitation reveals that the combination of the PBL-YSU scheme with the LSM-RUC scheme yields the best results.

TI  - DILEMMS IN EVALUATIVE PRACTICES AND TRAINING NEEDS FOR TUTORS IN THE PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING (PBL) METHOD
T2  - COMUNICACOES
AB  - This article presents research results whose goal is identified and discuss professional dilemmas in the field of learning assessment and formative needs of teachers-tutors who work on the Problem Based Learning (PBL) method of the Computer Engineering course at a public university in the State of Bahia. In fact, the following guiding question subsidized the development of the investigative process: what professional dilemmas, in terms of assessment processes, and formative needs of teachers-tutors of a public university can be evidenced through the teaching case methods? We are supported theoretically in reflections of Shulman (2014); Mizukami (2004); Zabalza (1994); Cunha (2015), among others. Methodologically, it is characterized by being a descriptive-analytical study, with a qualitative approach. The data were collected through the application of a teaching case, whose analysis was based on assumptions of the technique of content analysis, involving the three stages signaled by Bardin (1977). The data indicate that the participants' formative needs are concentrated in the pedagogical dimension, thus showing weaknesses in of these professionals' knowledge base of teaching. Regarding to the dilemmas, the tutors' testimonies emphasized the complex conduct of evaluative practices with the students in the context of the tutorial sessions and the students' unethical posture in the evaluative practices, especially, self-evaluation. Based on these aspects, we point out the need to design a proposal for ongoing training for research subjects, aiming their professional development.

TI  - A simple approach of applying blended learning to problem-based learning is feasible, accepted and does not affect evaluation and exam results-a just pre-pandemic randomised controlled mixed-method study
T2  - NAUNYN-SCHMIEDEBERGS ARCHIVES OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - We tested for feasibility, acceptance, and "non-inferiority" of small-group teaching applying blended learning (i.e., the integration of face-to-face and online instruction) to problem-based learning (bPbL) compared to conventional PbL (cPbL). In a just pre-pandemic, randomised controlled trial, 317 students attended either bPbL or cPbL groups. The first meeting of the bPbL groups took place online via written internet chat, while cPbL groups met on site. All groups met on site the second time. All students had the opportunity to attend lectures either on site or as videos on demand. We analysed student evaluation data, results in a final summative exam, attendance of lectures on site and use of lecture videos. Furthermore, we performed a qualitative analysis of student statements made in semi-structured group interviews about pros and cons of the bPbL approach. There was no difference between students of either bPbL or cPbL groups with respect to exam results (score: 14.3 +/- 2.8 vs. 13.8 +/- 2.7) or course evaluation. However, relatively more bPbL than cPbL students reported having used lecture videos, while the proportion of those attending lectures on-site was higher among cPbL students. Interviews revealed that some of the bPbL students' experiences were unexpected and feared disadvantages seemed to be less severe than expected. Participation in a blended PbL format did not worsen course evaluations or exam results, but seemed to influence lecture attendance. The combination of face-to-face and digital elements could be suitable as a hybrid approach to digital instruction in the post-pandemic era.

TI  - Evaluation of Different WRF Parametrizations over the Region of Iasi with Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
AB  - This article aims to present an evaluation of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with multiple instruments when applied to a humid continental region, in this case, the region around the city of Iasi, Romania. A series of output parameters are compared with observed data, obtained on-site, with a focus on the Planetary Boundary Layer Height (PBLH) and on PBLH-related parametrizations used by the WRF model. The impact of each different parametrization on physical quantities is highlighted during the two chosen measurement intervals, both of them in the warm season of 2016 and 2017, respectively. The instruments used to obtain real data to compare to the WRF simulations are: a lidar platform, a photometer, and ground-level (GL) meteorological instrumentation for the measurement of temperature, average wind speed, and pressure. Maps of PBLH and 2 m above ground-level (AGL) atmospheric temperature are also presented, compared to a topological and relief map of the inner nest of the WRF simulation. Finally, a comprehensive simulation performance evaluation of PBLH, temperature, wind speed, and pressure at the surface and total precipitable water vapor is performed.

AB  - The present study evaluates different physical parameterization schemes available in Weather Research and Forecasting model version 3.8 (WRF-ARW) over the Angul-Talcher region of Odisha state in India. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out for various schemes for planetary boundary layer, microphysics, and radiation in the WRF model, which have not been tested over this Indian region that often experiences extreme heat in summer (> 45 degrees C) as well as high air pollution. Performance evaluation is based on in situ observations of near-surface temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity during a representative case of peak summer conditions. It was inferred from analysis of several sets of simulations that the combination of GBM PBL scheme, Lin microphysics, and RRTMG radiation scheme performs better for near surface parameters such as temperature at 2 m (overall RMSE of 2.19 degrees C, in daytime and 2.06 degrees C in nighttime), relative humidity (RMSE: 20.65%), and wind in comparison to the rest of the combinations. Furthermore, the various schemes were also tested with observed vertical profile of wind speed, temperature, and heat fluxes, to arrive at the overall conclusions of this study.

TI  - WRF Physics Ensemble Performance Evaluation over Continental and Coastal Regions in Germany
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
AB  - WRF is used to simulate eight extreme precipitation events that occurred over the regions of Schleswig-Holstein and Baden-Wurttemberg in Germany. The events were chosen from the German Weather Service (DWD) catalog and exceeded the DWD's warning level 3 (i.e., rainfall > 40 mm/h). A two-way nesting approach is used with 9 and 3 km spatial resolutions. Initial and boundary conditions are obtained from the ERA5 dataset at 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees. To model each event, thirty different parameterization configurations were used, accounting for all possible combinations of five microphysics (MP), three cumulus (CU), and two planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization methods, yielding a total of 240 simulations. TOPSIS multicriteria analysis technique is employed to determine the performance skill of each setup and rank them, using six categorical and five statistical metrics. Resolution increase from 9 to 3 km did not improve forecasting accuracy temporally or in intensity. According to TOPSIS ranking, when treating each event individually, the ideal parameterizations combination is spatiotemporally dependent, with certain members ranking higher. When all events are considered, the Morrison double-moment MP-Grell-Freitas CU-YSU PBL combination works best with a frequency of occurrence in the top five performing scenarios of 30%, 47.5%, and 57.5% respectively.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of Planetary Boundary Layer Schemes in Simulating Structures of Wintertime Lower Troposphere in Seoul Using One-Hour Interval Radiosonde Observation
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - We investigated the structures of the wintertime lower troposphere in Seoul, South Korea on 17 and 18 January 2017 by performing 1 h interval radiosonde observation and numerical simulations. In the daytime on 17 January, the height of the convective boundary layer (CBL) sharply and quickly increased when the residual layer became a part of the CBL. From the afternoon on 17 January, moist air with clouds began to substantially intrude in the lower troposphere in Seoul, and radiative heating/cooling weakened. As a result, the mixing of air in the lower troposphere was inhibited and the vertical gradients of potential temperature and water vapor mixing ratio changed little on 18 January. We evaluated the performance of four planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization schemes (the Yonsei University (YSU), Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ), Mellor-Yamada-Nakanishi-Niino (MYNN), and Asymmetric Convective Model version 2 (ACM2) schemes) coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting model in simulating the structures of the lower troposphere against 1 h interval radiosonde observation. The general tendencies of the air temperature and wind speed in the lower troposphere were well-reproduced in the four simulations. However, the sharp increase in the CBL height did not appear in the four simulations, implying that the process of the residual layer becoming a part of the CBL in the daytime is not well-parameterized. Additionally, the simulated water vapor mixing ratio near the surface was smaller compared with the observation. We found that small-scale turbulence in the CBL, which mixes advected air and pre-existing air, was not reproduced well by the PBL parameterization schemes. Compared with the other simulations, the most accurate air temperature and wind speed were reproduced in the simulation with the MYJ scheme, while the CBL development and moisture advection were reproduced relatively well in the simulation with the MYNN scheme.

TI  - EVALUATION OF A LESSON RESOURCE FOR PROBLEM-BASED / BLENDED-LEARNING IN THE UNDERGRADUATE COURSE OF APPLIED ANIMAL BIOLOGY
T2  - ICERI2015: 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION
AB  - A learning-centred system, where the acquired knowledge must be understood by the students to apply it in real life, has two important aspects requiring improvement: (1) how the students evaluate their acquisition of problem-based learning (PBL), and (2) how teachers can lower time for assessing students' activities. To provide the activities with a formative assessment, students must be informed about their results with a good and fast feedback. It may be, however, too much effort for training assessments that usually are a small percentage of the final grade. To reconcile both above-mentioned aspects, we designed a PBL with the Moodle Lesson module. The aims of this study are: (1) to analyse the use of this tool in our teaching-learning process, validating the training capacity of the resource, (2) to evaluate the adequacy of the tool with the students' progress, (3) to assess the formative capacity of the tool on the training and skills achieved with its use, and (4) to minimize the effort of the teachers in the activity follow-up.

TI  - Performance evalu1ation of the WRF model under different physical schemes for air quality purposes in Buenos Aires, Argentina
T2  - ATMOSFERA
AB  - This work presents the performance evaluation of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to estimate surface wind speed and direction, air temperature, and water vapor mixing ratio considering 22 configurations at high spatial resolution (1 km) during one week in winter and one week in spring, in order to determine the best-performing schemes for air quality purposes in the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Ai-res, Argentina. Results show that the use of urban schemes mostly affects wind speed and temperature. The single-layer urban canopy model (UCM) coupled with the Boulac planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme exhibits the best results for wind speed. Wind direction and water vapor mixing ratio are more sensitive to the land surface model scheme, with results slightly improving with the Noah-MP land surface model. Wind speed and direction errors are larger when the former is lower. When removing from the analysis wind speed values below 2.6 m s-1 for the winter week and 3.1 m s-1 for the spring week, the root mean square errors for wind direction decreased between 50 and 72% of the original value, depending on the configuration and week. Overall, under the studied conditions, configurations including Noah-Mp land surface model or the combination of a simple UCM with BouLac PBL are suitable for air quality applications, as they reproduce both temperature and water vapor mixing ratio relatively well, with errors below 10% and Correlation values above 0.7, and are the best performing configurations for wind direction and speed, respectively.

TI  - Competence and training in interventional pulmonology
T2  - PANMINERVA MEDICA
AB  - I nterventional pulmonology (IP) is experiencing a rapid evolution of new technologies. There is a need to develop structured training programs, organized in high volume expert centers in order to improve trainee education, and including the development of validated metrics for their competency assessment. Concerning teaching methods, a gradual progression from theory to practice, using new teaching techniques, including live sessions and low and high-fidelity simulation, flipped classroom models and problem-based learning (PBL) exercises would provide a training setting more suitable for our current need to improve skills and update professionals. Training programs should be learner-centered and competence-oriented, as well as being based on a spiral-shaped approach in which the same subject is addressed many times, from new and different perspectives of knowledge, ability, behavior and attitude, until the trainee has demonstrated a high degree of skill and professionalism. Furthermore there is a need to standardize the training programs as guide for physicians wishing to undertake a gradual and voluntary improvement of their own competencies, and assist those planning and organizing training programs in IP. The article includes a general part on core curriculum contents, innovative training methods and simulation, and introduces the following articles on the skills that the Interventional Pulmonologist must master in order to perform the different procedures. This monography should be considered a starting point that will evolve over time and results in better training for practitioners and better care for our patients. The task of establishing a trainee's competence to practice independently as an Interventional Pulmonologist remains the responsibility of the IP fellowship program director and faculty, who validate logbooks and assess competence for each procedure. These standards need to be reviewed and approved by national and International Scientific Societies and Healthcare Institutions with the aim to improve, disseminate and incorporate them in healthcare programs.

TI  - Data Science Course Design for a Large-Scale Cohort using Individual Project-Based Learning
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 7TH CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING EDUCATION PRACTICE, CEP 2023
AB  - Being an effective data scientist includes mastering many skills, both technical and analytical. There are many great teaching resources for learning technical skills. However, the analytical skills of understanding customer values, proposing causal relationships and gathering datasets are less common. This paper describes a new data science course designed to emphasize these analytical skills using individual project-based learning (PBL). PBL is considered to be a valuable teaching approach in computer science education. However, such courses typically have large-scale cohorts, resulting in PBL being used as group work. Our approach using individual PBL, circumvents issues concerning team dynamics and individual student assessment within group work. This course is designed to work for a large-scale (75+) postgraduate cohort of both full- and part-time students. To facilitate the large-scale cohort the course makes use of a virtual learning environment (VLE) and recorded lectures. Students were able to choose the subject of their project and what software they would use to create visualizations. This paper provides details of a novel approach to teaching data science using individual PBL for a large-scale cohort while maintaining education quality.

TI  - The Concept of Digital Twin for Construction Safety
T2  - CONSTRUCTION RESEARCH CONGRESS 2022: COMPUTER APPLICATIONS, AUTOMATION, AND DATA ANALYTICS
AB  - "Digital twins" as models for information-driven management and control of physical systems have emerged over the past years in multiple industrial sectors and recently also in construction. However, in the domain of construction safety, a digital twin remains undefined, with little or no consensus among researchers and practitioners of two essential aspects: (1) the connection between the physical reality of a construction site (the "physical" twin) and the corresponding computer model (the "digital" twin), and (2) the most effective selection and exploitation of reallife data for supporting safe design, planning, and execution of construction. This paper outlines the concept for a Digital Twin for Construction Safety (DTCS), defining three essential steps in the digital twin workflow: (1) safe design and planning for hazard prevention, (2) risk monitoring and control for proactive prediction and warning, and (3) continuous performance improvement for personalized- or project-based learning. DTCS should be viewed as a system-based approach enhancing the overall safety performance rather than exclusively integrating sensing information or safety knowledge in Building Information Modeling (BIM) for safety purposes. The result is an outline of our vision of the DTCS and a description of its components. Additionally, we point toward future research on the topic.

TI  - Experimental Evaluation of a Serious Game for Teaching Software Process Modeling
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
AB  - Software process modeling (SPM) is an important area of software engineering because it provides a basis for managing, automating, and supporting software process improvement (SPI). Teaching SPM is a challenging task, mainly because it lays great emphasis on theory and offers few practical exercises. Furthermore, as yet few teaching approaches have aimed at teaching SPM by introducing innovative features, such as games. The use of games has mainly been focused on other areas of software engineering, for example software project management. In an attempt to fill this gap, this paper describes a formal experiment carried out to assess the learning effectiveness of a serious game (DesigMPS), designed to support the teaching of SPM, and to compare game-based learning with a project-based learning method. In the DesigMPS game, the student models a software process from an SPI perspective, based on the Brazilian SPI model (MPS. BR). The results indicate that playing the game can have a positive learning effect and results in a greater degree of learning effectiveness than does the project-based learning instructional method.

TI  - Teachers' Perceptions of the Digital Transformation of the Classroom through the Use of Tablets: A Study in Spain
T2  - COMUNICAR
AB  - This study examines the transformation of classroom dynamics brought about by the use of tablets for educational purposes. The empirical bases of this study were defined by the "Samsung Smart School" project, which was developed by Samsung and Spain's Ministry of Education during academic year 2014-15, in which teachers and 5th and 6th year students attending 15 primary schools across several Autonomous Communities in Spain were provided with tablets. The research sample comprised 166 teachers. A qualitative analysis strategy was applied by means of: a) non-participant observation, b) focus groups, c) semi-structured interviews with teachers, and d) content analysis of teaching units. These techniques enabled us to extract and examine six dimensions of teaching (educational objective, teaching approach, organization of content and activities, teaching resources, space and time, and learning assessment). Our findings show that teachers tend to apply a transversal approach when using tablets to work on different competencies, focusing more on activities than on content through the use of apps. They reclaim the act of play as part of the learning process, and indicate tablet use encourages project-based learning. To sum up, this study shows that teachers view tablets not only as a technological challenge, but also as an opportunity to rethink their traditional teaching models.

TI  - The Impact of PBL as a STEM School Reform Model
T2  - INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL OF PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING
AB  - Project/problem-based learning (PBL) can provide an effective model for school reform when implemented with fidelity. In the report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm, it was recommended that if the U.S. is to remain competitive in the 21st-century economy, there must be a serious effort to "enlarge the pipeline of students who are prepared to enter college and graduate with a degree in STEM" (National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, & Institute of Medicine, 2007, p. 6). The report included the recommendation that states develop statewide specialty STEM high schools (National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, & Institute of Medicine, 2007, p. 6). In 2010, the Texas Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Academy (T-STEM) initiative was implemented to develop specialty STEM schools similar to those described in Rising Above the Gathering Storm. The primary instructional strategy of T-STEM academies is problem- and project-based learning. In the STEM context, PBL is well suited as a primary pedagogy for STEM learning. This paper examines the following questions: What outcomes occur when PBL is implemented in a low performing school district? What is the role of PBL in school improvement? What are the challenges to implementing PBL with high fidelity?

TI  - A Mathematics Pipeline to Student Success in Data Analytics through Course-Based Undergraduate Research
T2  - MATHEMATICS ENTHUSIAST
AB  - This paper reports on Data Analytics Research (DAR), a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) in which undergraduate students conduct data analysis research on open real-world problems for industry, university, and community clients. We describe how DAR, offered by the Mathematical Sciences Department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), is an essential part of an early low-barrier pipeline into data analytics studies and careers for diverse students. Students first take a foundational course, typically Introduction to Data Mathematics, that teaches linear algebra, data analytics, and R programming simultaneously using a project-based learning (PBL) approach. Then in DAR, students work in teams on open applied data analytics research problems provided by the clients. We describe the DAR organization which is inspired in part by agile software development practices. Students meet for coaching sessions with instructors multiple times a week and present to clients frequently. In a fully remote format during the pandemic, the students continued to be highly successful and engaged in COVID-19 research producing significant results as indicated by deployed online applications, refereed papers, and conference presentations. Formal evaluation shows that the pipeline of the single on-ramp course followed by DAR addressing real-world problems with societal benefits is highly effective at developing students' data analytics skills, advancing creative problem solvers who can work both independently and in teams, and attracting students to further studies and careers in data science.

TI  - Project-based learning for middle school students monitoring standby power: replication of impact on stem knowledge and dispositions
T2  - ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Middle school students participating in energy-monitoring activities guided by their teachers during 2009-2011 gained (p < .05) in content knowledge and became more positive in their dispositions toward STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). No comparison group data were gathered for this initial study. Activities were replicated with a new group of treatment students during 2013-2014, adding a comparison group not receiving the treatment. Matched pre-post data from 2013 to 2014 confirmed gains in knowledge of environmental science and vampire power (p < .0001, effect size = .86). Aggregate dispositions toward science, mathematics, engineering and technology became more positive for treatment versus comparison group students (p = .023). Gains in STEM dispositions for girls were more positive (effect size = .37) than for boys. Implications of these findings are that hands-on, inquiry-based science activities may help increase the STEM career pipeline in ways that can lead to broader participation in STEM careers in the future.

TI  - NE STEM 4U: an out-of-school time academic program to improve achievement of socioeconomically disadvantaged youth in STEM areas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION
AB  - Background: The Nebraska Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics 4U (NE STEM 4U) program was initiated at the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO) in 2013. NE STEM 4U is a student-run, faculty-led program facilitating problem-based learning (PBL) sessions in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) for socioeconomically disadvantaged kindergarten through grade 8 (K-8) students. PBL sessions are provided throughout the academic year in a twice-weekly, after-school, informal education program. The instructional material provided after school builds upon the curricula of the school day. Importantly, this program is a partnership between faculty members and administrators in higher education at UNO with community partners of Omaha including Collective for Youth, Beyond School Bells, and Omaha Public Schools. We focus on engaging K-8 youth in after-school immersion experiences in STEM fields using undergraduate students as mentors and facilitators using a model of problem-based learning.

TI  - Automating Periodontal bone loss measurement via dental landmark localisation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY
AB  - Purpose Periodontitis is the sixth most prevalent disease worldwide and periodontal bone loss (PBL) detection is crucial for its early recognition and establishment of the correct diagnosis and prognosis. Current radiographic assessment by clinicians exhibits substantial interobserver variation. Computer-assisted radiographic assessment can calculate bone loss objectively and aid in early bone loss detection. Understanding the rate of disease progression can guide the choice of treatment and lead to early initiation of periodontal therapy. Methodology We propose an end-to-end system that includes a deep neural network with hourglass architecture to predict dental landmarks in single, double and triple rooted teeth using periapical radiographs. We then estimate the PBL and disease severity stage using the predicted landmarks. We also introduce a novel adaptation of MixUp data augmentation that improves the landmark localisation. Results We evaluate the proposed system using cross-validation on 340 radiographs from 63 patient cases containing 463, 115 and 56 single, double and triple rooted teeth. The landmark localisation achieved Percentage Correct Keypoints (PCK) of 88.9%, 73.9% and 74.4%, respectively, and a combined PCK of 83.3% across all root morphologies, outperforming the next best architecture by 1.7%. When compared to clinicians' visual evaluations of full radiographs, the average PBL error was 10.69%, with a severity stage accuracy of 58%. This simulates current interobserver variation, implying that diverse data could improve accuracy. Conclusions The system showed a promising capability to localise landmarks and estimate periodontal bone loss on periapical radiographs. An agreement was found with other literature that non-CEJ (Cemento-Enamel Junction) landmarks are the hardest to localise. Honing the system's clinical pipeline will allow for its use in intervention applications.

AB  - The development of skills and competencies in chemical processes simulation is of key relevance for students enrolled in Chemical Engineering, due to process modelling allows for the analysis of complex systems and cheap evaluation of multiple configurations and operating conditions without risk of accidents or damage to real facilities. Thus, students taking the course "Simulation and Optimization of Chemical Processes," which is placed on the seventh semester of the Chemical Engineering Degree at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, must master a series of basic operations to design systems that simulate real-life situations in the chemical industry. To reach this goal, active learning methodologies, such as Problem-Based Learning (PBL), are often used, especially those based on open-ended problem cases. However, their complexity makes difficult to reach a numerical solution within the given time, in addition to representing a significant workload for instructors because the necessity of continuous supervision and support. To address these issues, the present proposal suggests combining the PBL approach with gamification through Genially. This strategy offers students a highly interactive and dynamic guide to solve the proposed cases, providing immediate feedback and promoting the development of critical competencies. An example can be seen in Figure 1a, which shows a gamification example carried out during the last academic year 2023/24.This activity aimed to facilitate decision-making in the design and simulation of a pumping, cooling, and piping system based on real gas pipeline data. After completing the activity, a survey about the proposed task was contemplated (Figure 1b), showing a high level of satisfaction between the students while highlighting how appealing they found this methodology. This resulted in a better understanding of the concepts intended to be practiced, making the resolution of the practice case more enjoyable and effective compared to traditional methods or those based solely on PBL used in previous academic years.

AB  - Ground-based magnetometer stations represent a multi-viewpoint and easy-to-access system for sounding Earth's magnetic field disturbances in the inner magnetosphere. Using Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) measurements recorded from pairs of meridionally aligned stations, it is possible to determine the Field Line Resonance (FLR) frequencies, which are directly related to the equatorial magnetospheric plasma mass density. Recently, it has been shown by Foldes et al. (J Geophys Res 126(5):e2020JA029008. https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JA029008, 2021) that the Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are valuable tools for detecting FLRs by exploiting the useful information provided by cross-phase Fourier spectra, which are at the heart of the ULF technique for inferring the magnetospheric mass density. The main shortcoming of this approach is that it is not possible to discriminate between active and quiet times in terms of resonances. It is commonly known that detecting FLRs using cross-phase spectra may often be unfeasible due to data gaps, noisy signals, and/or quiescent ULF wave periods. To handle these situations, we implement an ML classification algorithm to identify periods when the resonance frequencies are observable and thus easily estimated. Our algorithm can distinguish samples into three main classes: periods with observed frequency ("Freq" class) from others ("NoFreq"), and, in addition, it can determine whether the considered field line crosses the plasmasphere boundary layer (PBL or plasmapause) at a given time. The results of our method are validated for a particular pair of stations (at L = 2.9) along the Equatorial quasi-Meridional Magnetometer Array (EMMA), using a large dataset comprising different geomagnetic conditions. The proposed approach might be combined with a regression algorithm (such as those proposed in Foldes et al. (J Geophys Res 126(5):e2020JA029008. https:// doi.org/10.1029/2020JA0290 08, 2021)) in a two-stage ML pipeline, with the ultimate goal of implementing a completely automated system for the real-time monitoring of the plasmasphere dynamics from ground-based magnetometer stations.
