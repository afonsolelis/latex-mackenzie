TI  - From Experience to Inquiry to Generalization: Understanding the STEM-PBL Learning Process and Developing a Formative Assessment Model
T2  - RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION
AB  - As an effective teaching strategy and learning mode in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, STEM project-based learning (STEM-PBL) has gained global acceptance among teachers and students. However, there is a lack of research on the STEM-PBL learning process, and no relevant model to guide STEM-PBL formative assessment. Therefore, this study aims to explore the STEM-PBL learning process and then develop a formative assessment model to support learning and assessment activities based on this process. We developed hypotheses on relationships in the STEM-PBL learning process based on Whitehead's educational philosophy of "the rhythm of education," which informed the design of the formative assessment model. Data were analyzed from 304 Chinese elementary school students in STEM clubs. Study results show: (1) The STEM-PBL learning process consists of "STEM-PBL Experience" "STEM-PBL Inquiry" and "STEM-PBL Generalization," with each positive impact existing between the stages. In addition, the STEM-PBL Inquiry stage mediates the relationship between the STEM-PBL Experience stage and the STEM-PBL Generalization stage. (2) The formative assessment model based on the STEM-PBL learning process is well-founded. "Engineering design" "Hands-on inquiry" and "Behavioral participation" are the assessment elements that should be valued in each stage of the STEM-PBL learning process. The model constructed in this study can help students develop a clear mind of their learning process and provide teachers with strategies for designing STEM-PBL formative assessment activities.

TI  - Online Project-Based Learning and Formative Assessment
T2  - TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING
AB  - Project-based learning (PBL) involves a highly complex and learner-centered approach. It relies on formative assessment (FA) with ongoing feedback to help learners move through the PBL process to the eventual co-construction of a shared artefact. Conversation and discussion are central to the process. However, in a face-to-face context of learning, they are difficult to capture for later review or reflection as part of FA. This study investigates the role that technology might play in addressing this limitation using online PBL and FA in a media-creation course in a Thai university. Participants were undergraduate, pre-service teachers preparing to teach English as a foreign language. Objectives included the local design and implementation of online PBL and FA; identification of pre-service teachers' (n = 28) post-implementation perceptions of the convenience, benefits and barriers of this form of learning; perceptions of their PBL skills and; post-implementation measures of PBL knowledge and skills compared with learners participating in a face-to-face section of the course (n = 30). Results revealed that the technology provided a foundational scaffold to support both the learners' and the instructor's activity and interaction. The design of a simple learning management system with communication and file-sharing tools supported not only the learners, but the instructor, not only the assessment, but the learning. Learners' perceptions were positive and post-implementation measures of PBL knowledge and skill were significantly higher for the online section.

TI  - Project-based Learning in College English Instruction
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE SECOND NORTHEAST ASIA INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON LANGUAGE, LITERATURE AND TRANSLATION
CP  - 2nd Northeast Asia International Symposium on Language, Literature and Translation
AB  - With the development of curriculum, project-based learning (PBL), which started from the medical field, began to be applied to more content-based courses and is attracting the concern of EFL practitioners and researchers. Former studies all demonstrate the value of PBL in the overall development of students, but little research is conducted in college English instruction in China. This paper presents a three-semester study which demonstrated the feasibility of PBL in college English instruction. The study also reveals the contradiction between PBL and the current course evaluation, especially the testing system in colleges and universities in China. PBL calls for an all-round innovation from course evaluation, learning assessment, teaching approaches to course-book compilation in order to satisfy the needs of society for English.

TI  - FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT METHOD FOR PROJECT BASED LEARNING IN SPANISH ENGINEERING STUDIES
T2  - 4TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED 2010)
CP  - 4th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)
AB  - When Project Based Learning (PBL) was first implemented in the third year of studies of Technical Architecture at the Universitet Jaume I, the number of students per instructor was over 60 and the number of projects to correct per instructor was over 15. This caused some rejection among instructors since the required formative evaluation involved significantly higher workload than the traditional summative evaluation of the outcomes. Therefore, the required change for instructors to succeed in the implementation of this new methodology is not only regarding project definition, but also regarding assessment methods. In this paper, a new assessment method is defined to be used in the future in the Building Engineering degree, where PBL will be compulsory according to the new curricula adapted to the Bologna declaration. The methodology proposed is based on collaborative assessment evaluation methods.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 7TH CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING EDUCATION PRACTICE, CEP 2023
CP  - 7th Conference on Computing Education Practice (CEP)
AB  - Being an effective data scientist includes mastering many skills, both technical and analytical. There are many great teaching resources for learning technical skills. However, the analytical skills of understanding customer values, proposing causal relationships and gathering datasets are less common. This paper describes a new data science course designed to emphasize these analytical skills using individual project-based learning (PBL). PBL is considered to be a valuable teaching approach in computer science education. However, such courses typically have large-scale cohorts, resulting in PBL being used as group work. Our approach using individual PBL, circumvents issues concerning team dynamics and individual student assessment within group work. This course is designed to work for a large-scale (75+) postgraduate cohort of both full- and part-time students. To facilitate the large-scale cohort the course makes use of a virtual learning environment (VLE) and recorded lectures. Students were able to choose the subject of their project and what software they would use to create visualizations. This paper provides details of a novel approach to teaching data science using individual PBL for a large-scale cohort while maintaining education quality.

TI  - Beyond measure: using cogenerative dialogues as a formative assessment to improve PBL science internships
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION PART B-COMMUNICATION AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
AB  - Project-based learning has been suggested as an effective student-centered practice to teach science. However, how to assess students' learning in project-based learning activities remains challenging because of its open-ended nature. In this study of high school students' science internships, we demonstrated that cogenerative dialogs can serve as a formative assessment to improve teaching and learning in project-based teaming activities. Cogenerative dialogs provided a safe and supportive space for respectful and equitable dialogs. In cogenerative dialogs, both instructors and students identified areas for improvements and brainstormed solutions as a team. As a result, students were empowered to speak up their voices and willing to take on the responsibility for their learning. The regular cogenerative dialogs became an effective form of formative assessments to improve both the teaching and learning involved in the science internships. By analyzing these cogenerative dialogs, we identified eight key strategies used by participants in cogenerative dialogs to justify and assess the internship teaching and learning. These key strategies may serve as a framework to observe how instruction revolutions and feedback are intertwined and how students become engaged in assessing themselves and their peers in formative assessments.

TI  - Project based learning (PBL): Assessment from the Perspective of Primary Level Students
T2  - RIE-REVISTA DE INVESTIGACION EDUCATIVA
AB  - Given the consolidation of project based learning (PBL) and its ever more frequent use in schools as a mechanism to develop curricular competences, increase student motivation and self-esteem, foster research and promote collaboration (Railsback, 2002), we designed an assessment scale for project based learning from the perspective of the students, guaranteeing its validity and reliability. The scale was administered to 364 students of Primary Education to analyze the results of different collaborative learning projects and to see whether there were differences in the assessments in terms of gender and type of project. Among the main results it can be highlighted that in students' opinion, the projects proposed in class were well-organized, the tasks were well-defined, and the group size were adequate; moreover, the teachers provided the necessary help and feedback regarding the students' achievements while they stimulated student interaction and collaborative learning in which a good working climate was shared and fostered. Inferential analyses showed that there were significant differences in terms of project type, but not as a function of gender.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
AB  - Project based learning (PBL) fully engages students in the subject area, promotes teamwork, transdisciplinary collaboration, allows student teams to engage and solve community design problems and can ultimately lead to broader student worldviews. PBL, however, presents significant curricular challenges, including project definition and meaningful student assessment.
   The authors began the process of exploring PBL through a National Science Foundation Transformation Undergraduate Education in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (TUES) award. The program was piloted for two semesters under the TUES award and has now completed its eighth semester overall operating as a special curricular track in parallel with an existing, traditional curricular program in Building Science. With four years of dedicated PBL program experience to inform their efforts, the authors are currently reworking the existing Building Science program curriculum to fully integrate a PBL capstone during the senior year while establishing a clear curricular path, creating a sound base of projects, and maintaining resource limits that include, but are not limited to, facilities, materials and personnel.
   In this paper, the authors discuss their successes and difficulties with implementing PBL in an undergraduate design and construction program by reviewing twelve years of both spontaneous and planned project based PBL experiences in an undergraduate design and construction program.

AB  - The 3rd year Electrical Engineering Design Studio (EEDS) course is a project-based learning (PBL) course that gives students hands-on experience with putting electrical engineering principles into practice. It is an electro-mechanical project which provides a particular challenge since electrical engineering students often lack mechanical design skills. It is found here that learning outcomes are improved by a 2-stage formative assessment and time optimization strategy that allows students to extract as much value as possible out of the limited time they have to devote to this exercise. It consists of an innovative assessment strategy that includes formal, informal and self assessments, and an innovative budgeting, lecture scheduling, parts distribution, and order queueing system. The impact on efficiency is shown through an end-of-term student survey and a subjective evaluation of their work, in comparison to the previous year.

AB  - Software engineers must be able to manage complex projects, so that skills such as teamwork, leadership or initiative are critical to their successful development. Because of this, it is fundamental that the learning of software engineering as an academic discipline provides solid links between theory and practice. Educational frameworks such as those derived from the European Higher Education Area state that student-centered approaches are a useful tool for achieving these objectives. In this context, we present a project-based learning (PBL) experience report in a software engineering program of a Spanish university. The experience is based on the formation of small heterogeneous teams, which face the initial phases of a software methodology during the development of a project close to a real one. Through a strategy of role rotation and documentation transfer, all students perform different tasks and face different challenges throughout the project. Summative assessment is also adopted, considering not only teacher ratings but also students' peer assessment. The results prove the positive effect of using PBL to improve the training of students in acquiring different skills as future software engineers.

TI  - Harnessing Generative AI to Enhance Feedback Quality in Peer Evaluations within Project-Based Learning Contexts
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
AB  - This paper explores using generative artificial intelligence (AI) large language models (LLMs) to augment traditional peer feedback processes within project-based learning (PBL) environments where students work in teams. Our study contributes to the expanding digital educational frontier by harnessing the power of LLMs for summarizing and enhancing self and peer feedback. We present a novel educational innovation that utilizes GPT-4 to effectively summarize self and peer comments for student teams in PBL courses. Our research involved the development of a specific prompt grounded in relevant educational theories and the analysis of 118 AI-summarized Performance Feedback Reports that were generated for students. The findings reveal that the LLM significantly improves the quality of peer feedback by making it more constructive and actionable, addresses off-topic or inappropriate comments, and provides a meaningful comparison between a student's self-evaluation and peer comments. Our paper underscores the importance of peer feedback systems as valuable pedagogical tools in PBL classes and demonstrates how AI tools can enhance these systems. The outcomes of this research serve as a foundational guide for faculty, especially those teaching in PBL environments with student teams, who are considering using AI to enhance teaching and learning. We demonstrate the potential of integrating these innovative practices in PBL classrooms to support students' development of teamwork skills, marking a significant step towards a new digital frontier in engineering education.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOBILE LEARNING AND ORGANISATION
AB  - The classroom based applied-research explores a shift towards technology-enabled formative and summative project-based assessments as a replacement to campus-based assessments conducted in the context of polytechnics in Singapore. The investigation focuses how the integration of technology contributes to the development of attributes or learner profiles suitable for workplace and real-world performance while meeting the skill-based learning outcomes. Two scenarios have been addressed: student-generated video creation as summative assessment for full-time pre-employment training (PET) students and the application of student response system (SRS) for case-based formative tasks using a shared digital wall for part-time continuing education and training (CET) students who are adult learners. The qualitative study uses a hermeneutic phenomenology coupled with a quantitative survey to ensure valid interpretation of student feedback. While video-enabled summative assessment helped develop transferable soft-skills amongst tertiary students, the application of a shared SRS revealed higher intrinsic motivation towards life-long learning among adult learners.

CP  - 3rd International Conference on Education (ICEDU)
AB  - Based on the legislation in Indonesia, the required competences of teachers in Indonesia include pedagogical, professional, social, and personality. As one of teacher candidate education institution, Chemistry Education Department, Islamic University of Indonesia contribute to produce competent teacher candidates. The department has developed course materials, learning strategies; system-oriented evaluation to develop student competence as chemistry teacher candidates. Project Based Learning (PBL) is an option that is applied to achieve these objectives. This study aims to describe the implementation of PBL towards the attainment of teacher candidates. Subjects were students of chemistry education level three in academic years of 2016/2017. The research instruments include project assessment, competency tests, observation sheets, and student satisfaction questionnaire. Learning is conducted in accordance with the stages in the PBL such as: start with the essential question, design a plan, create a schedule, monitor, and assess the outcome.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate how peer assessment may support the student evaluation process through the various project elaboration phases. To this end, MyProject, a project-based learning environment that aims to support learners throughout the life cycle of a project, has been extended with: a) a peer review process for the project final deliverables; b) a mechanism allowing the provision of peer feedback in the form of agreement, disagreement or neutral. The literature review conducted to support this upgrade of MyProject concerned related work both on project-based learning and peer review systems. The empirical study conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the peer assessment functionalities of MyProject revealed that only a small sample of correct initial solutions may positively influence students' final deliverables through the peer review process. Students were also interested in having access to their peers' ideas although they do not spend much time in offering feedback.

TI  - Implementation of Project Based Learning: Lessons Learned
T2  - 2019 XLV LATIN AMERICAN COMPUTING CONFERENCE (CLEI 2019)
CP  - 45th Latin American Computing Conference (CLEI)
AB  - Project Based Learning (PBL) is a teaching and learning methodology where students develop projects under real conditions to acquire the knowledge and develop the skills required for their profession. In this article we discuss the lessons learned from two teachers who implemented different PBL approaches in three courses from the Bachelor in Computer and Informatics at the University of Costa Rica, during three semesters. We discuss the main considerations and decisions associated to project design elements and teaching practices. Among the main benefits identified by teachers when using PBL are the high motivation of students and the natural development of soft skills. Among the greatest challenges are (1) the design of learning assessment, considering technical aspects, soft skills, self- and peer- evaluations; (2) continuous feedback to students on their progress in the project and in team dynamics (and its consequent time investment); and (3) the necessary balance between designing a challenging and realistic project that enables the achievement of the course's learning objectives. We recommend the use of agile methodologies such as Scrum, which align very well with PBL principles, as well as the use of hybrid PBL methodologies, which include complementary didactic strategies to achieve the learning objectives of the course.

TI  - Evaluating Individual Contributions in Teams for Project-Based Learning in Data Science
T2  - 2024 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE, FIE
CP  - 2024 Frontiers in Education Conference
AB  - In this Innovative-Practice Full Paper, we present the design and implementation of a novel strategy for the assessment of the individual contributions of students working in teams for an interdisciplinary project-based learning (PBL) course. Team-based and project-based learning have been the cornerstones of experiential learning in recent years. In such courses, the assessment of students is often performed solely at a team level, resulting in student discontent, concerns about fairness, and social loafing. The application of a single method for evaluating individual contributions has its shortcomings, prompting us to incorporate a combination of evidence-based approaches. Thus, to mitigate these problems, we developed an assessment strategy that involves three components - self and peer evaluation (SPA), instructor's evaluation of individual contribution, and class participation. Anonymized SPA was carried out at three different checkpoints over the semester for both formative and summative assessment. The individual contribution of the students is also evaluated by the instructor and/or other mentors based on their interactions with all the students in the team over the entire semester. Class participation is another component of individual contribution incorporated in our scheme, where instructors evaluate the participation of individual students in classroom activities, presentations, and meetings. We collected feedback about the perception of students towards our assessment policies for individual contribution. We observed overall satisfaction and positive attitudes toward our scheme. We noted positive student perceptions of fairness in grading through our scheme and reduced chances of social loafing. Further, in the feedback, the students noted the effectiveness of using SPA as an evaluation tool, the usefulness of instructor's evaluation, and the role of class participation in creating a more engaging classroom and a more enriching experience. We also emphasize the need to set clear expectations for students with regard to the grading policies early in the semester. Finally, we discuss our experiences in implementing our design and recommendations for incorporating our grading scheme in team-based PBL courses.

TI  - A proposal of formative assessment for Project Based Learning in mathematics
T2  - INVESTIGACION EN EDUCACION MATEMATICA XX
CP  - 20th Annual Symposium of the Spanish-Society-of-Research-in-Mathematical-Education (SEIEM)
AB  - Nowadays, socio-constructivist approaches to mathematics teaching and learning need assessment procedures which are coherent with this vision. A proposal for articulating formative assessment is presented aimed at adapting to the progress and needs of secondary students that use Project Based Learning methodology. By means of a teaching experiment, carried out at a mathematics class of 2nd level of CSE, a procedure for sharing learning goals with students is implemented, together with a "traffic lights" system that allows students' self-assessment throughout the project and teacher 's provision of continuous feedback. Results show the usefulness of the system for students, by allowing them to know the learning goals and to work on their weak points, which entails a significant improvement in their academic results. It also serves the teacher for a systematic planning of tasks and of appropriate tools for providing feedback and help to the students.

AB  - In this paper we show the results of the implementation of the Project Based Learning (PBL) in Power Electronics subject with a large group of students. This case study with more than sixty students, has highlighted some areas that will require further development of the PBL methodology: firstly, the management of classroom, laboratory and off-campus time, the students perception of the efficient and productive use of this time, and the improvement in the use of teacher and student time; secondly, the combination of the theoretical knowledge applied in the developed project with the essential knowledge for final exams as a required part of students final assessment; and lastly, the individual student assessment reflecting the students work and learning in the subject. The aim of the project has been to integrate different tools, involved in the learning process, into a compact scenario based on real applications, as applied to the power electronic field. The analysis of students' opinion surveys during the last two years and the comparison of academic results over the last five years combined with the teachers experience during this time, show an encouraging scenario that will be improved for further development of the PBL methodology.

T2  - COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION
AB  - This paper presents the fusion of project-based learning (PBL) and collaborative learning (CL) cohesively, coordinated with sensors and Bluetooth advancements, open-source programming, and open-source equipment devices, in a specific microcontroller and installed frameworks designing apply autonomy course for the elementary learners. The major purpose of this study is to evaluate the significance of integrating PBL and CL. The course creates capacities and abilities in critical thinking, problem-solving, independent learning, collaboration, and specialized technical information. Since PBL alone does not guarantee profoundly talented cooperation, it was supplemented with CL. This structure coordinated course substance and understudy pragmatic accomplishment in a reenacted learning environment. The understudies built a line following and Bluetooth-controlled robots by actualizing control programming on the "Arduino" open-source platform, just as utilizing remote interchanges as Arduino offers an instinctive advancement condition and different equipment and programming resources that permit quick improvement of microcontroller-based ventures. The basic findings of this study work reveal that teaching, learning, and student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL when integrated with CL. The research successfully extends onto another group of learners for preparing similar gadgets under different timelines. In addition, this paper also discusses upon the problem identification, selection of the equipment, circuit design, hardware mounting, and critical analysis of the results acquired from the course through the personal learning experience of the teachers as well as in the form of feedback from the two groups of young learners.

AB  - Implementation of PBL (Project Based Learning) is important for engineering education. However, PBL programs have the problem that it is difficult for teachers to manage class and to set the standard for student evaluation. Furthermore, students' problem-solving conclusions may be weak and may not have educational effects. To solve these problems, project themes were limited to one set by the company. Furthermore, in order to improve the level of problem solving for students, the project aims to design products as an outcome of problem solving. After the project, about 60% to 90% of the students felt that the 12 abilities defined by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in the "Fundamental Competencies for Working Persons" improved their abilities. This paper describes the development project of paper toys and paper crafts using special stickers that can be freely attached and removed as many times as possible, by 4th grade students of Kanazawa International College of Technology, and its educational effects.

TI  - Does Project-Based Learning (PBL) Promote Student Learning? A Performance Evaluation
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - The purpose of the study on which this paper is based was to conduct a performance evaluation of student learning for an introductory course in project management in a higher educational institution in Norway. This was done by utilizing performance measurement philosophy to evaluate perceived student learning after a project-based assignment was applied as an instructional tool. The evaluation was conducted at the end of the semester to determine whether it facilitated learning effectiveness by providing an authentic learning experience. Relevant learning criteria were identified from existing literature and were measured by means of a questionnaire survey. Ten measurement scales were established using a 5-point Likert scale. The survey was then rolled out for the same subject for two consecutive semesters for just over 100 project management students. The results indicated that the incorporation of project-based assignments has a positive impact on student learning, motivation, and performance both in the short and long term. The study finally revealed that the incorporation of project-based assignments enables the creation of real-life experiences, which further stimulates the creation and development of real-life competencies.

TI  - Continued Multidisciplinary Project-based Learning - Implementation in Health Informatics
T2  - METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives: Problem- and project-based learning are approved methods to train students, graduates and post-graduates in scientific and other professional skills. The students are trained on realistic scenarios in a broader context. For students specializing in health informatics we introduced continued multidisciplinary project-based learning (CM-PBL) at a department of medical informatics. The training approach addresses both students of medicine and students of computer science.
   Methods: The students are full members of an ongoing research project and develop a project-related application or module, or explore or evaluate a sub-project. Two teachers guide and review the students' work. The training on scientific work follows a workflow with defined milestones. The team acts as peer group. By participating in the research team's work the students are trained on professional skills.
   Results: A research project on a web-based information system on hospitals built the scenario for the realistic context. The research team consisted of up to 14 active members at a time, who were scientists and students of computer science and medicine. The well communicated educational approach and team policy fostered the participation of the students. Formative assessment and evaluation showed a considerable improvement of the students' skills and a high participant satisfaction.
   Conclusions: Alternative education approaches such as project-based learning empower students to acquire scientific knowledge and professional skills, especially the ability of life-long learning, multidisciplinary team work and social responsibility.

T2  - 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES (EDULEARN17)
CP  - 9th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN)
AB  - The final year of the Bachelor of Aerospace Engineering agree at RMIT University includes a capstone aerospace design project involving student teams working together to develop a concept solution to a given requirement. Project-based learning (PBL) is an important part of engineering education where student teams work together to achieve a common objective and acquire a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world challenges and problems. In industry, engineering projects are a collaborative effort of a team of professional engineers, managers, regulators, finance officers, etc. and by replicating this environment in education students learn how to work with fellow students, who have different skills, abilities, motivation, enthusiasm, work ethics and drive, to solve a real-world problem. Although it is generally accepted that this experience is very valuable in preparing students for the workplace, the challenge from a course coordinator's perspective is how to manage these groups and how to determine a transparent and fair assessment scheme. This paper introduces some of the challenges of individual student assessment in group projects and will give an overview of some of the techniques applied in tertiary education, supported by the experiences at RMIT University with the capstone aircraft design project.

AB  - A lot of engineering programs in universities are designed according with international standards. Associations like IEEE, AIM, AIS and organizations like ABET [2] and ASIIN [3] among others, define characteristics and skills related to team working, multidisciplinary issues and collaborative tasks. Institutions that want to measure these abilities, often work with project-based learning (PBL), a pedagogical strategy that eases the creation of multidisciplinary spaces, where the students participate with their abilities and knowledge. However, some classroom projects present challenges as:(i) planning of schedule considering the time required for developing a solution, against the time needed for getting the knowledge to develop it, (ii) student awareness of the impact that the solution has in the problem domain and (iii) commitment of students with projects that last for more than one semester.
   This paper presents Citizen Science projects as an alternative to solve such problems along with the participation of different specialists, disciplines, roles (citizens and scientific) and mechanisms of collaboration. This pedagogical strategy has been developed within a course in software engineering, measured with a formative assessment and compared with another project in the traditional customer-supplier schema.

T2  - 32ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, ICCE 2024, VOL I
CP  - 32nd International Conference on Computers in Education
AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore the value of AI-assisted project-based learning design in Chinese language education. Through instructional design that integrates foreign language, cross-cultural understanding, and multimedia expression, we aim to enhance learners' proactive attitudes and improve learning outcomes using AI and ICT. Conducted the tourism Chinese course at a Japanese university, the research employed mixed methods to assess the effectiveness of integrated PBL. The course utilized AI and ICT tools such as an online whiteboard, a pronunciation practice tool, generative AI for writing assistance, and a video editing application. Data from student surveys, feedback, and teacher observations indicated that approximately half of the students found the AI-supported PBL effective for their learning needs, especially in pronunciation practice and video editing, though it didn't fully address speaking skill inaccuracies. AI and ICT tools were effective in supporting cultural knowledge and intercultural communication skills, but student evaluation of AI's impact on learning were polarized. The value of the CFL approach using AI and ICT was discovered in creating immersive, adaptive learning environments-a value that had gone unnoticed in traditional teaching and learning methods-while also underscoring the need for proper support and training from teachers. Future challenges include integrating AI literacy into language courses and addressing varying technological proficiency levels among students.

T2  - TECHNOLOGY PEDAGOGY AND EDUCATION
AB  - The effects of teachers' audio feedback on students' project-based learning and its influencing factors have seldom been empirically explored in the higher education context. To address this research gap, a group of Hong Kong freshmen (18-23 years old) and their teachers were involved in this study. Data were collected from students' retrospective journals, post-journal interviews and teacher interviews after the participants experienced audio feedback during their group projects in a General Education course. The findings demonstrated that teachers' audio feedback enhanced students' learning engagement, critical thinking and project output. The students also reported that audio feedback provided convenience, timeliness, rich information, asynchronous discussion and social presence. Other factors including the features of audio feedback, communication between student and teacher on the received feedback and their learning motivation were also crucial in determining the effects of audio feedback on student project-based learning.

TI  - Integration of different assessment approaches: application to a project-based learning engineering course
T2  - EDUCATION FOR CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
AB  - Formative assessment and self-, peer- and co-evaluation strategies for assessing students' learning have been developed and applied, over two academic years, to 75 students on a project-based learning course in the Chemical Engineering Degree at Cantabria University (Spain). The project proposed for teamwork learning in the Process Design course was the preliminary design of a second-generation bioethanol plant. Rubrics of formative assessment and evaluation generated positive reinforcement for the student advancing through the consecutive learning stages. The negotiated co-evaluation process has proved to be an effective tool for reflecting the distinctive contributions of each working group member, which are then successfully incorporated in the final individual mark set by the teachers. Students' perceptions regarding the proposed assessment approaches have been obtained by creating and applying an anonymous and voluntary survey instrument. The active participation of the students in the design and application of rubrics using specific criteria is proposed for peer-assessment processes in learning activities with high qualitative content and more susceptible to subjective capabilities such as oral presentations. We consider that the assessment, learning methodology and the experience gained with the survey results contribute to enhanced achievement of the learning outcomes, and to enhanced quality in the teaching-learning process.

TI  - Gaining Student Engagement Through Project-Based Learning: A Competitive 2D Game Construction Case Study
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - In this work we consider an open artificial intelligence game as a matter of study within the lectures of artificial intelligence to combat lack of motivation and increase engagement within the classroom. During formation, students in computer science can deal with moderately complex projects, nevertheless, dealing with such problems is relegated to the Degree Final Project. In this investigation we show the procedural steps of how project-based learning combined with game construction can effectively be used to promote engagement in informatic lectures at university. For the task, we build a 2D game engine and propose students to enroll in factitious research teams with the aim of programming intelligent agents that play the game employing artificial intelligence techniques. The intended principal outcome is to show evidence of the application of project-based learning in artificial intelligence within the lectures, and how it can be combined with game construction to increase motivation in the classroom. Project-based learning has the students learn, organize, and solve challenges while students themselves remain their own responsible for the investigation and process of work. We propose to follow a series of sequential phases that conform a set of milestones that incorporate a project-based learning approach to the lectures. Through this work we show that the use of project-based learning combined with game construction provides reliable evidence that a much deeper understanding about artificial intelligence is attained by students participating in the challenge. Student evaluation questionnaires and final grade results attained by students indicate that students remained more engaged during the semester in comparison to previous semesters in which lack of motivation was reported.

TI  - Promote healthy living and well-being with the use of project-based learning collaboratively between subjects
T2  - RETOS-NUEVAS TENDENCIAS EN EDUCACION FISICA DEPORTE Y RECREACION
AB  - In Chile, the study plans and programs are oriented to the traditional model of education, despite this, the Ministry of Education promotes that the establishments work in a collaborative and interdisciplinary way, through guidelines, which recommend the use of active methodologies such as Project-Based Learning (PBL). For these reasons, the objective of this experience is to present an interdisciplinary classroom project whose theme is: physical activity and healthy eating and the final product is the creation of a recipe book of medicinal herbs. To implement it, the teachers have worked collaboratively between all the subjects based on a planning focused on the sixth grade of a rural establishment, with the main subjects being: Physical Education and Health and Natural Sciences. Based on the theme: active and healthy life and through the interests of the students, they have developed the project using formative assessment to grade the experience. This has represented the common work between the teachers and offers an opportunity for the use of Project-Based Learning in the Chilean educational system. However, it is noted that the study programs do not present information on the use of these active methodologies.

TI  - Decision making in the assessment of project-based learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - The Project-based learning is an active learning method, based on student's group work, in order to develop skills, and to acquire knowledge. The development of ICT has enabled the implementation of processes of this educational approach. Indeed, the assessment process is a fundamental process in the learning cycle, and represents a means of regulation and control for tutors and learners. However, the assessment process requires points of decision-making, at the individual and the group level. Our approach in this paper is to treat the decision making through (Analytical Hierarchical process) hierarchical analysis method, for the formative assessment. The Analytic Hierarchy Process structures the assessment criteria and enables an optimization of the decision.

TI  - Monitoring Student Performance Through an Agile Project-Based Assessment Strategy for Distance Higher Education
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTANCE EDUCATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - This article presents an observational qualitative study regarding the use of agile methodologies in implementing project-based student assessment procedures in higher education courses. The study comprised 32 students enrolled in an online biology class in a public university in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Students underwent two types of activities: first using traditional project-based learning, second using an agile approach based on the EduScum methodology. Results demonstrated that the agile methodology enforced student engagement, especially collaboration aspects. Interactions between students and teachers became more acute and straightforward. Moreover, it became easier for teachers to monitor students' performance throughout the course. This study provides highlights to enable schools to improve students' assessment procedures in distance education courses.

TI  - Undertaking Educational Research Following the Introduction, Implementation, Evolution, and Hybridization of Constructivist Instructional Models in an Australian PBL High School
T2  - INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL OF PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING
AB  - The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the introduction, implementation, evolution, hybridization, and initial research into the constructivist instructional models deployed within a secondary (high) school in Australia. A concomitant aim is to relate some of the consequences of whole school pedagogical change, which have included the implementation of project-and problem-based learning, the flipped classroom, and a derivative hybridized form, referred to here as "flipped PBL." Moreover, after a decade of using constructivist approaches, we initiated educational research to better understand some of the effects of these changes and to explore the reasons behind the successful implementation of the models. While still in its infancy, the nature of this research and some of the preliminary findings are detailed here.

TI  - Project-Based Learning Applied to Unmanned Aerial Systems and Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology and the miniaturization of sensors have changed the way remote sensing (RS) is used, popularizing this geoscientific discipline in other fields, such as precision agriculture. This makes it necessary to implement the use of these technologies in teaching RS alongside the classical platforms (satellite and manned aircraft). This manuscript describes how The Higher Technical School of Agricultural Engineering at the University of Cordoba (Spain) has introduced UAV RS into the academic program by way of project-based learning (PBL). It also presents the basic characteristics of PBL, the design of the subject, the description of the teacher-guided and self-directed activities, as well as the degree of student satisfaction. The teaching and learning objectives of the subject are to learn how to determine the vigor, temperature, and water stress of a crop through the use of RGB, multispectral, and thermographic sensors onboard a UAV platform. From the onset, students are motivated, actively participate in the tasks related to the realization of UAV flights, and subsequent processing and analysis of the registered images. Students report that PBL is more engaging and allows them to develop a better understanding of RS.

TI  - Formative Assessment in Project-based Learning: Supporting Alternative on the Learning Outcome of Biology Students in University
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOLOGY AND APPLIED SCIENCE (ICOBAS)
CP  - International Conference on Biology and Applied Science (ICOBAS)
AB  - The learning process in higher education is defined as active learning. Nonetheless, there are many learning practices that are oriented only toward mastering the cognitive aspect and only assess the cognitive aspect via paper and pencil test. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of formative assessment in project-based learning on the learning outcome of Biology Students. This study adopted a quasi-experimental pre-test and post-test control group design to examine the effect of formative assessment on the learning outcome. The samples were 120 Biology Education students from Universitas Negeri Malang and divided into two learning groups. The first learning group as control class and the second as experiment class. The instruments used to measure cognitive learning outcomes were 15 multiple choice questions and 5 essay questions. Data analyses were descriptive analysis and Covariate analysis. The results of the Covariate Analysis test calculations can be seen that F count is 17.456 and the probability value of the learning model is 0,000 or less than 0.05. Formative assessment such as information literacy rubric is needed by students in helping the learning process of Biology students in higher education.

TI  - Advances in Designing a Student-Centered Learning Process using Cutting-Edge Methods, Tools, and Artificial Intelligence: An E-Learning Platform
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 1ST ACM SIGSOFT INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON EDUCATION THROUGH ADVANCED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (EASEAI '19)
CP  - 1st ACM SIGSOFT International Workshop on Education through Advanced Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (EASEAI)
AB  - It is well known the fact that learning process is difficult for learners and at the same time it raises problems for those who teach. Teaching Software Engineering for undergraduate students is an assiduous and a challenging task due to its level of abstraction, to frequently changes that appear in programming paradigms and in software development methodologies.
   In this paper we provide a novel approach in teaching Advanced Programming Methods, the third introductory course in Software Engineering that is being taught at our faculty within the Computer Science Curriculum for undergraduate students.
   The contribution of this paper is threefold: firstly, we design a student-centered learning process intertwining cutting edge methods like for instance project-based learning, self assessment-based learning and students engagement. Secondly, we design an E-learning platform to provide for students an automated assessment and appropriate feedback and, most important, to offer them support throughout the learning process. Thirdly, we provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis over 3 years of teaching Advanced Programming Methods course, by applying the proposed methodology.
   Our analysis results show the effectiveness of our approach. Key contributions in this paper are our proposed E-learning platform and the analysis findings.

TI  - Investigating the impact of teacher practices and noncognitive factors on mathematics achievement
T2  - RESEARCH IN EDUCATION
AB  - It is with increasing importance that mathematics education research considers the role of noncognitive motivation variables alongside elements of the classroom context in investigations of student mathematics performance. This study uses a hierarchical linear modeling framework to predict mathematics achievement from three classroom variables, project-based learning, group collaboration, and student-driven curriculum, and two noncognitive factors, mathematics anxiety and mathematics self-concept, utilizing data from the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) United States sample. Findings suggest that mathematics classroom contexts that are student-driven and integrate project-based learning positively impact mathematics achievement, and that both mathematics anxiety and mathematics self-concept contribute significantly towards explaining variation in mathematics achievement after accounting for gender, race, socioeconomic status, truancy, and school-level poverty.

TI  - PBL Intervention for Fostering Creativity in First-Year Engineering Students
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
AB  - Contribution: This research presents a project-based learning (PBL) approach for fostering creativity in first-year students with differential characteristics in the course execution. The first course considered remote teaching during a pandemic period; the second one used 50% of the weeks with remote teaching and the rest with face-to-face interaction.
   Background: Fostering creativity has become a significant challenge for engineering education. This work focuses on harmonizing a creativity framework and a PBL approach (PBL + C) as an alternative to motivate creative thinking.
   Intended Outcomes: The PBL + C approach can improve first-year engineering students' creativity and innovation skills and learning outcomes.
   Application Design: In the intervention, the project execution considers the creative process and its phases. Likewise, it takes all elements of an aligned curriculum model, such as teaching and learning activities, types of problems, project progression, support resources, creative tools, learning environments, facilitation strategies, and student assessment and course evaluation. Regarding the last elements, researchers define an assessing protocol, which involves pre-and post-tests, participant observation, analysis of student portfolios for monitoring the work progress, and specific questionnaires on variables related to the curricular design.
   Findings: Evidence collected shows an increase in creativity factors, such as fluency and flexibility, which are critical aspects of the "Person" element of the creative process. Likewise, the modality of the course (remote or in-person) influences the conditions for its development. For example, in the mixed course, researchers found that students had more interaction with each other, which is reflected in better elaborated solutions than in the remote teaching course.

TI  - ENHANCING SCIENCE TEACHERS' SCIENCE PROCESS SKILLS USING TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN INTERDISCIPLINARY PROJECT-BASED LEARNING
T2  - INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS
AB  - Recognizing the necessity for robust Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programs, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) recommended such initiatives in light of the 2022 results to improve the quality of science education. This study responds to that need by assessing the effectiveness of a CPD program aimed at technology-driven, interdisciplinary project-based learning (PBL) to enhance the science process skills of in-service science teachers in the Kashkadardya Region of Uzbekistan. The research employed a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design. The study unfolded in two phases using this design. The quantitative phase involved pre-tests and post-tests, while the qualitative design incorporated phenomenology. Results from the quantitative phase indicated a significant improvement in teachers' science process skills, evidenced by paired t-test results and a notable effect size, confirming the enhancement of these skills. The qualitative findings revealed three primary themes: the seamless integration of scientific practices into PBL, fostering supportive collaboration and teamwork, and the augmented ability of teachers to deliver effective science education. Employing tools like Canva, menti.com, and YouTube within the CPD program proved beneficial for promoting experiential learning, creative engagement, and collaborative problem-solving. These findings emphasize the importance of integrating science process skills within interdisciplinary and inquiry based frameworks that encourage critical thinking and real-world applications. This research underscores the vital importance of CPD in advancing science education and urges policymakers and educational institutions to prioritize such programs. The CPD program can be implemented in other regions of Uzbekistan and around the world to strengthen science teachers' process skills. Various educational institutions can adopt the CPD framework and incorporate it into their future in-service training programs.

TI  - The Community of Inquiry Perspective on Teachers? Role and Students? Evaluations of Online Project-Based Learning
T2  - ONLINE LEARNING
AB  - The role of teachers is an important element of online project-based learning courses. Based on the Community of Inquiry framework, this study examined how students' perceptions of teaching presence, through social presence and cognitive presence, were related to their evaluations of online project-based learning. A 16-week online project-based legal education course was implemented. During the course, students engaged in two small group activities and created two final products. Survey data were collected twice from 38 and 41 students in two course phases. Results from partial least squares analyses revealed that teaching presence was directly related to students' evaluations in the early stage of the course and indirectly related to students' evaluations, through the effects of social presence, in the entire course. Practical implications for teachers and suggestions for further studies are provided.

AB  - In the recent years technology education has gained importance worldwide. Colombian government has included it in the basic and secondary schools curriculum, but the current teaching-learning strategies and the resources used for technology class have proven to be insufficient. This paper presents a case study for implementing Project-Based learning in a Colombian high school, using Open source Hardware and Software. First, a set of technological competencies are defined for technology class, based on the suggestions of the Ministry of National Education. Then, a project for designing an irrigation system for the school orchard is presented, which will engage students to develop the selected technological competencies. Subsequently, a set of didactic tools for the project are presented, including an electronic platform for the control of the water flux in the irrigation system. The project will be implemented during the following months, and through diagnostic and summative assessment it is expected to measure the improvement of the technological competencies in students.

TI  - The light applications in science and engineering research collaborative undergraduate laboratory for teaching (LASER CULT) - Relevant experiential learning in photonics
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
AB  - An integrative undergraduate photonics curriculum has been developed that utilizes three active learning methods: case studies, team learning, and project-based learning (PBL). This two-course sequence at Oklahoma State University's Light Applications in Science and Engineering Research Collaborative Undergraduate Laboratory for Teaching (LASER CULT), is designed as an introduction to optics and photonics for electrical engineering students. The LASER CULT has three primary goals: make course concepts more relevant to students, provide students with training and positive experiences in functioning on a team, and introduce in-depth projects that require higher level problem-solving skills, such as evaluation and synthesis. To accomplish these goals, which are synergistic with Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) outcomes, LASER CULT courses use two in-depth design projects that are constructed by student teams under realistic constraints rather than focusing on hierarchical concepts. The relevance of course content to students is increased by recreating the environment of practicing engineers. Assessment data, measured through individual reflection included in team portfolios and student assessment of learning gains, demonstrate the effectiveness of this format for meeting course goals and ABET criteria and pipelining students into graduate school.

TI  - SELL IT: DESIGN PROJECT ASSESSMENT BY THE PUBLIC
T2  - BUILDING COMMUNITY: DESIGN EDUCATION FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE
CP  - 19th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education (E&PDE)
AB  - This investigation contributes to design assessment practice by examining how public assessment can enhance project-based learning.
   Project-based learning is designed to provide students with an opportunity to engage in authentic problem finding and solving. Students often become very involved with the specifics of their project without always noticing what they are learning. As such, it becomes essential to engage them in reflection during the process and at the completion of the project. A constellation of formative and summative assessment activities that include self, group, and instructor, can aid the learner in this contemplation.
   We propose that public assessment in the form of a student-run sale can provide distinctive feedback to students. Our experience with student-run retail sales over multiple years has lead us to identify some unique characteristics of this type of public assessment. These include a positive effect on student motivation, independent validation in a face-to-face setting, and providing direct consumer feedback to students. In this paper we discuss assessment practice as it relates to the sale and review student reflections on the experience to determine its usefulness.

TI  - FEEDBACK AND FEED-FORWARD FOR PROMOTING PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING IN ONLINE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS
T2  - MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF LEARNING & INSTRUCTION
AB  - Purpose - The study aimed to (1) review the literature to construct conceptual models that could guide instructional designers in developing problem/project-based learning environments while applying effective feedback strategies, (2) use the models to design, develop, and implement an online graduate course, and (3) assess the efficiency of the models.
   Method - Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered during the implementation of an online graduate-level course that was designed and developed using the two proposed conceptual models. Eleven students were enrolled in the course. Multiple sources of data and analytical strategies were used to collect, analyze, and interpret the data.
   Findings - The results show that the characteristics and strategies suggested in the proposed models supported student achievement in course projects and activities. The timely and frequent feedback allowed students to make necessary changes to their final project parts and improve performance. The motivating, informative/specific feedback and feed-forward goals appeared to provide a reference for areas of student improvement. A balance of the three types of feedback, along with metacognitive questioning, supported student improvement. Because the frequency of feedback was dependent upon student request, those who needed more frequent feedback during the acquisition of learning benefited from that, but those who did not need it received the moderate amount necessary to be successful.
   Significance - The study brings to light the importance of three types of formative feedback in problem or project-based learning. It offers two conceptual frameworks for instructional designers and curriculum developers. The models could be used to provide all forms of feedback including feed up, feedback and feed-forward to support student success in PBL learning environments.

TI  - Software for project-based learning of robot motion planning
T2  - COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION
AB  - Motion planning is a core problem in robotics concerned with finding feasible paths for a given robot. Motion planning algorithms perform a search in the high-dimensional continuous space of robot configurations and exemplify many of the core algorithmic concepts of search algorithms and associated data structures. Motion planning algorithms can be explained in a simplified two-dimensional setting, but this masks many of the subtleties and complexities of the underlying problem. We have developed software for project-based learning of motion planning that enables deep learning. The projects that we have developed allow advanced undergraduate students and graduate students to reflect on the performance of existing textbook algorithms and their own variations on such algorithms. Formative assessment has been conducted at three institutions. The core of the software used for this teaching module is also used within the Robot Operating System, a widely adopted platform by the robotics research community. This allows for transfer of knowledge and skills to robotics research projects involving a large variety robot hardware platforms.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION, 2011, VOL 5
CP  - ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE)
AB  - This paper describes an NSF funded project in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) Department at the University of Missouri. A primary goal of this project is to systematically increase project-based learning (PBL) experiences throughout the MAE curriculum.
   To accomplish this goal, recent capstone design projects that need further refinements serve as the basis for PBL activities throughout the MAE curriculum. A major tool for facilitating these refinement efforts is a new senior/graduate Design Management course in which each student in this course learns how to plan and manage design projects. These students then implement their learning by serving as project team managers in the courses in which the refinement activities are being conducted.
   This paper provides a detailed case study of five refinements to one capstone design that took place in four different MAE courses during the Spring 2011 semester. The paper describes a Fall 2009 capstone project that consisted of designing a portable wood chipper. The student design was very promising, leading to a chipper with significantly greater chipping capacity than commercially available chippers of the same size and weight. However, several faculty members reviewed the results and identified additional opportunities for refining the design. This paper describes activities during Spring 2011 when students in four different MAE courses developed refinements to the original design. The roles of the Design Management students in these activities are discussed. The paper also includes a discussion of the methods and findings of the formative assessment process, including interviews with, and surveys of, faculty and students.

TI  - Assessment of Students' Creative Thinking Skill on the Implementation of Project-Based Learning
T2  - IJOLE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE EDUCATION
AB  - The implementation of Merdeka Belajar - Kampus Merdeka (Freedom to Learn) in Indonesia urges universities to adapt and set changes in learning activities. One of the changes is the implementation of Project-Based Learning to increase students' activeness and creativity. This research aims to assess students' creative thinking skills on the implementation of Project-Based Learning. This research is a descriptive qualitative case study. Purposive sampling is chosen in this research because the sample is chosen on purpose, i.e., those who join literary criticism class. There are thirty-six students who played as the subject of the research. It uses observation sheets and questionnaires to obtain the data. The data are then analyzed to get reliable results of students' creative thinking assessment. The result shows that half of the students (50%) agree that they face some difficulties in developing their creative thinking. Most of their problems are developing ideas into coherence text, structuring or organizing a good text, and choosing appropriate vocabulary to avoid repetition in the text. Students also find that project-based learning allows them to develop their creative thinking. It can be seen from four main rubrics of creative thinking assessment in form of originality, fluency, flexibility, and elaboration. Regarding the result, it can be concluded that project-based learning is proven to be beneficial in developing students' creative thinking skills, though they find some obstacles during the process.

TI  - The effectiveness of project-based learning on students' academic achievement in emergency nursing study
T2  - HEALTHCARE IN LOW-RESOURCE SETTINGS
AB  - Projects necessitate students to choose and identify constructive models of investigation and materials while employing appropriate strategies for conducting learning activities. However, the effectiveness of such methods in the context of nursing-specific education has not been extensively explored. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of project-based learning in emergency and critical care nursing courses for nursing students. This study employed a pre-experimental design. The research sample consisted of 123 students enrolled in the emergency, critical, and disaster management nursing course at Universitas Jember. The research involved a comparison of students' learning outcomes through written test questions before and after they completed a project. The results of the learning assessment before and after the project intervention were analyzed using the Wilcoxon Test. The results of the bivariate obtained a significance value of 0.0001. The results of this statistical test can be concluded that the project-based learning method is effective in increasing the knowledge of emergency, critical and disaster nursing. The project-based learning method proves to be effective in enhancing students' comprehension of emergency, critical, and disaster nursing. Nursing educational institutions can consider the incorporation of this method in curriculum design to create more effective learning strategies. It serves as a promising alternative for enhancing the quality of nursing education. Further research is necessary to validate these findings and investigate various factors that may influence the effectiveness of project-based learning methods in the nursing context.

TI  - Scaffolding project-based learning with the project management body of knowledge (PMBOK®)
T2  - COMPUTERS & EDUCATION
AB  - This paper reports the results of a study of the extent to which processes and procedures from the discipline of project management can scaffold online project-based learning in a graduate-level instructional technology course, by facilitating intra-team interaction, enhancing project outcomes and promoting a positive project team experience. With one course section using tools and templates from project management and one section using only free-form text forms and instructor guidelines as project scaffolding tools, team interactions were compared via qualitative and quantitative analyses of team threaded discussions over an 8-week project lifecycle. Project outcomes were assessed by comparing project product scores using the t-test for independent samples, while project experience was assessed via a post-project survey using the University of Wisconsin-Madison Student Assessment of Learning Gains (SALG) questionnaire. Results indicate that the project management methodology facilitates intra-team communication and positive collaborative behavior, but is not a critical factor for final product quality. The results provide a starting point for educators and researchers seeking to assess cross-disciplinary approaches to project-based learning. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Multidisciplinary PBL Approach for Teaching Industrial Informatics and Robotics in Engineering
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
AB  - This paper describes the design of an industrial informatics course, following the project-based learning methodology, and reports the experience of four academic years (from 2012-13 to 2015-16). Industrial Informatics is a compulsory course taught in the third year of the B.Sc. degree in industrial electronics and automation engineering at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Spain. The course had students develop an embedded controller for a 2DoF SCARA robot that drew a specific trajectory. The robot was built with the LEGO Mindstorms kit and the controller was implemented with NXC, a C-like programming language for the NXT brick. In this activity, students became aware of their learning needs and had to work proactively, both autonomously and in teams. The course design achieved several objectives: 1) students learned the course material; 2) soft skills demanded by employers were reinforced; and 3) the material was structured into project tasks for students to perform. The article analyses two indicators: 1) qualification marks and 2) student satisfaction.

TI  - Enhancing engineering education using project-based learning for Lean and Six Sigma
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEAN SIX SIGMA
AB  - Purpose - The aim of this research is to determine the importance and impact of project-based learning (PBL) on students' knowledge in Lean and Six Sigma courses where practical application of theoretical knowledge is necessary.
   Design/methodology/approach - Students teams were given hands-on collaborative projects conducted with local companies. After the completion of the project, a student evaluation survey was conducted and the responses were analysed in two different phases. The first phase consisted of collecting responses from the Lean and Six Sigma courses; observing the impact of the semester project on students' knowledge based on the response percentages. The second phase analyses the responses from both the Lean and Six Sigma courses, by performing a Fisher's exact test to examine how similar the students received knowledge from the use of the semester project.
   Findings - Results showed that the inclusion of the semester project in the courses had a positive impact on the students' knowledge in learning course concepts and the students were able to apply theoretical knowledge in solving real-world problems. It is also observed that the response patterns are different in most of the aspects between both the courses.
   Research limitations/implications - This research evaluates student learning with statistical tests and is limited only for classroom teaching techniques. Further, this research states that application-oriented courses should be accompanied by projects as it helps in better understanding the course deliverables for the students.
   Originality/value - Research evaluating the impact of PBL on students' knowledge in Lean and Six Sigma courses does not currently exist. Statistical analysis of survey responses from both the Lean and Six Sigma courses was performed using a x(2) test of independence to examine how similar the students received knowledge from the use of the semester project.

TI  - Project-based learning methodology in the area of microbiology applied to undergraduate medical research
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - In the recent years, there has been a decrease in the number of medical professionals dedicated to a research career. There is evidence that students with a research experience during their training acquire knowledge and skills that increase the probability of getting involved in research more successfully. In the Degree of Medicine (University of the Basque Country) the annual core subject 'Research Project' introduces students to research. The aim of this work was to implement a project-based learning methodology, with the students working on microbiology, and to analyse its result along time. Given an initial scenario, the students had to come up with a research idea related to medical microbiology and to carry out a research project, including writing a funding proposal, developing the experimental assays and analyzing and presenting their results to a congress organized by the University. Summative assessment was performed by both students and teachers. A satisfaction survey was carried out to gather the students' opinion. The overall results regarding to the classroom dynamics, learning results and motivation after the implementation were favourable. Students referred a greater interest about research than they had before. They would choose the project based methodology versus the traditional one.

TI  - Project-Based Learning in Green Electrochemistry for Undergraduates: An Efficient Synthesis Route of a Natural Product
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION
AB  - Project-based learning is widely used in organic laboratories. This goal-oriented and inquiry-based learning model complements student-centered training. Such models focus on complicated issues or real-world problems on the frontier of chemistry. Students progress through three project phases: preproject, during the project, and postproject. Herein, we combined organic synthesis, electrochemistry, and green chemistry to improve students' understanding of organic reactions and mechanisms and exposed them to a new method of organic synthesis, which is electrochemistry. Moreover, we integrated the concept of green chemistry into the study of organic chemistry, and student assessment indicated substantial improvement in the understanding of this concept. Students designed a simple electrochemical reactor and accomplished the synthesis of (+/-)-muscone. Meanwhile, student competencies were comprehensively improved. The project included a literature review, experimental procedures, and essay writing. Overall, responses from students regarding the project experience were highly affirming.

TI  - CONTROL THEORY PRACTICES APPLIED TO TEACHING PRACTICAL CONTROL THEORY
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION, 2017, VOL 5
CP  - ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition
AB  - Control theory is useful in a broad range of diverse applications that include mechanical, electrical and chemical systems. This work extends the application of control theory from achieving a desired technical outcome to achieving a desired pedagogical outcome. In this paper, the desired outcome is the teaching and learning of applied control systems theory. In the proposed model, the student is the plant, their skill set is the set point, the instructor is the controller, and either an exardor a project-based-learning (PBL) course is the sensor. The PBL course is used to evaluate the actual skill set of the students and the difference between the actual and desired skill set (error signal) is fed back to the professor to initiate curricular changes. This model is shown to be applicable at various levels. At the micro level, examinations within a course are used to optimize that course. At the intermediate level, a PBL course is used as the sensor for a conventional lecture-based course. At the macro level, the departmental program as a whole is matched to the needs of industry in pursuit of a 100% employment rate of its students.

TI  - Leadership Growth Over Multiple Semesters in Project-Based Student Teams Embedded in Faculty Research (Vertically Integrated Projects)
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
AB  - Contribution: This longitudinal study modeled student leadership growth in a course sequence supporting long-term, large-scale, multidisciplinary projects embedded in faculty research. Students (half from computer science, computational media, electrical engineering, and computer engineering) participated for 1-4 semesters.Background: PBL is used widely in higher education. It is used in industry for leadership development, but leadership development in project-based learning (PBL) has not been explored in higher education. A preliminary analysis implied leadership growth through the third semester of participation, but the design did not control for attrition.Research Questions: At the student level, how do leadership role ratings change over multiple semesters of participation? Do first (and second) semester ratings differ by number of semesters students eventually participate?Methodology: The study involved two peer evaluation questions on 1) the degree to which students coordinated the team's work and 2) served as technical/content area leaders. Analysis employed analysis of variance to examine attrition by initial ratings (N = 1045) and multilevel growth modeling to study change over time (N = 585). A strength of using peer evaluations is the large sample size, but a weakness is that the tool was developed for student assessment and not educational research. The study did not control for participation in leadership programs outside the course.Findings: On average, individual leadership role ratings increased each semester through the third semester of participation. Ratings of students who left the program after 1 or 2 semesters did not differ from ratings for those who participated longer.

CP  - 13th International Conference on Interactive Mobile Communication, Technologies and Learning (IMCL)
AB  - This paper is a case study which discusses the development and the use of rubrics as means of assessing students in STEM project-based learning activities. The context of the case study involves the pilot phase of the STEMFREAK program, an out-of-school educational program which engaged students in such projects. The aim of the paper is twofold: 1) to present the systematic process that was employed for the design, development and application of rubrics and 2) to assess the effectiveness of the STEMFREAK program which, following the principle of constructive alignment between learning design and assessment strategy, was designed to develop the students' competencies that the rubrics assess. The design and the development of the rubrics took place following an iterative and participatory approach, whereas their application engaged 15 students in STEM projects. The students were assessed using the ensuing rubrics in a pre-post single group research design. The results showed that all students made statistically significant progress in all aspects of their performance, as assessed by the rubrics made. The case study has the potential of informing future approaches towards the assessment of students in projects that cater for STEM project-based learning with young learners.

TI  - Examining the Impact of Project-Based Learning on Students' Self-Reported and Actual Learning Outcomes
T2  - PEDAGOGY IN HEALTH PROMOTION
AB  - Active, collaborative, and project-based learning strategies have become increasingly popular in college classrooms due to their effectiveness in cultivating student-centered learning. Compared to conventional teaching methods, active and project-based learning engages students in the learning process by fostering collaborative approaches to addressing real-world problems. To better prepare students for future careers in health promotion, we evaluated the effectiveness of a collaborative project-based health promotion assignment on self-perceived and actual learning among a sample of underrepresented students (N = 33). In order to assess learning, students completed both a self-reported and actual learning assessment designed to assess competency of the core learning outcomes of the health promotion course. Results demonstrated approximately similar increases in self-reported and actual learning over the semester. Although the results were unexpectedly parallel, students consistently underestimated their knowledge on both the pre- and post-learning assessments. In all, survey results demonstrated the group-based project served as a valuable tool for undergraduate learning, with the majority of students evaluating the project positively across all measures.

TI  - Managing PBL Difficulties in an Industrial Engineering and Management Program
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-JIEM
AB  - Purpose: Project-Based Learning (PBL) is considered to be an active learning methodology which can be used to develop both technical and transversal competences in engineering programs. This methodology demands a great deal of work effort from the students and also from the teachers and it requires a meticulous plan and a well-managed project as well. These activities go far beyond the normal activities in traditional lectures, enabling to outpace the difficulties that spur along the way that may be both complex and demotivating. This methodology has been implemented in the Integrated Master Degree on Industrial Engineering and Management (IEM), at one public university in Portugal, since the 2004/2005 academic year. The aim of this paper is to identify and discuss the main difficulties of the implementation of PBL, mainly from the teachers' perspectives. Additionally, some effective strategies will be recommended to overcome such difficulties.
   Design/methodology/approach: The perceptions of the teachers were collected through a survey based on six main themes. The participants in the study include eight teachers from the five courses of the first semester of the first year of the IEM program involved in the 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 editions.
   Findings: Integration of courses in the project; student assessment; growing number of students in each team and the need of physical spaces for them; and compartmentalized knowledge has emerged as the main difficulties. To overcome these difficulties some key strategies were recommended.
   Originality/value: A new perspective based on course teachers' views and experiences will deepen the understanding of the problems and provide inputs for the development of strategies that may improve the effectiveness of PBL and introduce changes for its successful implementation. These strategies are intended to be transferable to other contexts, as most of the problems and constraints are common to other active learning approaches.

TI  - Evaluation of the CTMTC Methodology for Assessment of Teamwork Competence Development and Acquisition in Higher Education
T2  - LEARNING AND COLLABORATION TECHNOLOGIES, LCT 2016
CP  - 3rd International Conference on Learning and Collaboration Technologies (LCT) Held as Part of 18th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI International)
AB  - The majority of tasks and processes at the workplace involve the collaboration of two or more people, which explains that teamwork competence acquisition has become a priority for educational institutions. In project-based learning, student assessment is complex and generally focuses on the final outcome delivered by the group, without paying attention to the contribution of each individual or to the complete process. CTMTC is a methodology that facilitates teamwork competence acquisition and individual and group assessment in collaborative learning. This study describes and evaluates the application of CTMTC for student assessment in group project-based learning in Higher Education. The study also shows a particular case scenario of application of CTMTC and evaluates the benefits derived from the use of CTMTC. The results suggest that the methodology should be tailored to students' needs and course characteristics, and reveal a positive perception from students about the application of the CTMTC methodology.

Later, other schools with and without PBL curricula joined. At present, approximately 10,000 students sit a test every three months. The annual progress exam is not a single test. It consists of a series of 4 tests per annum which are summative in the end. The current situation with emphasis on the formative and summative aspects will be discussed. The reader will get insight into the way progress testing can be used as feedback for students and schools.

TI  - Multivariate Analysis of Students Perception on Teaching with Client Based and Non-Client Based Team Projects
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING PEDAGOGY
AB  - The classroom experience has evolved from traditional lecture, PowerPoint and whiteboards to a more active environment where students and instructors work together on hands-on activities to achieve the course objectives. Various names have been given to this pedagogy; experiential learning, project based learning (client based versus non-client based), active learning, and problem based learning are a handful of names used to describe this evolving pedagogy. The main challenge faced by educators in educating undergraduate students to be independent thinkers and problem solvers has been the driving force fueling the shift in pedagogy. This research looks into student's perception on project based learning with client based and non-client based projects in terms of: the project as a learning device, contribution to research knowledge, motivation to learn, contribution to skills and personal benefits, and their effects on student evaluation of teaching and motivation to learn. From the study, both project types motivate students, but, the non-client based had a higher statistically significant mean than the client based projects.

CP  - 2nd World Summit on the Knowledge Society (WSKS 2009)
AB  - This paper presents an integrated model to monitor and evaluate web 2.0 project-based learning through its application in a real higher education environment. Creating communities in the classroom has been the traditional method of engaging students. The web 2.0 technologies are changing the way learning communities interact. We designed a Social Computing Environment to support a community of students coming from Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan involved in an International Master's Program. This study suggests that Web 2.0 tools can be integrated in a model to assess learning effectiveness in terms of Learners' Satisfaction, Knowledge Creation and Learning Performance. Preliminary results suggest that the Social Computing Environment helped students to better collaborate with peers, tutors and company's supervisors, and also provided an environment where the learning assessment phase could be much easier to perform.

The proposal called "Strength X Health" consisted of 12 sessions for students in the third year of secondary school, which were aimed at improving their autonomy and health, using strength training as the main axis and concluding with the achievement of a final project where everything learned was compiled. The most outstanding results highlighted the positive evaluation by the students of the "Strength x Health" proposal, the involvement of the students in cooperative work for the development of a common project and the acquisition of proposals for strength training. Improvements in physical condition were observed, and the importance of promoting physical activity and the understanding of healthy habits from an early age was emphasized. In conclusion, this study offers an innovative proposal to promote health and wellbeing in secondary school students through physical education, supported by the fulfillment of sustainable development objectives.

TI  - The Academic System Influence on Instructional Change: A Conceptual Systems Dynamics Model of Faculty Motivation to Adopt Research-Based Instructional Strategies (RBIS)
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - Many universities have implemented initiatives to drive instructional change, yet their success has often been limited due to a lack of recognition of academia as a complex dynamic system. This paper explores how the interconnected and dynamic nature of academic systems influences faculty motivation to adopt instructional innovations, such as project-based learning (PBL) and small group collaborations (SGCs). We present a Conceptual Systems Dynamics Model (CSDM) that illustrates these interconnections, demonstrating how systemic factors create feedback loops that either reinforce or hinder faculty motivation, as well as other related factors. These loops, represented as Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs), were derived from literature reviews and qualitative data obtained from interviews and focus groups involving 17 faculty and administrators within an Engineering Department at a research university in South America. The paper identifies thirteen CLDs, comprising seven reinforcing dynamics that positively influence faculty motivation and six balancing dynamics that exert negative pressure. Using empirical evidence and analysis, we describe how the systemic factors influence faculty motivation, and how shifts in motivation reciprocally impact these interconnected factors. By elucidating the complex dynamics at play, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of how to promote sustainable instructional change within academic institutions.

TI  - Deployment of Capstone Projects in Software Engineering Education at Duy Tan University as Part of a University-wide Project-based Learning Effort
T2  - 2013 LEARNING AND TEACHING IN COMPUTING AND ENGINEERING (LATICE 2013)
CP  - 1st International Conference on Learning and Teaching in Computing and Engineering (LaTiCE)
AB  - One of the biggest challenges for schools and institutions offering IT-training programs in Vietnam is how to minimize the amount of retraining by IT companies and corporations for new IT graduates due to the gap between college education and real-world practices in IT. In particular, how can our IT graduates acquire the right knowledge, skills and attitudes to fit in our IT labor market?
   There are many solutions to the above problem like restructuring the curricula, integrating the materials of higher-division courses, or adding in practical skill-set training, etc. However, the most effective solution from our experiences is to change our current methodology of teaching and learning IT in Vietnam; specially, enhancing our students' capability through more use of real-world IT projects. This is usually known as the Project-Based Learning (PjBL) approach in which students explore real-world problems or challenges, and simultaneously developing interdisciplinary skills while working in small collaborative groups or teams. Since project-based learning is involved with active and engaged learning, it inspires students to acquire a deeper knowledge of the subjects they are studying. In this paper, we will present some current alarming issues of the IT training and education situation in Vietnam and how the Faculty of Information Technology of Duy Tan University tackles those issues through its deployment of major IT Capstone projects as part of a university-wide Project-based Learning effort.

TI  - The Effects of Project-Based Learning on Students' Academic Achievement, Attitude, and Retention of Knowledge: The Subject of "Electricity in Our Lives"
T2  - SCHOOL SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS
AB  - The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of project-based learning on students' academic achievement, attitude, and retention of knowledge in relation to the subject of "Electricity in Our Lives" in a fourth-grade science course. The study was conducted in a quasi-experimental design as a "pre-test, post-test with control group." In the experimental group, the unit was taught through the project-based learning method. The measuring tools were administered to both groups before and after the applications. To perfectly analyze the "process" of the method, seven different learning assessment "forms" were administered to the students. The findings of the forms indicated that the students learn to construct their own learning and to evaluate changes in their own behavior through the application of the method.
   The application of different methods between both groups had a statistically significant effect in terms of academic achievement, (F(1,112) = 46.78, p = .000) and of retention of knowledge (F(1,112) = 35.24, p = .000). However, there were no statistically significant effects from being in different groups for the attitudes of students (F(1,112) = .99, p = .321). For the students, being in the project-based learning groups resulted in better academic achievement and retention of knowledge than being in the traditional teaching group.

CP  - 4th International Conference on Software Engineering Advances
AB  - Increasing the practical skills of students is one of the goals of engineering education. This goal is so important that some industries build up special training institutions and supervise course topics and programs of these institutions to conform with their industry needs. After evaluating the requirements of the industry and by seeking the gaps between current and ideal condition of software engineering and IT (Information Technology) education, and also by considering educational standards, the new Mobile Solutions Laboratory has been proposed, as a solution to fill the gap. It also covers the ideal educational protocols for mobile commerce. This paper presents several topics including a project-based learning method, an evaluation method to study student's motivation for the course topics, and student assessment methods and criteria.

CP  - 7th International Workshop on Soft Computing Applications (SOFA)
AB  - If we accept that there might be a non-trivial relationship between team performance and performance of team members in non-trivial learning settings, then we need to consider seriously the question, what kind of relationship that may be. This paper will explore various possibilities by proposing and analysing candidate theories and models. Moreover, we will consider different ways to test empirically, which theory does a better job of describing and explaining teachers' judgements of team and student performance. To this end, we shall also discuss the important distinction between analytic and holistic assessment. This research will combine Poppers'/Miller's research paradigm of Falsifiability and Suppes'/Narens' research paradigm of Meaningfulness.

TI  - Testing the "Grandma Hypothesis": Characterizing Skin Microbiome Diversity as a Project-Based Learning Approach to Genomics
T2  - JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
AB  - The constantly evolving nature of genomics provides new challenges for students in Public Health as they try to understand how genomic information relates to health and disease. As Public Health curricula attempt to keep pace with the most recent advances in genomics, students should gain experience with analyzing genomic data and applying genomic tools to the study of health-related issues. To advance undergraduate and graduate student education and provide a more comprehensive view of genomics, we developed an educational project including both pedagogic and research components to characterize skin microbial communities (microbiomes) using targeted amplicon sequencing of their genomes (metataxonomy). All students completed the lab procedures, analyzed 16S rRNA genomic data (formative assessments), and wrote a five-page scientific report summarizing and discussing their results (summative assessment). Student grades for the summative assessment ranged from 31.5 to 40 (out of 40) points. They also successfully completed two practicums (problem sets) focused on microbiome sequence data and responded to 12 minute-papers related to genomic topics covered in class. In all these exercises the 2019 students outperformed 2018 students, who did not participate in this educational lab project. By fulfilling all the requirements of this project-based learning experience, students better understood the complexity of genomics and acquired a valuable set of marketable experience and skills in molecular technologies, bioinformatics and statistics (quantitative skills). Additionally, students were able to generate new valuable microbial 16S rRNA genomic data and test hypotheses about the composition and diversity of the microbes living on our skin (microbiota).

TI  - Does basic science knowledge correlate with clinical reasoning in assessments of first-year medical students?
T2  - INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY IN EDUCATION
CP  - 2nd World Conference on Educational Sciences (WCES-2010)
AB  - Previous research has investigated the outcomes of Problem-based Learning (PBL), but little research has compared competencies in PBL and associated clinical reasoning skills with other competencies in medical education. We used results from formative and summative exams during the first block of medical education to investigate how the performance of beginning, undergraduate medical students on online clinical cases and additional clinical-reasoning questions related to their basic-science knowledge. We found a moderate correlation between clinical-reasoning and basic-science performance. However, the level of correlation suggests that distinct knowledge and skills are involved in clinical reasoning beyond those associated with basic-science knowledge. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Hybridization of pedagogical models through acrosport. A proposal for a learning situation for Secondary Education students
T2  - RETOS-NUEVAS TENDENCIAS EN EDUCACION FISICA DEPORTE Y RECREACION
AB  - The lack of training for Physical Education teachers and the infrequent use of active methodologies are two reasons why some students in Secondary Education have negative attitudes toward artistic activities. The aim of this study was to describe a Learning Situation on acrosport with the assistance of a hybridization of pedagogical models, including Cooperative Learning, Formative and Shared Assessment, and Project-Based Learning, as well as to analyze its effect on learning. To do this, a total of 78 4th-year students, 41 girls (53%) and 37 boys (47%), aged between 15 and 17, participated. The three course groups (A, B and C) carried out different activities, divided into mixed teams over 10 sessions to cooperatively develop an acrosport exercise and formatively evaluate it. The results showed a significant correlation between the scores in the various instruments used to assess the two evaluation criteria, obtain-ing good results in both. It is concluded that the intervention through this hybrid model generates positive effects on the teaching -learning process.

CP  - International Conference on Interactive Mobile and Computer Aided Learning (IMCL)
AB  - the adoption of project based pedagogy in the traditional learning has always serves to enhance the knowledge of learners and develop their disciplinary and cross-curricular skills. In e-learning field, the use of this pedagogy presents even several challenges to the accomplishment of educational goals, in terms of design, planning, implementation and evaluation of learning. This work provides, at first, a preview of the obvious characteristics of project based e-Learning directed by competencies, throw highlighting its competency and assessment aspects, and then explain some constraints which can be encountered during the evaluation process of learner's skills. A strategy for systematic e-assessment of skills is proposed next, by illustrating different stages of assessment: pre-assessment, formative assessment and post-assessment. The technological core of this model is based on a trace based system which uses a repository of competencies and evaluation criteria in combination with information extracted from the virtual learning environment and provides the external observer, or the assessor, a feedback of relevant information.

TI  - An Embedded Systems Course for Engineering Students Using Open-Source Platforms in Wireless Scenarios
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
AB  - This paper presents a case study analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of using project-based learning (PBL) combined with collaborative learning (CL) and industry best practices, integrated with information communication technologies, open-source software, and open-source hardware tools, in a specialized microcontroller and embedded systems engineering Master's course. In addition to addressing industry requirements in both contents and methodology, the course develops capabilities and competencies in problem solving, independent learning, teamwork, and technical knowledge. Since PBL methodology alone does not ensure teamwork, it was complemented with CL. Design review meetings (as described in IEC 61160), deliverables, and organizational resources were also introduced to mirror industry demands. This structure integrated course content and student academic achievement in a simulated industrial environment. The course had students build a modular management system for home appliances, implementing control software on the "Arduino" open-source platform, as well as using wireless communications. The results show that teaching, learning, and student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL with CL. In addition, the introduction of industry practices, such us peer review meetings, brings academia closer to a real-world context.

TI  - The effect of using a project-based learning (PBL) approach to improve engineering students' understanding of statistics
T2  - TEACHING MATHEMATICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB  - Over the last number of years we have gradually been introducing a project based learning approach to the teaching of engineering mathematics in Dublin Institute of Technology. Several projects are now in existence for the teaching of both second-order differential equations and first order differential equations. We intend to incrementally extend this approach across more of the engineering mathematics curriculum. As part of this ongoing process, practical real world projects in statistics were incorporated into a second year ordinary degree mathematics module. This paper provides an overview of these projects and their implementation. As a means to measure the success of this initiative, we used the SALG instrument to gain feedback from the students. The SALG online tool - Student Assessment of their Learning Gains https://salgsite.net/; is a free course-evaluation tool that enables third-level educators to gather feedback specifically focused on what the students gained through the learning exercise they experience. It can be used to measure students' learning gains. Pre-developed surveys are available which can be modified and are stored in a repository for ease of access. Results are anonymous and there is the ability to download comments and basic statistical analysis of responses. Feedback from the survey points to a large increase in understanding of the material coupled with an increase in confidence. In addition we outline some of the limitations of our initial implementation of this approach and what we hope to improve on for the next academic year.

TI  - Transforming Tomorrow: A Practical Synthesis of STEAM and PBL for Empowering Students' Creative Thinking
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION
AB  - This study investigates the integration of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) and PBL (Project-based Learning) into pedagogical practice and investigates their impact on students' creative thinking. This research examines how a single case school integrates diverse educational objectives and technologies within a Tri-Phase STEAM PBL (TPSP) course. Using a quasi-experimental methodology, an 18-week TPSP course was implemented in an experimental group of 27 sixth-grade students. This group was contrasted with a control group of 56 students who received standard lecture-based education. To ensure consistency in education delivery, the experimental and control groups were taught by the same cohort of teachers. The PISA-based (Program for International Student Assessment) Creative Thinking Test was used as the research instrument to evaluate the differences in creative thinking between the experimental and comparison groups. Evidence indicated that students in the experimental group with STEAM PBL outperformed their peers in the comparison group in both overall social and scientific creative thinking. Specifically, the experimental group students' ability to generate diverse ideas (GD), generate creative ideas (GC), and evaluate and improve others' ideas (EI) were significantly improved. The experimental group students can think faster and divergently (GD) and develop unique and original ideas for problem-solving (GC). The student's ability to understand, evaluate, and improve others' ideas or products was also enhanced (EI). Evidence indicated that a well-structured TPSP can be used as a feasible and practical approach to improving students' creative thinking.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION, VOLS I AND II, PROCEEDINGS
CP  - International Conference on Computers in Education
AB  - Four mathematics project-based learning activities were carried out on a web environment in this study. Several mindtools such as dynamic geometry scratch pad, concept mapping and powerpoint were also adopted as learning aids. Forty second to fifth grade elementary school students from Tainan and Kaohsiung cities were included. They registered as the collaborative learners for one year. The quality of final reports, collaborating skills and the ability of using mindtools for each group were assessed while they were doing mathematics project learning through internet collaboration. Based upon the process-oriented assessment design, student's learning progresses were discussed in detail. Overall, the inter-rater reliability of the three assignment designs is between .84 and .92. These flexible structured and process oriented assessment designs would be of great potential to monitor the web collaborative learning.

TI  - Project-Based Learning and Evaluation in an Online Digital Design Course
T2  - ELECTRONICS
AB  - This paper reports an experience of an abrupt shift from traditional teaching to distance learning within a course on digital system design using programmable logic platforms. The course organization and evaluation model had to be modified on the fly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The adopted teaching and assessment methodology puts a strong focus on the laboratory component, assigning a very significant weight to project-based evaluation. As the access to laboratory equipment was cut, all the previously accumulated experience had to be modified and adapted to new circumstances. The paper discusses teaching methods employed within the course and analyzes in detail a project-based evaluation accentuated on modeling of a simplified processor. The advantages and drawbacks of the reported teaching methods are appointed. Possible design extensions are also suggested, which permit assigning the same core project to different students. We believe that the proposed project is a valuable instructional tool, in particular, for remote learning/assessment.

TI  - How Does Flipped Learning Work? A Case Study in Signals and Systems Teaching
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - Student-centered teaching approaches emphasize student responsibility and learning. Flipped learning is a student-centered approach to promoting student learning. In this paper, we describe a flipped learning strategy that involves fostering collaborative, problem-based, and project-based learning in engineering courses. In addition, we delineate the role of student assessment and teacher-student interactions in the flipped learning teaching strategy. In this study, we compare academic achievement and student perceptions of instruction in a lecture-based and a flipped classroom. The results show that the students in a flipped classroom had higher grades than those in a lecture-based classroom. In addition, students in the flipped classroom assessed the learning materials, activities, and evaluations more positively than the students in the lecture-based classroom did. Students in the flipped classroom were also found to be more likely than those in the other class to perceive that they could apply the knowledge and skills they developed in the course. They also had higher motivation to learn than the students in the lecture-based class and perceived that the instructor generated a positive climate that fostered student participation.

TI  - Design for "Innovation" and Design for "Performance" Two Case Studies on Project-Based-Design
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MECHANICAL ENGINEERING AND MECHANICS
CP  - 4th International Conference on Mechanical Engineering and Mechanics
AB  - Two case studies on "Design for Innovation (DFI)" and "Design for Performance (DFP)" are outlined in the project based learning (PBL) in the Engineering Design subject (48670) at University of technology Sydney (UTS). Projects are real-life and focus on "Innovation" or "Performance".
   Assessment tasks in the subject were aligned with the project goals. An important criteria in student-assessment was an innovative product to be produced in the "DFI" project. However, students in the "DFP" projects were assessed on the quality of their design processes and efficiency of their products. Authors have looked on the ways students have integrated their learning, planned, practiced, reflected, developed skills, and communicated online. Student-Online' logbook-reflections, team-discussions and peer reviews were studied over two semesters. We have holistically concluded that;
   In the "DFI" projects, students liked the freedom of the project, converged on a solution quickly, proceeded with dedication and passion, immersed themselves in their creative endeavour, and were more satisfied with the originality of products and the assessments. However, due to early-closure and convergence in the concept-design stage, students had difficult to quantify the quality of their products. Next generation of students in the project initiated a new product instead of addressing the shortcoming of the product.
   In the "DFP" project, students considered the design life-cycle, concurrently designed for-Xs, considered alternative concepts before proceeding with the final solution. An improved quality product was produced satisfactorily and the next-generation of students accepted their recommendations to further " improve the product rather than starting a new product from the scratch. However, students found the design process very immersive.
   The work is in progress and Authors recommend that students have experience with both types of design methodologies in their curricula and educators match these projects to the level of preparation of their students and the required key skills and graduate attributes to be developed.

TI  - Sabotaging Presentations to Generate Fundamental Questions and Integrate Theory and Practice
T2  - AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
AB  - Many teachers who assign scientific research projects to students require them to present their research to their classmates. Although it is important for science students to develop research presentation skills, it is questionable whether class presentations are an effective learning tool for audience members. In this article, we describe a dynamic and interactive presentation exercise that can be used for either formative or summative assessment, which challenges students to share their expertise with their peers via a unique motivating structure. Students practice their presentation skills while engaging authentically in a process of developing crosscutting, interdisciplinary fundamental scientific questions that integrate scientific theory and practice. This exercise may be useful in science courses in which students are expected to critically and creatively engage in and reflect upon scientific processes and content.

TI  - TRANSLATION PROJECT AS AN ASSESSMENT TOOL: UKRAINIAN CONTEXT
T2  - JOURNAL OF TEACHING ENGLISH FOR SPECIFIC AND ACADEMIC PURPOSES
AB  - The given paper focuses on the analysis of a translation project as a powerful assessment tool that can be easily integrated into prospective philologists' university training in order to enhance its quality and bring its outcomes into line with global industrial needs and requirements. With this aim, substantial translation pedagogy experience of project-based learning is consolidated from the viewpoint of action-oriented, student-centered, situated, experiential and reflective approaches. Translation project properties, design features, role and function distribution peculiarities typical for global professional environment are considered. The received findings are transferred and adjusted to the current terms and conditions of prospective philologists' training in Ukrainian higher educational setting. As a result, a working classification of translation project varieties to be developed and implemented into training process at different training stages is suggested. Their functions and potential usage as a flexible assessment framework is specified. The translation project opportunity for the arrangement of not only formative but summative assessment as well is substantiated due to its contrasting to the existing examination practices. Finally, the idea of cross-assessment as the complex assessment procedure conducted from different perspectives (hetero, self-and peer-assessment) with the help of versatile tools and instruments (incorporated into single flexible translation project) is introduced.

TI  - Impact of a PBL-Based Professional Learning Program in Denmark on the Development of the Beliefs and Practices of Chinese STEM University Teachers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
AB  - This study investigated 35 Chinese university teachers' development of learner-centered beliefs and practices through a six-month problem and project-based (PBL) professional learning program in Denmark using a mixed-method research. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the participants' teaching and learning portfolios, which each included six entries, identified a significant change in their beliefs, from teacher-centered domination at the program's start to more learner-centered beliefs by the end (Nine teachers held learner-centered beliefs, seventeen teachers held dual beliefs and nine teachers still held teacher-centered beliefs.). Survey analysis identified a significant change in participants' intended practices at the end of the program. Participants reported a significant increase in using classroom interactions and formative assessment and a significant decrease in using summative assessment, yet content delivery remained the focus of their practices. A significant correlation was identified between participants' beliefs and practices at the program's end, which was not found at the program's start. The results indicate a noteworthy impact of the PBL-based professional learning program on the participants' changes in beliefs and practices, and an association between beliefs and practices was found. However, systemic, individual and cultural factors may constrain changes in teaching practices.

TI  - Resignification of the Evaluation Process: The Experience of a School Learning Project and Professional Collaboration
T2  - REVISTA EDUCACION
AB  - The new pedagogical approaches lead teachers to develop collaborative practices that influence students' deep learning. In this context, this article aims to describe the process of resignification of students and educators on the assessment and learning culture following the project pedagogy approach. The design of this educational research is framed in a case study with a qualitative methodology. Moreover, the participants were intentionally selected, they consisted of nine classroom teachers and one hundred forty-four students in the fifth and sixth grades of primary education in a school from the commune of Temuco, La Araucani a region, Chile. Regarding the data collection, the researchers used techniques such as participant observation and discussion groups to deepen the analysis of their resignification experiences according to a grounded theory approach. The findings indicate that the development of the project methodology contributes to favoring the leading role of students during the pedagogical process by actively engaging in the evaluations of their learning. Therefore, the investigators conclude that integration methodologies are challenging, and this translates into an opportunity for the teacher's professional development while allowing them to position themselves as co-learners in the learning project. Finally, the researchers recommend applying project pedagogy to foster the resignification of the assessment and learning culture while protecting its formative, democratic, and located sense in schools.

TI  - Sustainable assessment of learning experiences based on projects
T2  - EDUCATION IN THE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY
AB  - In a project-based learning experience, the detailed monitoring of the activities in which team members participate can be useful to evaluate their work. Using learning-oriented assessment procedures, supervisors can assess the teamwork abilities with a formative purpose. Evaluation strategies such as self-assessment, peer assessment and co-assessment are often used to make evaluation formative and sustainable. Conducting an assessment strategy is not easy for team members, since they need before to have a reasonable understanding of the evaluation process and criteria. This paper describes a learning-oriented evaluation methodology and an open data framework that can be applied to collaborative project settings. An evaluation rubric and a series of indicators that provide evidences about the developed skills have been elaborated and applied in a small-scale project-based course. Projects were managed and developed with the help of an open source software forge that contains a ticketing tool for planning and tracking of tasks, a version control repository to save the software outcomes, and using a wiki to host text deliverables. The experience provides evidences in favor of using the assessment method and open data framework to make teamwork evaluation more sustainable.

TI  - A Project-Based Learning Approach for Building an Affordable Control Teaching Lab: The Centrifugal Ring Positioner
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - This paper presents a novel experimental setup for teaching control engineering. This setup was developed during a project-based learning activity. The approach consists in training a master student in mechatronics and control through the design, manufacturing, and control of a device that will contribute over time to the education of students by laboratory sessions based on the device. The latter is an easy-to-build, reproducible, and affordable experimental setup called the Centrifugal Ring Positioner (CRP). It aims at illustrating several concepts of closed-loop control (e.g. system identification, model validation, and controller design and validation) while getting acquainted with typical experimental issues like the handling of measurement noise and the real-time implementation of a control law. The CRP distinguishes itself from most pedagogical benchmarks by the wide use of 3D printing. It is an unstable and nonlinear system, consisting of a ring able to slide on a rod thanks to the balance between gravity and centrifugal force. The control of the system aims at stabilizing the ring at any fixed position on the rod. The complete methodology followed during the project-based learning approach to build and control a CRP is detailed, including derivation of a dynamic model based on classical mechanics theory, considerations on the mechanical design, selection of the components, step response and physics-based model identification, and PID controllers design based on computer-assisted methods such as root locus and Bode diagrams.

TI  - Assessment in problem-based learning: The role of the tutor
T2  - ANNALS ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE
AB  - Introduction: Problem-based learning (PBL) in medicine emphasises the tutor's role in facilitating collaborative and integrated learning. While it is widely recognised that tutors come to know their students, they traditionally play little part in the formal assessment process. We introduced tutor assessment into a problem-based medical curriculum and examined the patterns of tutor marks in four subjects, in terms of within semester consistency and their relation to outer forms of assessment in the course. Materials and Method: Seventy-four tutors assessed 187 students twice (formative assessment in raid-semester; summative assessment at the end of semester) in each semester, using an assessment tool that focussed on communication and learning skills. Tutor marks were examined using correlations, cluster analysis and chi-square coefficients. Results: There were consistent trends in the patterns of cluster membership for pairs of marks in high, average and low clusters from mid-semester formative to end-of-semester summative assessment. Cluster membership for pairs of marks was predominantly consistent. Most movement was frown lower to higher clusters over the two assessments, reflecting student improvement after tutors' feedback and tutor responsiveness to feedback to them. There was little variance in the marks of different tutors. Tutor marks correlated moderately and significantly with other forms of assessment in each subject. Conclusion: Tutor marks contribute useful, distinctive dimensions to assessment in a problem-based medical curriculum.

CP  - 33rd Irish Signals and Systems Conference (ISSC)
AB  - The coronavirus pandemic that spread throughout the world during 2020 and 2021 caused enormous upheavals in workplaces and educational settings. Most educational establishments were forced to rapidly switch to online methods of course delivery and student assessment, which presented a challenge to programmes with practical laboratories and project-based learning. This paper presents the approaches that were taken to mitigate the effects of Covid-19 on the practical laboratories for two analogue circuit design modules at University College Cork (UCC). The practical learning outcomes for these modules were facilitated by use of ADALM2000 Active Learning Modules combined with small modifications to make the best use of the kits.

TI  - Enhancing Cognitive Engagement of Preclinical Undergraduate Medical Students via Video Cases and Interactive Quizzes in Problem-based Learning
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Background
   Problem-based learning (PBL) is one of the main pedagogical approaches utilized in the undergraduate medical education (UGME) program at a private medical college in Karachi, Pakistan. Video-enhanced cases and formative assessments were introduced at the end of PBL sessions to evaluate their effectiveness in enhancing student engagement.
   Methods
   A mixed methods study was conducted with Year 2 medical students (n=102; divided into 11 groups) and faculty (n=11) facilitating the PBL process. Of the 10 PBL cases, five were converted to video-enhanced cases and five were kept as paper-based, "traditional" cases. "Micro" videos were used to introduce clinical scenarios, augmented by a set of guided questions related to the scenario. In addition, a formative quiz was conducted to assess concepts at the end of video-enhanced PBL sessions. At the end of a module, students and facilitators completed an online survey regarding this modified learning experience, and this was followed by a focus group discussion with the PBL facilitators.
   Results
   More than two-thirds (71%) of the students and all facilitators preferred video-enhanced over paper-based cases. Seventy-nine percent of the students agreed that this method increased peer-peer and peer-facilitator engagement, while 66% (n=68) of the students and 81% (n=9) of the faculty agreed that the end of PBL formative assessment activity would support the "Universal Design for Learning" framework.
   Conclusion
   Video-enhanced PBL used during the introduction of the case and formative assessment activities at the end of the PBL sessions improved student engagement and contributed positively to the discussions and their understanding.

TI  - Performance of speech-language pathology students in problem-based learning tutorials and in clinical practice
T2  - CLINICAL LINGUISTICS & PHONETICS
AB  - The purpose of the study was to identify if performance of speech-language pathology students in problem-based learning (PBL) tutorials could predict subsequent clinical performance evaluated through (a) a non-standardized, custom clinical evaluation form (HKU form) and (b) a standardized competency assessment for speech pathology developed in Australia (COMPASS (R)). Students' scores from PBL tutorial performance were correlated with scores in clinical placement on both the HKU form and the COMPASS. Significant correlations were found between students' PBL tutorial performance (reflective journals and participation in the tutorial process) and their clinical performance (treatment and interpersonal skills) on the HKU clinical evaluation form. Significant correlations were also found between (a) PBL tutorial performance (participation in the tutorial process) and their clinical performance (all generic and occupational competencies, and the overall score) on the COMPASS, (b) PBL tutorial performance (reading forms) and two occupational competencies on the COMPASS, (c) PBL tutorial performance (reflective journals) and four occupational competencies and the overall score on the COMPASS. The results highlighted the need for validating the assessment for the learning process in PBL tutorials with empirical evidence and the advantage of assessing clinical performance through COMPASS in Hong Kong. Tutors, clinical supervisors and students should be given clear behavioral descriptors for expected performance in PBL tutorials and clinical practice at different year levels.

TI  - LEADING ASSESSMENT PRACTICES TO FOSTER SUSTAINABILITY LEARNING IN ENGINEERING CLASSROOMS
T2  - TEACHING AND LEARNING STRATEGIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - There is a growing demand in industry for engineering graduates who can think "sustainably." However, there are many barriers to developing assessment that fosters sustainability learning in engineering classrooms. There is no consensus on the definition of sustainability and its key competencies and teaching resources are limited.
   Staff are unclear about what to teach, how to teach, and how to assess learning. Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning and should be planned from the earliest stages, but this is rarely done. Engineering relies heavily on traditional assessments such as tests and examinations, but these are known to encourage surface learning. Sustainability is complex, multidisciplinary, and needs context, which requires higher-order thinking characteristic of deep learning.
   Current assessment types for sustainability include examinations, case study, concept maps, and project-based learning. However, more research is needed to develop best practice assessments. Recommendations for teaching approach are to use a rigorous approach to instructional design, use a systems approach, and use a teaching model that promotes deep learning, incorporates context, and promotes alignment of learning objectives and assessment. Community-oriented assessments are recommended that feature the interdisciplinarity and complexity of sustainability and promote higher-order thinking.

AB  - This research aims to: 1) Identification of activity steps in project learning that can be recorded by video to facilitate formative assessment, and 2) Design a Self-Regulated Project Based Learning (SRPjBL) model to improve competences of Indonesian physics teacher candidates. The research method is done through two phases: 1) Study of literatures on video recording advantages in PjBL, and 2) Propose SRPjBL model to improve competences of physics teacher candidates through video recording based evaluation. The results show that the main phase of project learning is the inquiry activities to create new products. The activities are as follows: Problems challenging, preparing, planning, performing, and Evaluating. The process in each activity is integrated with self-regulation to improve competences of teacher candidates. Competencies are as follows: professional, pedagogic, personal, and social. Assessment of activities and products is easier by video documentation. In the future, this model can be used to explore competences of professional, pedagogy, and social of physics teacher candidates.

AB  - Background: Effective assessments programs are a challenge in problem-based learning (PBL). One of the main principles of this educational setting is the Formative Assessment (FA). We hypothesized that students' performance assessed by FA in tutorial sessions in a PBL curriculum is related to other summative assessments. Objective: To investigate the correlation among FA in tutorial sessions with grades obtained in Objective Structured Clinical Evaluation (OSCE) and Progress Testing (PT) to better understand the assessment process in PBL medical teaching approach and to predict student's future performance. Design: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted comparing FA, OSCE and PT scores from 4th to 8th semester medical students. Correlation analyses were performed using pooled and separate data from the 4th and 8th semesters. Results: From the 5th to 8th semester, OSCE scores were smaller compared to the FA, while PT scores were lower in all stages. In the pooled data, the correlation analysis showed a significant positive relationship between grades on FA and OSCE, FA and PT and OSCE and PT. A significant correlation among the three assessments strategies was also detected in the 8(th) semester, but not in the 4th semester. Conclusions: Assessment strategies in PBL approach, including FA, OSCE and PT, have positive correlations, which increases as the medical course becomes more complex.

TI  - Effect of students' learning styles on classroom performance in problem-based learning
T2  - MEDICAL TEACHER
AB  - Introduction: Since problem-based learning (PBL) sessions require a combination of active discussion, group interaction, and inductive and reflective thinking, students with different learning styles can be expected to perform differently in the PBL sessions.
   Methodology: Using "Learning Style Inventory Questionnaire," students were divided into separate active and reflective learner groups. Tutors were asked to observe and assess the students' behavioral performance during the PBL sessions for a period of 5 weeks. A questionnaire of 24 items was developed to assess students' behavioral performance in PBL sessions.
   Results: Active students tended to use multiple activities to obtain the needed information were more adjusted to the group norms and regulation and more skillful in using reasoning and problem-solving skills and in participation in discussion. On the other hand, reflective students used independent study more, listened actively and carefully to others and used previously acquired information in the discussion more frequently. Formative assessment quizzes did not indicate better performance of either group. There were no significant gender differences in PBL behavioral performance or quizzes' scores.
   Conclusion: Active and reflective learners differ in PBL class behavioral performance but not in the formative assessment. We recommend that students should be informed about their learning style and that they should learn strategies to compensate for any lacks in PBL sessions through self-study. Also, educational planners should ensure an adequate mix of students with different learning styles in the PBL groups to achieve PBL desired objectives.

TI  - A self-directed summative examination in problem-based learning in dentistry: a new approach
T2  - MEDICAL TEACHER
AB  - This paper describes and evaluates a new method of assessment in PBL, which was developed with two cohorts of dental students. The method involves students in PBL groups designing PBL problems and assessment tasks that are in line with the objectives of the course and the principles of PBL. Construction of tasks and feedback were provided. The student groups based the summative assessment on a selection of the PBL assessments provided. The evaluation indicates that senior students are capable of designing challenging PBL assessment tasks that are in line with course objectives and PBL principles. This experience raised the pass rates of the students compared those of with earlier cohorts of students. The students rated the method favourably; they considered it enabled them to demonstrate their competences and that it was more closely in line with PBL principles than other methods of assessment that they had experienced. The method is a promising innovation, which could be used in a variety of PBL courses.

TI  - Toward Knowledge-in-use with the Core Idea of Adaptation: Evaluating Unit Formative Assessment for Elementary Students' Scientific Practices and Knowledge
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION
AB  - To address the demand for designing and evaluating a knowledge-in-use assessment in the elementary, this study evaluates the validity, reliability, and fairness of a post-unit assessment (squirrels assessment) for core ideas related to Ecosystem Dynamics and Adaptation. This study provides evidence for designing and developing a valid 3D learning assessment to measure knowledge-in-use (e.g., recognizing environment changes, cause and effect, modeling/explaining adaptation, sense of community) with psychometric properties and fairness in the classroom. Participants are 682 children in 43 classrooms. Leveraging Item Response Theory, Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Differential Item Function, we examine the validity and fairness of measurement and the intended assessment construct of knowledge-in-use. Results suggest that the two-parameter Grade Response Model and CFA analyses support the psychometric properties and construct validity. Differential item functioning analysis (DIF) and testing invariance between student characteristics (gender, urban/non-urban, white/non-white, English language learners (ELL) status, reading level, age) are also evaluated. Results show that high-quality project-based Learning environmental design and assessment supported fairness across gender, age, and reading performance. In contrast, some items still favor White students over the Black, Hispanic, multiracial and students labeled ELL. Future research needs to consider potential bias toward race and ethnicity, local knowledge, and linguistic background, even in highly social science learning environments.

TI  - Student evaluation of a virtual experience for project management learning: An empirical study for learning improvement
T2  - COMPUTERS & EDUCATION
AB  - Project management education was designed traditionally according to an expository paradigm. However, it needs to be redefined to engage students in higher order thinking and to facilitate effective learning. This study proposes a student-centered approach that is aligned with situated learning theory in virtual teams and explores its impact on student satisfaction and learning outcomes. Using a quasi-experimental design, 122 undergraduate and master's degree students enrolled in project management courses at two universities in separate locations. They were separated randomly into two groups, an experimental group in which students used the proposed student-centered approach and a control group in which students followed a more traditional course design. Data analysis indicated a higher level of satisfaction and performance with the proposed methodology. These results suggest that the presented methodology, which was based on project-based learning in an authentic context that offers opportunities for students to experience virtual teamwork, was more effective than traditional teaching approaches. Furthermore, there were some positive and significant correlations between students' satisfaction and their final marks. In this matter, the most relevant aspects to facilitate students' academic performance were (1) positive expectations of future professional development, (2) clear learning objectives that consistently relate to the content of the course, (3) positive feelings induced by teachers' support in resolving doubts, and (4) academic self-perception. The findings of this study suggest that motivational and affective states influence student learning in higher education. This is consistent with current learning theories. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Project-based lab teaching for power electronics and drives
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
AB  - Project-based learning motivates students to learn actively, so it has been widely applied to many engineering subjects. However, the applications of this approach are limited in electric power courses because of the hazards associated with high voltage or mains voltage (240 V in Australia). This paper presents a project designed for a Power Electronics and Drives course. In this project, students use a programmable intelligent computer (PIC) microcontroller and an H-bridge to design a control system for a real practical application, such as a washing machine, tram, or electric lift. Students gain hands-on experience, and also improve their skill in product development, self-directed learning, teamwork, and project management. Practical projects increase the challenge for students and, hence, their interest level. The project includes both hardware and software. Each part of the project and the student assessment are described here.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, VOL 7
CP  - ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences / Computers and Information in Engineering Conference (IDETC/CIE)
AB  - Due to its focus in project-based learning, design educators must provide individual coaching and mentoring of student teams as they progress through their design efforts. In order to increase the quantity and quality of design mentoring, the authors have implemented the use of Wiki websites as a medium for providing formative assessment for student design teams enrolled in a sophomore-level Mechanical Engineering design course. Wiki websites, which allow for easy creation and editing of interlinked webpages, were created for each design team in order to provide a virtual space for the creation, compilation, and editing of their design project report submissions. With access to each team's Wild site, the mentor is able to observe each team's product design process unfold and provide feedback using an embedded commenting system. The public presentation of design reports also affords the facilitation of a peer-review of student work.
   In this paper the authors present details of the implementation of a Wild for preliminary assessment data for this tool. Results show that the students found the tool and the associated activities to be easy to use, helpful in developing better design reports and a contributing factor to their development of critical and analytical thinking skills. In addition, students who used the tool reported receiving more meaningful formative feedback from the instructor and reported giving more formative feedback to their peers when compared to other sections of the class that were not using the Wiki.

TI  - A Team-Approach to Putting Learner-Centered Principles to Practice in a Large Course on Human-Computer Interaction
T2  - 2016 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE)
CP  - IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)
AB  - We present a case study on how a team of instructors put learner-centered principles into practice in a large undergraduate course on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) that was run in 4 parallel groups of about 50 students. The course stands on the crossroads between software engineering, business, and research in so far as student-teams apply human-centered design techniques to develop mobile apps, test them with real end-users, read research papers and regularly reflect upon their experience. As a proof of the course-concept, selected results from formative and summative assessments are presented. The summative results show that students rated the course as one of the best of the 87 computer science courses run in the summer term of 2015 at the University of Vienna. The primary goal of this paper is to provide instructors intrigued by learner-centered approaches with ideas for their own practice. In particular, this paper is of interest to those who teach Human Computer Interaction and to those who seek inspiration on mapping their course to the 14 learner-centered principles.

TI  - INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES FOR SUPPORTING THE UNDERGRADUATE OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING TEACHING PROCESS: A SCOPING REVIEW
T2  - 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES (EDULEARN17)
CP  - 9th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN)
AB  - Computer Science degree students commonly have a high failure rate in object-oriented programming (OOP). To reduce the failure rate is needed that teachers use techniques to motivate and help students in keep their focus attention; to help students to organize their information for understanding and remembering, and to enable teachers to monitor and assess their learning. These techniques are called instructional strategies. In this paper, we present a scoping review of to answer the research question: What are the instructional strategies that have been most successful use for teaching object-oriented programming at the undergraduate level? The review was performed using three electronic databases: SCOPUS, ERIC and JSTOR. Searching period was from 01/01/2006 to 12/31/2016. Our results show some instructional strategies used in object-oriented programming in the last ten years. These are: blended learning, project based learning, object-first, iterative learning, instructional games, formative assessment, educational programming environments, bottom-up and top-down approaches, and interactive visualizations.

TI  - Beyond Letter Grades: A Case Study in Developing an Evaluation System to Generate Project Performance Transcripts
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING
AB  - Traditional academic transcripts are usually restricted to demonstrating students' achievements and experiences during college life. As an example of extended transcripts, this study aims to introduce the development process behind an end-user product for a project performance evaluation system (PPES), which supports conducting project performance evaluations and generates project performance transcripts at a university. The first part of the study described the design process of the PPES. A user group of instructors, which continuously provided feedback on the prototype design, was formed. Consequently, the PPES was successfully developed and several main interfaces of the PPES were presented. The second part of the study analyzed user satisfaction with the PPES and the project performance transcripts it produced. In general, students perceived the project performance transcripts positively, and instructors were satisfied with both the PPES and its transcripts. The implications of developing a project performance evaluation system were discussed.

TI  - Using Tablets for e-Assessment of Project-Based Learning
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 13TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON E-LEARNING (ECEL 2014)
CP  - 13th European Conference on e-Learning (ECEL)
AB  - Technology is confirmed to be an effective tool for computer-assisted assessment (Irons, 2008; Challis, 2005), producing feedback (Heinrich et al., 2009) and publishing feedback (Bloxham and Boyd, 2007; Denton, 2003; Denton et al., 2008). The arrival of affordable mobile devices has introduced a new means for enhancing the above practices (Fabian and MacLean, 2014; Plimmer and Mason, 2006; Salem, 2013). Student preferences to smart phones and tablet devices steer further the technological innovation towards ubiquitous mobile connectivity. Inspired by the benefits of such life and study style, educators have started exploring the use of these technologies. Tablet computers prove to become their preferred choice as they resolve some of the limitations associated with the design, readability and comprehensiveness of the feedback delivered through mobile devices with smaller screens (Strain-Seymour, 2013, Rootman-le Grange and Lutz, 2013). This paper reports how tablets and the Form Connext mobile app have been used for engaging a sample of 300 Business Studies students in in-class online assessment and designing and providing timely comprehensive feedback. The study has followed an action research strategy that is grounded on a continuous and dynamic process of reflection (Carr and Kemmis, 2003) on the effectiveness of assessment of student projects documented electronically through wikis and electronic portfolios. It refines the use of tablets for summative and formative assessment of the project-based learning tasks through three review cycles, each of which incorporated a Reflection and Improvements stage. The experience resulted in enhancement of assessment strategies and contribution to the development of contemporary models of learning through effective assessment and feedback (Carr and Kemmis, 2003). The results of the work confirm that tablet computers are an effective tool in assessing e-materials in larger classes for two primary reasons. Firstly, design of e-forms facilitates rigorous process of reflection and understanding assessment criteria that in turn benefit students when preparing for the assessment. Legible and detailed feedback could be produced anytime anywhere with synchronous updates within the marking team. Secondly, students benefit from immediate comprehensive feedback allowing them to reflect on and improve their understanding of subject matters, as well as to engage in discussing specific details of the work that are captured through the form. An unexpected outcome was the enhanced reputation and respect for the tutors amongst students, the triggering of student curiosity and enthusiasm in applying similar approach to their own work. The diffusion of the practice amongst other units and identifying other purposes for which the mobile app could be used are also seen as achievements exceeding the expectations of the project team.

TI  - Implementing a Design Thinking Project in a Biomedical Instrumentation Course
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
AB  - Contribution: This article illustrates how to design and implement a Design Thinking project in a biomedical instrumentation course as a bridge between education and industry. It also presents the effect of the project on student perceptions of their learning gains and their postgraduate preparedness. Background: Biomedical engineering continues to experience strong growth, with instrumentation being one of the top three segments of the industry. Design Thinking is a desirable skill in the industry, is highly applicable to the human-centered outcomes of biomedical instrumentation, and has documented a positive impact on student learning. Therefore, Design Thinking implementation in a biomedical instrumentation course would be valuable, but has yet to be accomplished. Intended Outcomes: The implementation of a Design Thinking project is expected to increase student learning and postgraduate preparedness. Application Design: A Design Thinking project was designed and implemented in an upper level biomedical instrumentation course. This article describes the structure of the project, for example, student outcomes and its assessment. The "Student Assessment of Learning Gains" instrument and a postgraduate survey were used to evaluate student perception of their learning and postgraduate preparedness. Findings: The critical elements of Design Thinking were successfully implemented into a four-week biomedical instrumentation project experience within the instrumentation course. Students perception of their learning was significantly increased by the Design Thinking project. A postgraduate survey indicated a positive influence of the project on student preparedness for industry and graduate studies.

TI  - Engineering Education for Sustainable Development: The European Project Semester Approach
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
AB  - Contribution: An analysis of the extent to which sustainability is present in the syllabi, project briefs, report templates, and student final reports of the three Iberian European project semester (EPS) providers, over a five-year period. Background: EPS is a one-semester capstone project framework that adopts project-based learning and multicultural, multidisciplinary teamwork. Educating engineers for sustainable development requires fostering critical and ethical thinking and a desire for equity, solidarity and preservation of natural resources, and cultural and genetic diversity. Existing engineering capstone design programs emphasize solving real world problems, hands-on training, and soft skills, but few focus on sustainability aspects of engineering design. The three Iberian EPS providers adopt project-based learning and teamwork methodologies, promoting the development of transversal skills and addressing sustainability in a multicultural and multidisciplinary background. Intended Outcomes: To show that the three Iberian EPS providers follow these recommendations and contribute to raising students' awareness of sustainable development. Application Design: The proposed sustainability learning assessment method collects evidence from syllabi, project briefs, report templates, and final reports to extract faculty and student perspectives. The sustainability-related terms collected were processed into word cloud format, allowing a simple and intuitive interpretation of students' understanding of sustainability, and in co-occurrence network format, to understand if sustainability has a pervasive or confined presence within the reports. Findings: Iberian EPS faculty and students are aware of the social, economic, and environmental impact of their projects, in terms of quality of life, social responsibility, the use of resources, and environmentally friendly technology.

TI  - The counselling self-efficacy scale for teachers: action research
T2  - EDUCATIONAL ACTION RESEARCH
AB  - The action research describes the process of how the Counselling Self-Efficacy Scale for Teachers (CS-EST) was developed and explores its suitability as a teaching and learning tool using a pilot study of 178 students at Tallinn University, Estonia. The study integrated action research, interdisciplinary project-based learning, scale development and adaptation principles. During six counselling courses the SC-EST has been used both from the third-person perspective of the action researcher to reflect on the learning outcomes of students and from the student's first-person perspective to support reflecting on one's own counselling skills. The study showed that counselling self-efficacy in prospective teachers significantly raised during the courses. The scale can be used as an online self-assessment task in conjunction with reflective journaling during university-level counselling courses, as the study showed that together they form a useful formative assessment tool. The SC-EST seems to be suitable for Estonian and international students, however larger international studies are needed to further validate the scale. I consider the action research as a transformative learning experience in my professional development.

TI  - Integration of industrial mentors into the teaching of a Naval Architecture design course
T2  - 2007 OCEANS, VOLS 1-5
CP  - 2007 OCEANS Conference
AB  - This paper details the Naval Architecture program at the University of British Columbia with emphasis on the delivery of the capstone design program in ship design. Since the enrollment is a small number of highly motivated students, the program instructors can utilize innovative project based learning strategies into the program. The paper highlights the iterative nature of ship design that is traditionally represented by a design spiral. In order to reinforce relevance and ensure that practices parallel those of industry, the instructors of the computer aided ship design course rely on the local Naval Architecture design firms to provide assistance to the students. This assistance is in the form of mentorship, access to proprietary design data, and student evaluation. In addition, the course instructors require that the student design teams complete a ship design that meets the requirements of an industry sponsored design competition. The paper illustrates the ship design process with an example of a student ship design project entered into an international competition.

CP  - 6th Latin American Biomedical Engineering Conference (CLAIB)
AB  - It is essential that the undergraduate in the field of bioengineering achieve a significant learning with a experimental foundation. Problem-based learning (PBL) is an alternative to reach this goal. In this paper, we describe our experience at the Faculty of Engineering at UNER working with a laboratory-based activity using PBL in the Advanced Control and Automatism course unit, whose aim was to digitally control the position of a tomograph stretcher as an open engineering problem. Also included is the evaluation of the activity using task specific rubrics.

TI  - Self- and peer assessment may not be an accurate measure of PBL tutorial process
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - Background: Universidade Cidade de Sao Paulo adopted a problem-based learning (PBL) strategy as the predominant method for teaching and learning medicine. Self-, peer- and tutor marks of the educational process are taken into account as part of the final grade, which also includes assessment of content. This study compared the different perspectives (and grades) of evaluators during tutorials with first year medical students, from 2004 to 2007 (n = 349), from seven semesters.
   Methods: The tutorial evaluation method was comprised of the students' self assessment (SA) (10%), tutor assessment (TA) (80%) and peer assessment (PA) (10%) to calculate a final educational process grade for each tutorial. We compared these three grades from each tutorial for seven semesters using ANOVA and a post hoc test.
   Results: A total of 349 students participated with 199 (57%) women and 150 (42%) men. The SA and PA scores were consistently greater than the TA scores. Moreover, the SA and PA groups did not show statistical difference in any semester evaluated, while both differed from tutor assessment in all semesters (Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn's test). The Spearman rank order showed significant (p < 0.0001) and positive correlation for the SA and PA groups (r = 0.806); this was not observed when we compared TA with PA (r = 0.456) or TA with SA (r = 0.376).
   Conclusion: Peer- and self-assessment marks might be reliable but not valid for PBL tutorial process, especially if these assessments are used for summative assessment, composing the final grade. This article suggests reconsideration of the use of summative assessment for self-evaluation in PBL tutorials.

TI  - Project Oriented Learning and self-assessment of professional competencies in initial teacher education
T2  - RETOS-NUEVAS TENDENCIAS EN EDUCACION FISICA DEPORTE Y RECREACION
AB  - In the current context of competences-based learning and assessment in Pre-service Teacher Education, this study assesses a Project of Oriented Learning which is used as an example of good practice to achieve professional competencies and analyze the level of usefulness of a self-assessment scale. One-hundred forty students from the subject "Psychomotor Education" at Autonomous University of Barcelona and their professor participated in the study. The tools used to gather quantitative and qualitative data were: a questionnaire, a self-perception scale of the students' competencies and two professors' teaching reports. The results show that all the students improved their level of self-perception of the professional competencies achieved during the project. In order of importance, these competences are: organization, assessment, teamwork, learning environment and dissemination. The conclusion of the study is that these types of projects, when implemented in real contexts with mixed teams composed of university professors and school teachers, are efficient not only to achieve professional competencies through reflection but also to be aware of the different changes that occur during the education process.

TI  - Towards an Evaluation Process around Active Learning based Methods
T2  - 2020 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE 2020)
CP  - IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)
AB  - This Research to Practice Full Paper pro- poses a novel incremental approach in teaching a Software Engineering related course, underpinned by active-learning methods. Teaching a Software Engineering related course for undergraduate students is a challenging task due to extremely frequent changes that appeared in programming paradigms and in software process development methodologies. In this ever-changing domain, which presents us with opportunities and challenges every single day, it might be difficult and almost impossible for teachers to predict what are those knowledge that will be of use to students, on the long term, maybe even for five years from now. This rapid growth in the software development evolution has led to a gap between how teachers do knowledge transfer to students and how students acquire these knowledge. To bridge this gap there is a need to change how we teach these subjects. Thus, the new theory of education suggests that learner should be in the center of the learning process and the instructors playing an advising and facilitating role. A shift in education theory to a more student-centered approach using active learning is recommended because this approach has its own role to make the students creative and competent in their study. In this respect, active learning's main drive is to put the responsibility of learning at the hands of the learners themselves and to delegate the role of facilitator to the teacher. In this paper we provide novel approaches in teaching an undergraduate Software Engineering related course at the Babes-Bolyai University. Its contribution is threefold: firstly, we introduce a new learning process design which selects active learning methods intertwining in teaching this course; secondly, we aim to study the impact of applying active learning methods on students' grades over the three academic years. Thirdly, we investigate students perceptions, their feedback and learning experiences on the use of applying active learning methods. Also, the paper reviews challenges and constraints that we faced while trying to teach this course. The analysis results show the effectiveness of our approach. Also, our students have expressed a high level of satisfaction, and in a survey, they indicated that the skills they learned in the course are highly applicable to their careers, facilitating their interviews for the engagement within IT companies.

TI  - How we capitalised on casual PBL facilitators' expertise and experience to add value to our medical programme
T2  - MEDICAL TEACHER
AB  - While problem-based learning (PBL) has been widely implemented in medical education, it has been acknowledged to be resource-intensive, particularly in terms of academics' time. In some institutions, such as Bond University (Australia), casual facilitators have been employed (paid hourly) to oversee the PBL tutorials. Apart from considerable experience as PBL facilitators, they also have expertise as allied health professionals or biomedical scientists. Several facilitators have educational qualifications. Recognising that their roles have expanded beyond the PBL tutorial room, we canvassed PBL facilitators in terms of their contributions to Bond University's medical programme. We can report that our facilitators have contributed to the renewal of Bond's medical programme, from design (e.g. curriculum structure, case-writing) to PBL case reviews. They are also involved in formative and summative assessment. Facilitators identified that, because of their prolonged involvement with the students in small groups, they consider themselves more than facilitators of student learning. They are role models and personal guides. Recognising the value these casually employed facilitators have added to our medical programme, we will continue to develop their skills in, for example, reviewing cases and assessment. We recommend that if institutions do employ casual facilitators, their expertise and experience can add value to the curriculum and to students' experience.

TI  - Adapting educational practices for Generation Z: integrating metacognitive strategies and artificial intelligence
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION
AB  - The educational landscape is evolving rapidly due to the technological transformations brought by the digital age, necessitating innovative approaches to engage Generation Z learners. This study explores the specific educational needs of Generation Z, defined as individuals born between 1997 and 2012, and examines the role of metacognitive strategies and artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing their learning experiences. A systematic literature review was conducted using academic databases such as Google Scholar, Scopus, and PsycINFO to identify 121 relevant studies published between 2000 and 2024. The review focused on research articles that addressed motivation, engagement, self-regulation, and cognitive processes in digital learning environments. The results reveal that active learning strategies such as project-based learning and formative assessment significantly enhance engagement and autonomy in Generation Z students. Furthermore, the integration of AI technologies provides personalized learning paths and real-time feedback, supporting self-regulated learning. However, over-reliance on AI poses risks to the development of critical thinking and self-regulatory skills. The study concludes by proposing a balanced approach to AI integration, suggesting that it should complement human guidance to foster holistic student development. Future research should explore the long-term effects of AI on cognitive development and the design of inclusive AI tools that cater to diverse learners.

T2  - INTED2017: 11TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE
CP  - 11th International Conference on Technology, Education and Development (INTED)
AB  - This paper aims to analyse the impact of the curricular unit "Entrepreneurship" on the development of student's transversal skills. The study takes place in a curricular unit that is transversal to all third year bachelor programs of the Portucalense University, located in the north of Portugal. "Entrepreneurship" is part of the study plan of programs such as Psychology, Social Education, Tourism, Economics, Law, Management, Informatics, Management and Information Systems and Hospitality Management. In this curricular unit, students are challenged to develop an entrepreneurial project based on a business idea that must be explored and improved throughout the semester. In this paper, results from an ongoing study based on the development of a questionnaire, designated "Evaluation of Psychopedagogical Practices of the Entrepreneurship Project - QAPPPE". The questionnaire was applied, at the end of the semester, to all students participating in the Entrepreneurship course unit, in the academic year of 2016/2017. Issues concerning student satisfaction with the project, developed skills, teamwork, teacher's role, student assessment and the overall evaluation of the project are explored in the paper.

TI  - Assessing medical students' perception and educational experience during COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the traditional delivery of medical education. Medical education programmes have had to cope with limitations on face-to-face learning, and accelerate the adoption of digital learning. In addition, the pandemic has potential serious implications on the psychological well-being of medical students. We aim to assess the changes in perceptions and experiences of medical students as a consequence of this pandemic. Methods Cross-sectional survey of medical students at Trinity College Dublin (TCD) between March and April 2022 was performed. The survey explored student satisfaction with the current education program, teaching delivery and the impact of COVID-19 on education and student well-being. Results 175 medical students participated in the survey. Overall, the majority of students were happy/neutral with their medical education. 93 (53.1%) felt tutorials and problem-based learning (PBL) to be the most effective method of teaching, followed by laboratory and clinical placements in 78 participants (44.6%) and hybrid-learning in 85 participants (48.6%). There was a mixed reaction to the changes in the delivery of education brought about by the pandemic. 67 participants (40.6%) felt happy with the changes, another 64 participants (38.8%) felt neutral, whilst only 34 participants (20.6%) were unhappy. However, most participants felt the pandemic negatively impacted their mental health, with 96 participants (55.8%) reporting negative responses. 58% of participants (n = 102/175) reported utilising the student support services at university campus and 49% (n = 50) were satisfied with their services. Conclusion Digital content and delivery confer the benefit of greater flexibility in learning, the ability to learn at one's own pace and in a preferred environment, however lacks the advantage of bedside teaching and hands-on training. Our findings reinforce the potential advantages of online learning.

TI  - Students' Perceptions of Best and Worst Aspects of Design Courses: A Qualitative Analysis of 87 Courses and 5591 Students
T2  - 2018 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE)
CP  - 48th IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)
AB  - This Full Paper presents the results of qualitative analysis of students' perceptions of the best and worst aspects of 87 courses related to design such as engineering design, product design, biomedical engineering innovation and design, and Mechanics-Based Design. The total enrollment in the courses was 5591 students at a Research-Intensive University in the US. Iterative close readings of the comments and open and axial coding were applied to the comments to generate codes that represent students' comments. Codes were grouped in categories that represent students' opinions about teaching. Students reported the best and worst aspects of design courses related to the following categories: course planning and logistics, teaching strategies, learning experiences, assessment and evaluation, mentoring and modeling, and encouragement and motivation. This work suggests that careful design of all aspects of teaching is important. Special attention should be given to aspects of design courses such as project-based learning, teamwork, and hands-on applied learning.

TI  - Teaching bioinformatics through the analysis of SARS-CoV-2: project-based training for computer science students
T2  - BIOINFORMATICS
AB  - Motivation We learn more effectively through experience and reflection than through passive reception of information. Bioinformatics offers an excellent opportunity for project-based learning. Molecular data are abundant and accessible in open repositories, and important concepts in biology can be rediscovered by reanalyzing the data.Results In the manuscript, we report on five hands-on assignments we designed for master's computer science students to train them in bioinformatics for genomics. These assignments are the cornerstones of our introductory bioinformatics course and are centered around the study of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). They assume no prior knowledge of molecular biology but do require programming skills. Through these assignments, students learn about genomes and genes, discover their composition and function, relate SARS-CoV-2 to other viruses, and learn about the body's response to infection. Student evaluation of the assignments confirms their usefulness and value, their appropriate mastery-level difficulty, and their interesting and motivating storyline.Availability and Implementation The course materials are freely available on GitHub at https://github.com/IB-ULFRI.

TI  - Assessment in problem-based learning medical schools: A literature review
T2  - TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Despite widespread use of problem-based learning (PBL) in medical schools, no review currently exists on ifs assessment. Given the importance of assessment for any curriculum, a critical review of the literature was conducted to explore whether the assessment methods match the philosophical tenets of PBL.
   Summary: Articles from MEDLINE and other databases on the assessment of PBL were reviewed. The following areas require special attention by PBL medical schools: enhancement of formal continuous formative assessment; use of the context of a working problem to assess knowledge and problem-solving skills; prevention of negative steering effects by a judicious choice of assessment content instruments, and timing; and implementation of a longitudinal and centralized student profile.
   Conclusion: Despite the existence of general practical recommendations on assessment in PBL settings, this review reveals a lack of uniformity and consensus on the practical application of general principles. Topics for future research are highlighted.

TI  - Problem-based learning in laboratory medicine resident education: a satisfaction survey
T2  - ANNALES DE BIOLOGIE CLINIQUE
AB  - Theoretical knowledge in biology and medicine plays a substantial role in laboratory medicine resident education. In this study, we assessed the contribution of problem-based learning (PBL) to improve the training of laboratory medicine residents during their internship in the department of virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, France. We compared the residents' satisfaction regarding an educational program based on PBL and a program based on lectures and presentations. PBL induced a high level of satisfaction (100%) among residents compared to lectures and presentations (53%). The main advantages of this technique were to create a situational interest regarding virological problems, to boost the residents' motivation and to help them identify the most relevant learning objectives in virology. However, it appears pertinent to educate the residents in appropriate bibliographic research techniques prior to PBL use and to monitor their learning by regular formative assessment sessions.

TI  - Student Assessment in PBL-Based Teaching Computing: Proposals and Results
T2  - 2021 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE 2021)
CP  - IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)
AB  - This Research Full Paper presents an overview of student assessment proposals for Problem-Based Learning (PBL) in Computing Education. Computing teaching has many challenges, as it requires different skills from students, often subjective and difficult to assess. In fact, technical knowledge alone is not enough to fully understand what is being taught, but the interpretive and logical skills to deal with practical problems and non-technical skills such as group work, creativity, critical vision, ability to cooperate and communicate. Active learning methodologies as Problem-Based Learning (PBL) have been used to dealing with such challenges, broadly developing technical and non-techniques skills in students. However, despite the benefits of PBL, the student assessment process is one of the points that present its own adversities and, therefore, an aspect that deserves greater attention. To better understand the nuances of this process and how it can contributes to the teaching and learning process based on PBL, this study aimed to investigate primary studies in the last two decades, seeking answers to the following research questions: RQ1) What assessment models are being used?; RQ2) Which aspects are evaluated?; RQ3) What criteria and media have been defined?; RQ4) Who gets involved in the assessment process?; RQ5) What is the ideal frequency to conduct the evaluations?; RQ6) What can these models reveal? As a research method, this study used the Systematic Literature Review method proposed by Kitchenham. As main conclusions, it was possible to identify that: generally, computing education based on PBL occurs at the undergraduate level, having as main educational objective the teaching of technical content; in practice, the need for a diverse teaching team is not reflected, the traditional studentteacher remains; to evaluate students, it is necessary to consider several aspects, technical and non-technical, defining specific criteria for each one of them; the main benefits for students are related to changes in behavior, development of soft skills and better absorption of technical knowledge; as main challenges for students, the difficulty to understand the nuances of the proposed problem and to be the main responsible for devising a solution for it without the figure of a teacher to give a clear definition of how to do it stands out.

TI  - A problem-based learning pathway for medical students: Improving the process through action research
T2  - ANNALS ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE
AB  - Introduction: Problem-based learning (PBL) is student-centred, self-directed and collaborative. In medical education it is based on clinical cases and is widely considered to facilitate the development of key professional competencies. Whilst PBL is extensively employed in medical schools worldwide, Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine is one of very few schools that offer it to pre-clinical students as a major pathway of study. We have identified several problems associated with implementation of the programme and attempted to provide solutions with 3 new learning tools. In this study we use action research to evaluate the success of our strategy. Methods: We examined the students' perception of the effectiveness of case-based formative assessment, case-based "question and answer" workshops, and reviews of annotated examinations as learning tools, using a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire. Results: A majority of both first- and second-year students perceived all 3 learning tools to be helpful. In general, the most positive responses were received from second-year students. First-year students evaluated case-based formative assessments more positively when they were about to take examinations. Conclusions: Case-based formative assessments, case-based workshops and reviews of annotated examinations were perceived as helpful learning tools by both first- and second-year medical students in PBL learning pathways.

TI  - Assessing the Effectiveness of Problem-Based Learning Across Two Concrete Construction Courses
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INSTRUCTION
AB  - The goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) pedagogy that was implemented in two different concrete construction courses. Both courses are a part of an industry focused four-year undergraduate concrete degree program. One of the classes focused on concrete problems, diagnosis, and repair of existing concrete, while the other class focused on handling and management methods of various concrete mixtures. In both courses, a PBL pedagogy was implemented such that students were self-learning and discovering the knowledge through an action-research case study. The action-research case study was specific to the course outcomes relevant to each course, but were assessed similarly. A total of eight different assessment methods were implemented across both courses' multiple times from 2012 - 2019. The results showed that the students are highly benefiting from the PBL pedagogy, which was indicated across all assessment methods. Each assessment technique provided a unique insight into student comprehension or benefits of the PBL pedagogy. The most beneficial assessment techniques were; pre- and post-student assessment, level of understanding and confidence, pre- and post-objective student assessment, and report assessment. These four assessment techniques provide both direct (objective) and indirect (subjective) assessment, while only requiring four total surveys.

TI  - Two Approaches to Assessing Interactions in Cooperative Work: From PISA Monitoring Studies to Activity-Based Analysis of Collaboration in Project Teams
T2  - PSIKHOLOGICHESKAYA NAUKA I OBRAZOVANIE-PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE AND EDUCATION
AB  - In the article the evaluation of interactions in the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is compared with the evaluation of cooperation on the basis of activity approach. The authors argue that in PISA, the problem and the interactions between those working on it are two separate subject matters of analysis, whereas in activity-based research on cooperation, cognitive and social components of problem solving in joint activity form one single reality for the participants of group work, with specific semantic, operational and subject attributes. Using the activity approach, the authors define the principles of monitoring and assessing abilities of the project team members in the process of team work. It is argued that the key integral construct that should be monitored in the process of team work is the design concept, its specification and the role it plays in the transformation of team activity. Assessing the development of abilities in the activity of project teams must as well be based on the typology of project teams.

TI  - GUPPIE Program - A Hands-on STEM Learning Experience for Middle School Students
T2  - 2017 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE)
CP  - IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)
AB  - This paper describes the details of a theme-based and hands-on STEM learning program utilizing an underwater robot called GUPPIE. Glider for Underwater Problem-solving and Promotion of Interest in Engineering (GUPPIE) is an example of a robot with oceanographic and environmental monitoring application. GUPPIE helps students to learn about fundamentals of physics (buoyancy, gravity, drag and lift force), electronics (circuitry and power distribution), programming, building (using tools and assembly), and testing in a systematic way. In this work we analyse the effects of the hands-on activities with meaningful context on students' 1) confidence level; 2) attitude towards robotics; 3) and level of interest towards STEM careers. The survey results suggest that using robots with sensible real world applications improves young students' attitudes and interests towards robotics. Based on these results, introducing young students to topics that are not part of official school curriculum, such as programming, increases the excitement and confidence in early ages, especially for girls, and can result in pursuing STEM related subjects in higher education. Results also revealed that girls are more interested in building while boys are more attracted to programming.

TI  - A strategy for teaching and learning in the PBL clerkship
T2  - MEDICAL TEACHER
AB  - There has been a move in many traditional medical schools to make the transition to a PBL curriculum. Much effort has centred on developing PBL strategies for use in the early years of the course. Few schools have successfully incorporate the principles into the later clerkship years. A model integrating structured teaching with the clerkship is presented to address the multiple learning needs in the clinical years of the PBL curriculum. Structured teaching is based on two complementary methods: SCORPIO sessions and the patient-based PBL tutorial. The former is a medium to teach clinical-psychomotor skills, while the latter is structured for students to learn clinical reasoning in the context of patient management. The preceptor plays a central role in the process, helping students integrate the structured learning experiences with clinical exposures in the hospital environment. We efficacy of the model is based on the theory that learning will be enhanced by Activation of prior Knowledge, teaching in Context and subsequent student Elaboration (acronym ACE).

TI  - Measuring medical students' professional competencies in a problem-based curriculum: a reliability study
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - Background: Identification and assessment of professional competencies for medical students is challenging. We have recently developed an instrument for assessing the essential professional competencies for medical students in Problem-Based Learning (PBL) programs by PBL tutors. This study aims to evaluate the reliability and validity of professional competency scores of medical students using this instrument in PBL tutorials.
   Methods: Each group of seven to eight students in PBL tutorials (Year 2, n=46) were assessed independently by two faculty members. Each tutor assessed students in his/her group every five weeks on four occasions. The instrument consists of ten items, which measure three main competency domains: interpersonal, cognitive and professional behavior. Each item is scored using a five-point Likert scale (1=poor, 5=exceptional). Reliability of professional competencies scores was calculated using G-theory with raters nested in occasions. Furthermore, criterion-related validity was measured by testing the correlations with students' scores in written examination.
   Results: The overall generalizability coefficient (G) of the professional competency scores was 0.80. Students' professional competencies scores (universe scores) accounted for 27% of the total variance across all score comparisons. The variance due to occasions accounted for 10%, while the student-occasion interaction was zero. The variance due to raters to occasions represented 8% of the total variance, and the remaining 55% of the variance was due to unexplained sources of error. The highest reliability measured was the interpersonal domain (G=0.84) and the lowest reliability was the professional behavior domain (G=0.76). Results from the decision (D) study suggested that an adequate dependability (G=0.71) can be achieved by using one rater for five occasions. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the written examination scores and cognitive competencies scores (r=0.46, P<0.01), but not with the other two competency domains (interpersonal and professionalism).
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that professional competency assessment scores of medical students in PBL tutorials have an acceptable reliability. Further studies for validating the instrument are required before using it for summative evaluation of students by PBL tutors.

TI  - Small-group work and assessment in a PBL curriculum: a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of student perceptions of the process of working in small groups and its assessment
T2  - MEDICAL TEACHER
AB  - The problem based learning (PBL) curriculum at Manchester emphasizes small-group work. This is supported through group assessment where students assess key aspects of their group's function. In the study described here the authors evaluated students' perceptions of both PBL group work and what a group assessment needs to assess. They aimed to produce a description of the cognitive and motivational influences on group process and unpack the ways they contribute to a successful PBL group so that the kinds of skills an effective assessment should assess could be identified. Focus groups and a questionnaire were used to generate the data. The focus group results indicate that students support PBL group work as a method of learning, and that those groups that work cooperatively are perceived as facilitating the most motivating learning environment. The students supported the assessment being summative and felt that it could be simplified to measure: behavioural skills contributing to maximizing motivation of the group process; and cognitive skills relating to the content of the group discussion. The questionnaire results also supported the use of a summative assessment of small-group work that evaluates the domains of group process and the content of the group discussion.

TI  - A Systems Approach to Managing Learning based on Bloom's Revised Taxonomy to Support Student Assessment in PBL
T2  - 2013 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE
CP  - 43rd Annual Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)
AB  - The dynamism and intensity of the adoption of practical learning problems (PBL) provide adverse effects contrary to traditional learning approaches. The difficulty in defining clear educational objectives aligned to appropriate forms of assessment is also a recurring challenge in the management of learning environments. As a response to this state of affairs, this paper presents an approach to a system for managing learning based on PBL that makes use of Bloom's revised taxonomy to support planning and assessment activities. The model was implemented using prototypes with low-fidelity screens and its applicability with regard to the conduct of teaching using PBL was found to be valid.

TI  - Monitoring the Student Progress in PBL: A Proposal Based on Authentic Assessment and Visual Board
T2  - 2019 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE 2019)
CP  - 49th IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)
AB  - This Research to Practice Full Paper presents a proposal for monitoring student progress in Problem-Based Learning (PBL). The adoption of the PBL approach has been growing in computer education, where problem-solving and group work are essential. Despite the compatibility and benefits of PBL, some challenges remain, in particular, with respect to the assessment process. For an effective assessment process, it needs to be well defined and managed by both teachers and students themselves, considering that, in PBL, the students are at the center of the teaching and learning process, they are active, and self-regulating. In this context, this paper proposes an interface for student progress monitoring (a "student board") based on an authentic assessment model called PBL-SEE. Constructed using the Design Science Research (DSR) method, this interface was initially prototyped and validated by PBL specialists. The results showed a good acceptance of the student hoard and important recommendations for improvements.

TI  - PBL-SEE: An Authentic Assessment Model for PBL-Based Software Engineering Education
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
AB  - The problem-based learning (PBL) approach has been successfully applied to teaching software engineering thanks to its principles of group work, learning by solving real problems, and learning environments that match the market realities. However, the lack of well-defined methodologies and processes for implementing the PBL approach represents a major challenge. The approach requires great flexibility and dynamism from all involved, whether in mapping content, in teacher performance, or laying out the process of how learners should go about solving problems. This paper suggests that management processes can help in implementing PBL throughout its life cycle (planning, implementation, monitoring, and enhancement), and proposes an assessment model called PBL-SEE for use in software engineering education (SEE). Two examples of its use are provided. The results show how the model can be applied and how the resulting information can be used to make the PBL initiatives "authentic," in that they bring the reality of the labor market to the learning environment, while keeping to PBL principles.

TI  - Medical education at the crossroads: Which way forward?
T2  - ANNALS OF SAUDI MEDICINE
AB  - Over the last 30 years, several changes have been introduced in medical education including the introduction of new contextualized approaches to instruction (e.g., problem-based learning [PBL]), the use of multimedia to enhance self-directed learning, the use of an integrated curriculum to address basic and clinical sciences, and the introduction of new formative and summative assessment tools that match with the curriculum changes. However, several challenges face medical education and need to be carefully researched. The list may be long and these challenges may vary depending on the needs of local and international health systems, the availability of resources, the vision of medical leaders and how they see these challenges and their impact. This paper discusses a number of challenges facing medical education including the selection of medical students and the validity of selection tools, students' learning skills, what makes a good medical curriculum, and the challenges facing a PBL curriculum.

TI  - An analysis of the implementation and continuity of WBL delivery evident in Capstone Projects in a private business college in the UK
T2  - HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING
AB  - Purpose An analysis is conducted on the implementation of Capstone Projects (CAPP) at a private business college in the UK as part of their work-based learning (WBL) strategy. CAPP are introduced for the first time in this college in the Autumn semester of 2017. The purpose of this paper is to study the continuity and impact of WBL through the CAPP. Design/methodology/approach Comparative data of student experience were collected and analysed from online polls throughout the Autumn and following Summer semester webinar lectures and a content analysis of formative assessment work included in the final submissions. Findings Data indicated that recommended changes after the Autumn semester were only partially successful by the Summer semester and that the continuity of the key pedagogical strategies identified in the Autumn semester were still noticed and mentioned (implicitly and explicitly) in the following Summer semester. Data indicated that the CAPP was a rewarding challenge, that the process of using a webinar was an appreciated and effective process overall and that good supervision made a significant impact on the success of the process.
   Originality/value The work adds to a minimal amount of research on WBL within CAPP in the UK and adds to the knowledge within the field of WBL.

TI  - Formative Assessment of Ophthalmology Problem-Based Learning Tutorials During Undergraduate Medical Training
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB  - Purpose: One of the major challenges lies in the use of strategies to assess students working in small groups. The assessment by tutors and peers, and self-assessment by students appear to be integral parts of problem-based-learning (PBL) tutorials. Our study aimed to analyze the formative assessment scores by students themselves, their tutor and peers during undergraduate ophthalmology tutorials.
   Design: A cross sectional study.
   Methods: One hundred undergraduate students' self-assessment made during ophthalmology PBL tutorials were compared with that made by their tutor and student peers. At the end of every session, each student and student peers were given an assessment form dealing with criteria like responsibility, information processing, communication, critical analysis and self-awareness. The questionnaires were filled using the 5-point Likert scale. The tutor's assessment was made using the same criteria.
   Results: There were significant positive correlations between self-assessment and tutor assessment in regard to participation in PBL session (P = 0.01), punctuality for each session (P <= 0.001) and bring new information (P = 0.001). There was a positive correlation between self-assessment and peer assessment regarding active participation (P = 0.02) and bringing new information (P = 0.003). However, there was no significant correlation between the overall scores given by selves and those by peers and the tutor.
   Conclusions: Students tended to overrate themselves. The self-assessment scores were generally higher than those given by their tutor and peers. To foster evidence-based practice of ophthalmology, the information acquisition skills need to be improved.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE EIGHTH ACM CONFERENCE ON LEARNING @ SCALE, L@S 2021
CP  - 8th Conference on Learning at Scale
AB  - One of the major criticisms of efforts towards offering education at scale has been the Trap of Routine Assessment, the risk that student assessment will suffer from becoming excessively simplified in service of automation and scale. In this research, we examine the ways that students in an at-scale graduate program in computer science were assessed during their degrees. The program in question has scaled to over 10,000 students in only a few years, but awards a traditional Master's degree, providing the opportunity to investigate whether scale was achieved by transitioning to more routine assessment or by bringing scale to traditional strategies. To do this, we investigate the syllabi of 52 classes offered through the program to identify the types of assessments used, and we survey teaching teams for their approaches to evaluating these assessments. We merge this data with historical enrollment data to gain an overall summary of the kinds of assessments and evaluations received during their degrees. We ultimately find the program's scale has been managed by scaling up traditional assessment and evaluation strategies as the majority of grades are generated by human teaching teams based on projects and homeworks, with a relatively smaller portion generated exclusively by automated evaluation of exams.

TI  - Comparing Competency Assessment in Electronics Engineering Education with and without Industry Training Partner by Challenge-Based Learning Oriented to Sustainable Development Goals
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study assessed the "creation of technological solutions for electronic devices " competencies evaluation when faculty-industry liaison is available. This experience at Tecnologico de Monterrey (TEC) was developed with challenge-based learning provided by the automotive electronics industry addressing subjects oriented toward some objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Electronics Engineering faculty and project engineers from automotive electronics and instrumentation companies promote design competencies in college students. This study analyzed the competency performance and outcome results of students who took applied electronics courses for the undergraduate level under the "i-Semester with industrial partner " for one semester and compared results with students that took the course under the traditional program. The competence evaluation was classified into three preliminary domain levels: 1 or low-level, 2 or medium-level, and 3 or high-level. Students were exposed to the conceptual, procedural, and attitudinal contents applied to solve the challenge assigned by the industrial partner. Students with an industrial partner showed a higher engagement, and they were more motivated in learning the subject, compared to students having classes in the traditional way. This study showed that in developing the competency "create technological solutions for electronic devices ", 55 students with an industrial partner obtained higher domain levels than 61 students with the traditional course.

AB  - E-learning data consists of large volume of educational data and available with complex and hybrid data architecture. Capturing of student performances, student evaluation and student's interaction information are one of the challenges faced by the e-learning software users at the time of analysis. Integrating student data along with educational data for analysis needs complex system design framework. New innovations in e-learning also facilitates augmented learning, adaptive learning, web based learning, activity based learning, and project based learning. Education technology interventions using learning management system, content management system, advanced distributed learning; sharable content object reference models and application program interfaces enhanced and extended the e-learning frameworks to a greater horizon. Present technology also ensures transformations of e-learning information without any geographical barriers. These educational and student or user data combined together forms big data architecture under e-learning environment and mining these big data for various requirements or knowledge discoveries needs innovative approaches. This paper identifies and evaluates various e-learning models and associated education technology paradigm. The research further explores and proposes a new framework for big data integrations. The paper also discusses the scope of future research on data mining and role of big data in e-learning environment.

TI  - The application of problem-based learning to the teaching of microbiology for pharmacy students
T2  - PHARMACY EDUCATION
AB  - Problem-based learning (PBL) is an educational format, where students work in groups on a 'real world' problem with a tutor facilitating. A PBL task was investigated as a means of teaching a unit of microbiology to pharmacy students, providing an alternative to the more traditional lectures and practical work. The task, and its assessment, involved preparation of an abstract and a paper for presentation on the methods used to detect and identify food-borne pathogens.
   The PBL project was favourably received by staff and students. Most students reported an increase in motivation to learn and interest in the subject, and the quality of the work was very high.
   Challenges to the implementation of PBL include time issues, group-related issues, variability among facilitators, student evaluation and faculty acceptance and training.
   Whilst more traditional teaching practices will continue to dominate, PBL certainly deserves a place in the teaching repertoire.

TI  - Assessing the instructional effectiveness of problem-based management education in Thailand: A longitudinal evaluation
T2  - MANAGEMENT LEARNING
AB  - Problem-based learning (PBL) has attracted increased interest in higher education due to claims that it provides a more active and productive learning environment.Yet, to date, most empirical research on the instructional effectiveness of PBL has been conducted in medical education. This article examines the instructional effectiveness of a problem-based curriculum at a business school in Thailand. The quasi-experimental study draws on seven years of student evaluation data to compare the instructional effectiveness of courses offered in a PBL track with other courses taught in the college. The results suggest that students perceived PBL as an effective approach to learning. PBL courses fostered a more active, engaging classroom environment that helped graduate management students understand how to apply theory to practice. The findings offer initial empirical support for the use of PBL in management education and counter the belief that Asian students are not responsive to learner centred approaches to education.

TI  - Effects of conventional and problem-based learning on clinical and general competencies and career development
T2  - MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - OBJECTIVE To test hypotheses regarding the longitudinal effects of problem-based learning (PBL) and conventional learning relating to students' appreciation of the curriculum, self-assessment of general competencies, summative assessment of clinical competence and indicators of career development.
   METHODS The study group included 2 complete cohorts of graduates who were admitted to the medical curriculum in 1992 (conventional curriculum, n = 175) and 1993 (PBL curriculum, n = 169) at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Groningen, the Netherlands. Data were obtained from student records, graduates' self-ratings and a literature search. Gender and secondary school grade point average (GPA) scores were included as moderator variables. Data were analysed by a stepwise multiple and logistic regression analysis.
   RESULTS Graduates of the PBL curriculum scored higher on self-rated competencies. Contrary to expectations, graduates of the PBL curriculum did not show more appreciation of their curriculum than graduates of the conventional curriculum and no differences were found on clinical competence. Graduates of the conventional curriculum needed less time to find a postgraduate training place. No differences were found for scientific activities such as reading scientific articles and publishing in peer- reviewed journals. Women performed better on clinical competence than did men. Grade point average did not affect any of the variables.
   CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that PBL affects self-rated competencies. These outcomes confirm earlier findings. However, clinical competence measures did not support this finding.

TI  - Establishing a Korean language programme in a European Higher Education context: Rationale, curriculum and assessment procedures
T2  - LANGUAGE LEARNING IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - A growth in interest in Korean contemporary culture in Europe has bene-fitted Korean language studies in Higher Education. This article describes an innovative Korean language programme in the School of Linguistic, Speech and Communication Sciences at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland. Since its establishment as a pilot project in 2010, the Korean programme has become a successful part of the university's institution-wide language provision. The authors present the university's approaches to teaching Korean as a Foreign Language within a project-based curriculum over the first three years of its journey from a pilot project to a more firmly embedded component of the university curriculum. Traditionally, the content and delivery of Korean as a Foreign Language programmes have not been adapted to learners' needs or the learning context, with a focus on memorizing word-lists, translation and reading dialogues in class. One result of such an approach is that student learners are unable to communicate appropriately and meaningfully within their own peer group. The article explores the selection and design of learning materials and the development of communicative, intercultural, orthographic and orthoepic competences in language learners, including Korean honorifics and speech levels. The programme's formative and summative assessment procedures use the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages as a means of specifying and designing the programme's projects, along with an end-of-module test composed of a dictation and C-tests. Finally, the authors reflect on four recommendations to improve and extend the provision of Korean language learning in Europe.

TI  - Hybrid Problem-Based Learning in Digital Image Processing: A Case Study
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
AB  - Contribution: This paper reports a curriculum development in hybrid problem-based learning (h-PBL), addresses the design, implementation, effectiveness, and assessment issues of h-PBL, and explains the mixed results observed regarding the impact of problem-based learning (PBL) on student grades from a hybrid perspective.
   Background: The effect of PBL on student learning is difficult to analyze. Empirical research on h-PBL has been scant in the engineering education field.
   Intended Outcomes: The hybrid approach described in this paper can be used to guide other course designs. Future research directions are also provided in order to better capture the positive effects of PBL on student learning.
   Application Design: A 3-D imaging project was developed and implemented using h-PBL. A non-parametric hypothesis test was conducted to compare four-year student performance data collected after the implementation of h-PBL with four-year student performance data collected under traditional lecturing; both sets of students were taught by the same instructor.
   Findings: Student project grades improved after h-PBL, whereas student cumulative course grades did not show significant improvement. The study suggests that higher ratios and weights of PBL, better timing in introducing PBL, and more integrated course components in the hybrid approach may further improve student performance.

TI  - Supporting Case-Based Reasoning in Pharmacy Through Case Sequencing
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORMATIVE DESIGN IN LEARNING
AB  - Pharmacists are often required to solve ill-structured problems aimed at achieving optimal health outcomes at the patient, population, and institutional levels. Given the complexity of pharmacists' clinical decisions, educators are exploring ways to foster complex problem-solving and higher order thinking in the classroom. One emerging strategy includes problem-based learning (PBL), which asks learners to collaboratively solve ill-structured cases that are representative of the types of problems faced by practitioners. Case-based reasoning argues that understanding and interpretation of a case is incremental and dynamic; that is, the lessons learned from one case might change in view of new experiences and across a case-based curriculum. While much of the literature is focused on how learners solve a single problem, it is unclear how learners construct their knowledge across multiple cases presented in PBL. To address this gap, this study focused on learners' perception of case sequencing and how that design influenced the development of their internal case library. Because we are focused on formative assessment, we used qualitative analysis to understand the nuances of our design and explored its implications for programmatic changes. The feedback from the participants focused on index generation, index prioritization, alignment with prior knowledge, and reflection. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

TI  - Case studies in computing education: Presentation, evaluation and assessment of four case study-based course design and delivery models
T2  - 2014 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE)
CP  - IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)
AB  - Case studies have been used in different fields of university-level education already for decades. More recently, the advantages of using case studies have been realised by university-level computing educators, too. New approaches have been introduced in computing education - such as project-based learning, problem-based learning, situated learning or inquiry-based learning. Many of those approaches successfully use case studies. Despite the increasing popularity of this teaching methodology there seems to be a deep lack in any research papers or practice reports which would attempt to describe, evaluate and assess possible approaches or models in using case studies in computing education. This conference contribution reports on selected best practices of course design and delivery implemented in one of the core courses of the Bachelor of Science (Information Systems Management) degree program (BSc (ISM)) offered by the School of Information Systems (SIS) at the Singapore Management University (SMU). The paper presents, evaluates, compares and assesses four different course design and delivery models which are largely based on case studies and are extensively using this teaching methodology throughout the entire course lifecycle (starting with the course design process, delivery of face-to-face teaching sessions, student assessment process and post-mortem course review process).

TI  - EVALUATION OF TUTORING IN AN EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECT OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING BASED ON PROJECT ORIENTED LEARNING
T2  - INTED2012: INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE
CP  - 6th International Conference of Technology, Education and Development (INTED)
AB  - Active methodologies are becoming now particularly relevant in the teaching-learning context marked by the Europe convergence process (Bologna). One of such active methodologies is project oriented learning. By the application of this methodology, students undertake a project in group to solve a certain problem which includes different stages like information searching, planning, alternative assessment and design or final resolution. Some advantages of this methodology are the possibility to acquire professional working skills, the development of self-learning, decision making and the improvement of motivation, since the projects are applied to specific situations very similar to professional practice. For all these reasons, project oriented learning has been applied in "Advanced Experimentation", an annual subject of fourth year in the degree of Chemical Engineering.
   In this subject, students complete a design of an industrial plant using the data obtained in the laboratory experiments conducted in parallel. Besides the study of industrial process, students should consider other multidisciplinary aspects in the design such as waste management and industrial safety.
   During the project development, tutoring sessions conducted by lecturers are essential to get satisfactory results. In these tutoring sessions, each lecturer guides students in the development of the project and monitories the evolution of working group throughout the course. Tutoring sessions are arranged in different parts for better coordination and for sharing the workload. Tutoring for each laboratory session is undertaken by the lecturer who has taught it; tutoring of the overall project structure is shared among all lecturers trying to have the same number of groups; finally, each lecturer is responsible of tutoring some relevant sections of the project (design, waste management and industrial safety).
   In order to improve and make more effective tutoring work, this academic year, lecturers have systematized the collection of data from the evolution and development of tutoring sessions. Lecturers have registered the number of tutorials per group, the approximate time spent in each tutorial, and the distribution of tutorials along the semester for each group. On the other hand, lecturers have designed an evaluation survey about tutoring sessions that students have completed at the end of the semester. In this paper, we analyse the results about tutoring sessions of the first semester of year 2011-12, in terms of tutoring development and student evaluation.

TI  - Medical Students' Views About Having Different Types of Problem-Based Learning Tutors
T2  - MEDICAL SCIENCE EDUCATOR
AB  - BackgroundAt Norwich Medical School, Year 3 or 4 medical students taking a year out of the 5-year undergraduate MBBS degree to do a master's degree in clinical education worked as near-peer problem-based learning (PBL) tutors for students in Year 2. Peer-assisted learning has been shown to benefit both peer tutors and tutees; in this study, experiences of students with near-peer PBL tutors were compared to students with other types of PBL tutor.MethodsUsing existing student evaluation data, we compared student views about PBL tutor performance, PBL group functioning, and overall satisfaction with PBL learning experience according to whether their PBL tutor/s were (1) a single near-peer tutor (later-year MB BS student), (2) a single staff tutor, (3) multiple staff tutors, or (4) multiple newly qualified doctor tutors.ResultsResults indicated that students' evaluation of tutor performance was more positive for near-peer PBL tutors compared to both groups of staff tutors for most areas evaluated. Additionally, students' evaluation of overall satisfaction with PBL was more positive for near-peer PBL tutors compared to multiple staff tutors. Tutor performance for multiple staff tutors was evaluated less positively compared to both single staff and multiple newly qualified doctor groups. But there were no statistically significant differences between the four groups regarding PBL group functioning.ConclusionNear-peer PBL tutors perform comparably or better to staff PBL tutors in salient measures of tutor performance and group functioning. We conclude that medical students find near-peer PBL tutors to be an acceptable addition to the PBL tutor workforce.

TI  - Tutors' performance evaluation: a feedback tool for the PBL learning process
T2  - MEDICAL TEACHER
AB  - In the implementation of problem-based learning (PBL) programmes, increased attention is being paid to the role of teachers as tutors. The put-pose of this article is to describe the different stages of the tutors' evaluation process within a single discipline using a PBL programme, and to present the results of their performance evaluation in two academic years. A checklist (with items corresponding to the tutor's tasks in PBL) was applied. This tool was considered both by students and by tutors as an excellent formative instrument and an essential framework for monitoring and assessing the pedagogical process. Moreover, the findings of this study confirm the existence of different tutoring styles valued by the students and also the importance of continuous feedback in the improvement of the teachers' pedagogical performances.

TI  - Perception and outcomes after implementation of problem-based learning in predoctoral pediatric dentistry clinical education
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION
AB  - Purpose Problem-based learning (PBL) has been a useful addition to health-based curricula by supporting learning with contributory discussion, research, and critical analysis of evidence in a peer-supported learning format. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of PBL on pediatric dentistry clinical education. Methods First-time pass-rates in clinical and objective structured clinical examinations were measured in student cohorts receiving pediatric curricular formats with (PBL+) or without a PBL (PBL-) experience. Student perceived learning outcomes were measured through a voluntary survey. The numbers of each competency attempt were compared between the study groups (PBL+ or PBL-) using Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests or Fisher's exact tests. Mantel-Hanzel ordinal chi-square tested for differences in rates of agreement on survey responses from students in the PBL+ or PBL- groups. Significance was set at 0.05. Results There was a significant improvement in the first-time pass-rates in five of seven competencies in the PBL+ group. A significantly higher proportion of students in the PBL+ group perceived that their predoctoral pediatric dentistry rotation improved their diagnostic skills compared to the students in the PBL- group (p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) between the perceptions on satisfaction of clinical or non-clinical staff support, perceived self-improvement in radiographic or clinical skills or overall benefits of the predoctoral pediatric dentistry rotation. Conclusion The addition of a PBL component to a traditional curricular format in a pediatric dentistry clinical rotation had a positive impact on learning in a predoctoral dental program.

TI  - Electronic portfolio development and narrative reflections in higher education: Part and parcel of the culture?
T2  - EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effective use of the electronic portfolios in the educational context of graduate students in a major research university in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The use of electronic portfolios with university students has many benefits including advancing learning, assessment and evaluation. The electronic portfolio is considered an innovative instructional approach that has not widely been used in the UAE. Forty electronic portfolios were included in the careful analysis of the e-portfolio development, rubric and reflective narratives. Description of best methods on how to develop the e-portfolio in university teaching and learning, along with areas of attainment is presented. A major result indicates a high reliability of the e-portfolio rubric (0.77) with UAE graduate students. Another result indicated that university student effective use of electronic portfolios leads to successful learning and reflective experiences. A key recommendation is that instructors and institutions can effectively utilize e-portfolios to improve learning and assessment, course delivery, and program outcomes. In addition, personalizing learning indicated by several authentic narrative reflections can be another implication of the e-portfolio use at the higher education level to improve self or online learning and project-based learning.

TI  - Problem-based Learning: Composing in the classroom as a music learning challenge
T2  - REVISTA ELECTRONICA DE LEEME
AB  - Problem-based Learning (PBL), one of the most widespread student-centered teaching models, prioritizes cooperative and challenge-based learning, with teachers acting as "facilitators", and formative assessment processes. In music, the search for ways to enhance the (co)construction of learning and complementary responses to expository methods resonates with composition centered proposals, with some incorporated into Music Education curricula as in the Portuguese case. What characterizes PBL, what data exists on its application and what links can we establish with musical learning to systematize its implementation and study through composition reflect the questions motivating this literature review. Thinking in sound, thinking in music, holistic learning, creative thinking, provide the constructs and references through which we discuss the foundations of this model. The summaries, in turn, produce the following conclusions: the study of PBL generates both benefits and constraints, and research on its theoretical principles continues to be far more abundant; composition in itself represents a problem-solving process, and musical learning through composition, when viewed according to the aforementioned constructs, can take shape in a way that aligns with PBL; it works as a guiding model for musical and educational planning, action and research, particularly through composition.

TI  - Cooperative projects linked to companies in Higher Education
T2  - REDU-REVISTA DE DOCENCIA UNIVERSITARIA
AB  - Developing cooperative projects linked to companies is considered an effective way to bring more realism to teaching in Higher Education. Getting direct contact with firms and conducting activities relate to them provide a complementary approach to the work done in classrooms, and make a profound mark on the students participating in them. This paper aims to prove that cooperative projects linked to companies makes a significant contribution to learning and satisfaction of students. To test this, we have analyzed, in the context of application, a course of the fourth year of a Business Management Degree, the student satisfaction with the different elements of the methodology (i.e. tutoring, assessment, skills acquired.) and the correlation between the marks of the projects and the exam ones. The results show that the methodology makes a significant and positive contribution in both areas, as most of its elements has been well rated by the students, and also that the grade obtained by them in the project is positively and significantly correlated with their final exam ratings. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the results obtained show that both faculty involvement in tutoring and assessment activities and clarification of the students expectations by using scoring rubrics for assessment, are critical elements in the success of the methodology.

TI  - Peer assessment of professional behaviours in problem-based learning groups
T2  - MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - ContextPeer assessment of professional behaviour within problem-based learning (PBL) groups can support learning and provide opportunities to identify and remediate problem behaviours.
   ObjectivesWe investigated whether a peer assessment of learning behaviours in PBL is sufficiently valid to support decision making about student professional behaviours.
   MethodsData were available for two cohorts of students, in which each student was rated by all of their PBL group peers using a modified version of a previously validated scale. Following the provision of feedback to the students, their behaviours were again peer-assessed. A generalisability study was undertaken to calculate the students' professional behaviour scores, sources of error that impacted the reliability of the assessment, changes in student rating behaviour, and changes in mean scores after the delivery of feedback.
   ResultsPeer assessment of professional learning behaviour was highly reliable for within-group comparisons (G = 0.81-0.87), but poor for across-group comparisons (G = 0.47-0.53). Feedback increased the range of ratings given by assessors and brought their mean ratings into closer alignment. More of the increased variance was attributable to assessee performance than to assessor stringency and hence there was a slight improvement in reliability, especially for comparisons across groups. Mean professional behaviour scores were unchanged.
   ConclusionsPeer assessment of professional learning behaviours may be unreliable for decision making outside a PBL group. Faculty members should not draw conclusions from peer assessment about a student's behaviour compared with that of their peers in the cohort, and such a tool may not be appropriate for summative assessment. Health professional educators interested in assessing student professional behaviours in PBL groups might focus on opportunities for the provision of formative peer feedback and its impact on learning.

TI  - Method for developing interdisciplinary examinations to test application of knowledge by students in a PBL curriculum
T2  - ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION
CP  - 7th Ottawa International Conference on Medical Education and Assessment
AB  - PBL curriculum developers have found that changing the method of instruction is not all that is required to effectively implement PBL. Student assessment must usually undergo change as well. The method described here, while not entirely new, has not been widely disseminated. This method requires construction of content examinations by a team of faculty, each representing different disciplinary or pedagogical interests, rather than one or several experts writing exam items in isolation of each other. Student-generated learning issues are used to identify themes across various tutor groups for required questions; optional questions can come from topics not universally studied. All are embedded in clinical vignettes which place the content in context. Various question formats and weights can be used, selected for utility in eliciting specific types of thinking, rather than for convenience or custom.

TI  - Peer assessment and self-evaluation with erubrics: a case study in the Degree in Early Childhood Education
T2  - REDU-REVISTA DE DOCENCIA UNIVERSITARIA
AB  - This paper analyzes the extent to which students are able to assess their own learning and that of their peers (peer assessment and self-evaluation) through erubrica, standards and evaluation criteria proposed by the faculty in the configuration, design and development of project evaluation. This type of evaluation and self-assessment presumes in the New European space of Higher Education that students take a more active role in the learning process and the evaluation itself will serve in helping to achieve the knowledge of professional skills. Thus the use of new technologies in self-regulatory assessment processes allows the student to achieve an optimal, effective and quality performance in the proposed content, as much as in the development of them before the group, considering the act of evaluation as a process of improvement and learning through tools such as the erubrica that favor the "overall assessment"; that is, the assumption of all core competencies. This study has been carried out in the academic year 2011-2012, for two semesters with different core subjects (theory and child education policy and towards an inclusive school: patterns and practices) and with identical groups (Group 1, 1st degree of infant A as the experimental group; and Group 2, 1st degree of infant B, as the control group). This paper exposes the results of peer evaluation and self-evaluation through the implementation of projects, where students evaluate their peers and evaluate themselves by comparing the results with the assessment made by the teacher with their groups and each student individually.

T2  - 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI2010)
CP  - 3rd International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)
AB  - Problem-based Learning (PBL) is a learning method aiming to improve students' problem solving skills, critical thinking and self directed learning. It shifted the teacher-oriented approach to student-oriented approach. Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) commenced PBL effort in 2006. One of the courses that involved with PBL pilot implementation is System Analysis and Design (SAD) course, which is a core course in Bachelor of Information Technology (BIT). A hybrid approach has been adopted in teaching and learning process which composed of 70% of PBL and 30% of traditional lecture. This paper will discuss the problems regarding the assessment process of PBL for SAD course in UUM. Based on the observation, the researchers suggested that customizable rubrics should be implemented. A study has been conducted to get the feedback and requirements, from both lecturers and students in order to improvise the assessment process. The finding can be used as guidelines for the better assessment process for PBL implementation especially for computer related courses.

TI  - PBL core skills faculty development workshop 3: Understanding PBL process assessment and feedback via scenario-based discussions, observation, and role-play
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION
AB  - Tutorial assessment in PBL is thought to be a valid assessment approach and is believed to exert a positive impact on the learning process. Reports, however, have demonstrated that assessment by the facilitator can be unreliable. Training of faculty to conduct this type of assessment has tended to be lacking and is a likely contributor to this inconsistency. This report describes the final in a series of foundation-building faculty development workshops focused on the instructional methodology of PBL. The PBL Assessment and Feedback workshop reported here introduced the theory and practice of conducting process-based assessment accompanied by formative feedback. Scenario-based discussions, mock group demonstration, role-modeling, and role-play were utilized as adult learning-appropriate strategies to familiarize participants with process-based assessment and feedback. Evaluation of the workshop by participants provided evidence that the majority of participants were satisfied with the methods and content of the workshop. Suggestions for additional training in these assessment methods included additional examples, practice, workshops, or observation and mentoring.

TI  - Skill and Performance Assessment Using Problem Based Learning in TVET
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 5TH UPI INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TECHNICAL AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING (ICTVET 2018)
CP  - 5th UPI International Conference on Technical and Vocational Education and Training (ICTVET)
AB  - The study of performance assessment using the problem based learning approach is not only done in the field of technical vocational education but also in the fields of health education, economic education, environmental education. Development of performance assessment studies in vocational schools with various research objectives is still rare in the technical field. Given the importance of assessment, especially by using the 2013 curriculum which is required to use 21st century learning strategies, one of which is Problem Based Learning (PBL). This article aims to explore whether performance assessment is suitable for use with PBL learning strategies especially in improving students' skills using systematic literature reviews. The results show that many countries have implemented performance assessment using the PBL approach. The fields that are the focus of the review in this article include improving the results of formative assessment, using the context of the problem to assess knowledge and skills and problem solving skills. Using a systematic literature review, this article aims to explore the extent of the current development of school mapping, to analyze the types of mapping tools used as school mapping tools, and to explore data and information presented in school mapping. The result, even though there are recommendations using the Problem Based Learning approach with performance assessment, the reviews in this article show a lack of practical application in general matters. This article provides an overview of opportunities for developing performance assessment using the PBL approach for vocational schools to improve students' skills.

T2  - PS-POLITICAL SCIENCE & POLITICS
AB  - The use and efficacy of problem-based learning (PBL) exercises during single class periods, especially in political science courses, have largely been unstudied. This article explores the ability of a PBL exercise to provide better learning outcomes than a standard lecture-discussion presentation on a particular topic in an introductory political science course. The author finds that the PBL approach, as a one-time pedagogical exercise, is not more effective at producing learning. In exploring the data, however, the author finds that differences in course structure and methods of learning assessment can have a larger impact on learning outcomes than specific teaching techniques.

TI  - Teachers' Perceptions of the Digital Transformation of the Classroom through the Use of Tablets: A Study in Spain
T2  - COMUNICAR
AB  - This study examines the transformation of classroom dynamics brought about by the use of tablets for educational purposes. The empirical bases of this study were defined by the "Samsung Smart School" project, which was developed by Samsung and Spain's Ministry of Education during academic year 2014-15, in which teachers and 5th and 6th year students attending 15 primary schools across several Autonomous Communities in Spain were provided with tablets. The research sample comprised 166 teachers. A qualitative analysis strategy was applied by means of: a) non-participant observation, b) focus groups, c) semi-structured interviews with teachers, and d) content analysis of teaching units. These techniques enabled us to extract and examine six dimensions of teaching (educational objective, teaching approach, organization of content and activities, teaching resources, space and time, and learning assessment). Our findings show that teachers tend to apply a transversal approach when using tablets to work on different competencies, focusing more on activities than on content through the use of apps. They reclaim the act of play as part of the learning process, and indicate tablet use encourages project-based learning. To sum up, this study shows that teachers view tablets not only as a technological challenge, but also as an opportunity to rethink their traditional teaching models.

TI  - Business and industry project-based capstone courses: selecting projects and assessing learning outcomes
T2  - INDUSTRY AND HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - This is the first of two articles in which the author shares experiences gained from the development and delivery of a business/industry project-based capstone course. The course integrates research, proposal development and design experience based on knowledge and skills acquired in earlier coursework. The course also incorporates standards and realistic constraints. Preparing students for 'real world' practices is an integral part of the curriculum for many engineering and technology programmes. Such preparation can involve numerous approaches to simulate realistic experiences, including engaging students with real-world external clients who might use their work. These practices offer the challenge of identifying and selecting suitable projects as well as developing the means to evaluate effectively the learning outcomes related to students' participation in such projects. This paper has two main parts. Part 1 concerns the process of project solicitation and communication with clients during different phases of the capstone project life. The difficulties encountered and the means of reducing their negative impacts are also addressed. Part 2 includes the development of the students' learning outcomes and the tools used to measure them. The second paper, also published in this issue of Industry and Higher Education, addresses some of the key factors in enhancing student learning in teams.

TI  - Escape rooms as formative knowledge assessment: A quasi-experimental study
T2  - NURSE EDUCATION TODAY
AB  - Background: Escape rooms offer an immersive approach to nursing education, serving as versatile tools for assessment and skill development. While research has explored their potential as alternatives to traditional assessments, their role as formative assessment and impact on knowledge retention in nursing education remain largely unexplored, prompting the need for further investigation. Aim: The study aims to explore the impact of escape rooms as formative assessment on first-year nursing students' knowledge retention. Design: We employed a quasi-experimental research design. Settings: Four escape rooms themed around medication, patient safety, low blood sugar, and sepsis were physically set up in a public university located in the southeast U.S. Student teams of two or three went through each room for an alternative formative assessment. Participants: 134 first-year nursing students, in clinical groups, were randomly assigned into an experimental condition and a control condition. Methods: A gameful experience questionnaire developed by Ho<spacing diaeresis>gberg et al. (2019) was adapted, comprising 47 items across six categories. Additionally, a test consisting of seventeen multiple-choice questions was administered online for pre-test, post-test, and retention test. Students' perceptions of their learning experiences were also gathered through an open-ended question, with themes identified from their responses. Results: The paired t-test on GamefulQuest scores revealed a significant difference between escape rooms and traditional assessment methods, with the experimental group showing notably higher levels of accomplishment, guidance, immersion, playfulness, and social experience. No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups on knowledge retention. Student feedback on escape room experiences highlighted entertainment, educational value, collaboration dynamics, and logistical considerations, underscoring the multifaceted nature of these immersive learning environments. Conclusions: Escape rooms promoted students' positive perception of learning experience, but showed no significant advantage over traditional assessment methods in terms of retention, aligning with existing literature on problem-based learning (PBL).

TI  - Problem-Based Learning and Case-Based Learning in Clinical Practical Teaching for Gynecology Residents: A Narrative Review
T2  - ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
AB  - Background: Gynecology residency training necessitates a robust educational framework to cultivate clinical competency, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Traditional lecture-based teaching methods are deficient in fostering active learning and clinical decision-making. Problem-based learning (PBL) and case-based learning (CBL) have emerged as learner-centered approaches that enhance medical education by integrating theoretical knowledge with clinical practice. This review aims to explain the efficacy, implementation frameworks, challenges, and comparative value of PBL and CBL in gynecology residency education, and explores the role of instructional technology integration. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted across PubMed, ERIC, Scopus, Embase, and EBSCO (January 2010- Inclusion criteria encompassed studies on PBL/CBL interventions in gynecology residency with qualitative/quantitative outcomes. Ten articles met the criteria after screening. Results: Both PBL and CBL significantly outperform in enhancing clinical decision-making, differential diagnosis, knowledge retention, procedural planning, and long-term knowledge application. PBL utilizes open-ended problems to cultivate self-directed learning, critical thinking, and collaborative problem-solving (eg, managing complex AUB etiologies). CBL employs structured clinical cases to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, improving diagnostic reasoning and patient management skills. Key implementation frameworks involve careful pre-session preparation, facilitator-guided discussions on authentic cases, and structured feedback. Challenges include significant faculty time for case design/facilitation, resource intensity, and competency assessment. PBL fosters deep theoretical understanding, while CBL excels in clinical skill translation. Integrating both approaches creates a balanced curriculum. Augmenting PBL/CBL with simulation, flipped classrooms, mobile learning, and AI enhances accessibility, personalization, and procedural skill practice. Conclusion: PBL and CBL are transformative pedagogical strategies for gynecology residency training, effectively developing competencies needed for complex clinical practice. Successful implementation requires rigorously designed cases, faculty trained in facilitative guidance, and strategic technology integration. These approaches prepare residents not only as skilled technicians but as adaptable, patient-centered practitioners capable of navigating evolving healthcare challenges. Investment in faculty development and technology-enhanced PBL/CBL models is crucial for advancing gynecologic education globally.

TI  - Didactic Strategies to Promote Competencies in Sustainability
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Higher education is a principal agent for addressing the sustainable development goals proposed by the 2030 Agenda, because of its key mission of knowledge generation, teaching and social innovation for sustainability. In order to achieve this, higher education needs to integrate transversally the values of sustainability in the way of developing the field of management, as well as research, university life and, of course, teaching. This paper focuses on teaching, and more specifically on the didactic strategies considered most relevant for training in sustainability competencies in college students, according to the guidelines commonly accepted by the international academic community. Through collaborative work among experts from six Spanish universities taking part in the EDINSOST project (education and social innovation for sustainability), funded by the Spanish R&D+i Program, in this paper the role of five active learning strategies (service learning, problem-based learning, project-oriented learning, simulation games and case studies) in education for sustainability are reviewed, and a systematic approach of their implementation in higher education settings is presented. The results provide a synthesis of their objectives, foundations, and stages of application (planning, implementation, and learning assessment), which can be used as valuable guidelines for teachers.

TI  - A simple instrument for the assessment of student performance in problem-based learning tutorials
T2  - ANNALS ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE
AB  - Introduction: A process-oriented instrument was developed for the summative assessment of student performance during problem-based learning (PBL) tutorials. This study evaluated (1) the acceptability of the instrument by tutors and (2) the consistency of assessment scores by different raters. Materials and methods: A survey of the tutors who had used the instrument was conducted to determine whether the assessment instrument or form was user-friendly. The 4 competencies assessed, using a 5-point rating scale, were (1) participation and communication skills, (2) cooperation or team-building skills, (3) comprehension or reasoning skills and (4) knowledge or information-gathering skills. Tutors were given a set of criteria guidelines for scoring the students' performance in these 4 competencies. Tutors were not attached to a particular PBL group, but took turns to facilitate different groups on different case or problem discussions. Assessment scores for one cohort of undergraduate medical students in their respective PBL groups in Year I (2003/2004) and Year II (2004/2005) were analysed. The consistency of scores was analysed using intraclass correlation. Results: The majority of the tutors surveyed expressed no difficulty in using the instrument and agreed that it helped them assess the students fairly. Analysis of the scores obtained for the above cohort indicated that the different raters were relatively consistent in their assessment of student performance, despite a small number consistently showing either "strict" or "indiscriminate" rating practice. Conclusion: The instrument designed for the assessment of student performance in the PBL tutorial classroom setting is user-friendly and is reliable when used judiciously with the criteria guidelines provided.

TI  - STRATEGICAL COMBINATION OF PROBLEM BASED LEARNING (BPL) AND FORMATIVE EVALUATION FOR EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS IMPARTED WITHIN SCIENCE DEGREE PROGRAMS
T2  - EDULEARN16: 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES
CP  - 8th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN)
AB  - PBL has supposed an unquestionable change in low and high educational practices. Since it became popular in the 1960s it has been satisfactorily introduced into many fields of knowledge. Science is one of the areas with more applications of PBLs. Nonetheless, how to evaluate PBL practices is not an easy task. Should we evaluate all the tasks? Should we give a feedback to all the jobs? Has been the strategy followed adequate and useful? Are typical doubts within teachers.
   Usual evaluation systems are typically quantitative, using numbers to assess learner achievement and are normally focused on how well a learning task is going on. This is the case of the summative evaluation system, between others. Formative assessments, on the contrary, give the possibility to ensure that the objectives of the learning process are being achieved. In most of the cases, moreover, it provides useful information to identify the problematic aspects of the strategy carried out.
   Although it has been preferably applied in lower educational levels we propose a formative assessment to carry out together with a Problem Based Learning strategy within an experimental subject of the degree in chemistry. The principal objective of this methodology is to introduce students to the Analytical Chemistry; therefore, it will be applied in the basic block of the degree, that is, in the first year.
   For the development of the methodology we proposed a strategy which combines seminaries and experimental work in the laboratory. In the first session the teacher will introduce the problem in hands, which will be the common threat for the next sessions. The problem proposed is based on the parameters usually used to define the quality of drinking water. In this way some concepts belonging to the field of analytical chemistry will be addressed, such as acid-base titrations, spectophotometric techniques, etc.
   The tasks proposed (bibliographic searches, the elaboration of a first report which includes the experimental work to do in the lab, between others) will be carried out individually and/or in groups. The evaluation process will also be mixed, including evaluations from the teacher, evaluations from the other students, and also self-assessment. Students, therefore, would be evaluated and evaluators, so the evaluation would suppose less time consuming, and will involve all the students. Meanwhile, the PBL strategy carried out will also be analysed.
   In order to verify the applicability of the combination of PBL and FA the methodology proposed here would be simultaneously applied in two different faculties of the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU; in the faculty of Science and Technology in Bilbao, and in the faculty of Chemistry in Donostia-San Sebastian.

TI  - Supporting traditional PBL with online discussion forums: A study from Qassim Medical School
T2  - MEDICAL TEACHER
AB  - Background: The Qassim Medical School first year curriculum includes a 5-week problem-based learning (PBL) block. Student evaluation has highlighted inadequate feedback and lack of student-student and student-tutor interactions. An online intervention may alleviate this.
   Methodology: For each problem, a discussion forum (DF) was created with 14 threads (one for each group) in virtual PBL rooms. Students' and tutors' perceived satisfaction of the intervention was evaluated and types of posts were classified.
   Results: By the end of the block, all academic staff involved and 123 students (95%) had participated in the DFs. There were around 2800 posts and 28,500 views. All 14 tutors and 102 (78%) students completed the online questionnaire. Of the students, 66 (76%) male and 36 (92%) female students responded. Overall, both students and tutors perceived the intervention positively. Posts included: reforming and finalizing learning objectives, posting the concept map constructed in the face-to-face session and questioning, encouraging and motivating each other. In addition, posts included tutors' feedback and redirection.
   Conclusions: Blending e-learning with conventional PBL may help overcome student-perceived shortcomings of conventional PBL and improve the learning experience, making learning more interactive and interesting.

TI  - Using Problems to Learn in a Polytechnic Context
T2  - AUTHENTIC PROBLEM SOLVING AND LEARNING IN THE 21ST CENTURY: PERSPECTIVES FROM SINGAPORE AND BEYOND
AB  - This chapter examines the relationship between problems and learning in a problem-based learning (PBL) environment using the context of a case study of a polytechnic in Singapore. The authors detail how curriculum is problematised (into different types of problems) around a set of desired educational outcomes and explicate how problems are used for the purpose of triggering interest and engagement, as well as promoting deep understanding, guiding classroom facilitation and informing student assessment in the learning process. Empirical evidence of the effectiveness of problems in learning in three disciplines is shared, with suggestions of how the use of problems in learning can be supported by academic policies and professional development for academic staff. An overarching theme of the chapter focuses on how PBL is a method for learning that facilitates deep learning and develops life skills such as collaboration, sense-making and problem-solving capabilities for the work place.

TI  - Possibilities and limitations of formative assessment in Projects Oriented Learning
T2  - CULTURA CIENCIA Y DEPORTE
AB  - Formative and Share Assessment (F&SA) and significant learning are deficient in physical education (PE) subjects in Early Childhood Education Degree, so it is necessary to analyse the perception of students about possibilities and limitations of F&SA carried out in an education proposal, based on a Project Oriented Learning (POL). The methodological approach is quantitative and the scope is descriptive, using a Likert scale questionnaire. The sample is 651 students, from 2014 to 2020. The results report that the students consider this F&SA very favourable to improve the acquisition of professional skills and the development of functional and meaningful learning; but it is necessary to strengthen the negotiation of this assessment at the beginning of the subject and a stable and experienced teaching staff is required to carry out this type of project. In conclusion, it is necessary to give students a voice about these possibilities and limitations to improve their own teaching practice in the area of PE in the Early Childhood Education Degree, favouring the feeling qualified to teach this discipline in the near professional future.

TI  - Applicability and performance of convolutional neural networks for the identification of periodontal bone loss in periapical radiographs: a scoping review
T2  - ORAL RADIOLOGY
AB  - The study aimed to review the applicability and performance of various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for the identification of periodontal bone loss (PBL) in digital periapical radiographs achieved through classification, detection, and segmentation approaches. We searched the PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and SCOPUS databases for articles published up to June 2024. After the selection process, a total of 11 studies were included in this review. The reviewed studies demonstrated that CNNs have a significant potential application for automatic identification of PBL on periapical radiographs through classification and segmentation approaches. CNN architectures can be utilized to classify the presence or absence of PBL, the severity or degree of PBL, and PBL area segmentation. CNN showed a promising performance for PBL identification on periapical radiographs. Future research should focus on dataset preparation, proper selection of CNN architecture, and robust performance evaluation to improve the model. Utilizing an optimized CNN architecture is expected to assist dentists by providing accurate and efficient identification of PBL.

TI  - From Struggle to Mastery: AI-Powered Writing Skills in ESL Education
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Featured Application This study offers a practical model for integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools into writing instructions for English as a Second Language (ESL) learners in secondary education. By blending the Writing Workshop Instructional Model (WWIM) with AI-powered platforms such as Grammarly and ChatGPT, the research presents a scalable, classroom-tested approach to enhancing students' academic writing skills. The findings can be directly applied in bilingual and multilingual educational contexts where students struggle with coherence, organization, and writing confidence. Specifically, schools implementing project-based learning and following international curricula (e.g., Cambridge Assessment) can adopt this hybrid model to foster independent, ethical, and critical writing practices among learners. The approach is especially valuable for educators seeking to integrate AI in formative assessment, real-time feedback, and iterative revision cycles within structured pedagogy.Abstract Despite reaching intermediate English proficiency, many bilingual secondary students in Colombia struggle with academic writing due to difficulties in organizing ideas and expressing arguments coherently. To address this issue, this study explores the integration of AI-powered tools-Grammarly and ChatGPT-within the Writing Workshop Instructional Model (WWIM) to enhance students' writing skills. Conducted at a bilingual secondary school, the intervention targeted 10th grade ESL learners and focused on improving grammar accuracy, textual coherence, and organizational structure. Drawing on Galbraith's model of writing as content generation, the study adopted a design-based research methodology, incorporating iterations of implementation, feedback, and refinement. The results indicate that combining WWIM with AI feedback significantly improved students' academic writing performance. Learners reported greater confidence and engagement when revising drafts using automated suggestions. These findings highlight the pedagogical potential of integrating AI tools into writing instructions and offer practical implications for enhancing academic writing curricula in secondary ESL contexts.

AB  - Enhancement of industry competitiveness can drive by innovation, which key man of process innovation development is the skilled workforce who is usually machine operator in manufacture. Work integrated learning (WiL) is the way for skill workforce development based on experience -based learning by providing student experience in a daily job and relating theory about what they did to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Development of diploma electronics students working at electronics manufacturing company under the WiL program through an extra curriculum based on project based learning and integrated work experience with a facilitator organized and support integrated learning activities. The learning outcomes comprise basic electronic skill profession, critical thinking, and problem -solving skills. These are the defined according to student daily work and presenting relevant knowledge, including discussions between students and facilitator. For critical thinking and problem-solving skills, industrialization tools such as 5M and 5 Whys analysis tools were the introduced to the students as an extra curriculum for students need to summit the innovative solution within 4 weeks after training. Finally, students were the assessed the required learning outcomes, which it comprised 3 parts. The first is student development assessment or formative assessment. The second part was self-assessment. The third part was outcome assessment comprised teacher, head of job in industrial, and facilitator gave feedback and mark. The overall quantitative evaluation found that students can perform outstanding the critical thinking and problem -solving skills of 55.7% whereas they can perform moderate only of 7.6%. The extra curriculum based on work experience was designing and organized. Facilitator was the key for student development of critical thinking and problem -solving skills, which are essential for improving work efficiency. Then evidence suggests that students can fill in the skills gaps which relate to industrial development based on innovative driven enterprise.

TI  - A Multi-Project Evaluation of Engineering Students' Performance for Online PBL: Taking the Sustainable Decision Analysis Course as an Example
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In order to meet the growing demand for engineering professionals who can incorporate sustainable solutions into their work, sustainability courses have been launched in online problem-based learning (PBL) environments through various real-life projects. Nonetheless, the conventional one-off grading approach may fail to capture the intricate variations in students' performance across different projects. To address this problem, a multi-project evaluation framework utilizing the probability exceedance method (PEM) is proposed, which can fuse linguistic evaluation data presented in probability distributions without the need to obtain weights of criteria. In the case study, a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of students majoring in engineering management is conducted within a study group over an online PBL course on sustainable decision analysis. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that consistent scores can be achieved after assigning different values of fuzzy measures to each criterion. This study enables teachers to holistically evaluate students without being bound by rigid numerical standards or strict weighting schemes, thus allowing them to focus on other educational tasks while ensuring effective and reliable results. Moreover, it contributes to educational innovation by introducing a modern and comprehensive approach for engineering student assessment in online PBL, aligning with the evolving needs of educational sustainability in higher education.

TI  - Problem-based Learning: Influence on Students' Learning in an Electrical Engineering Course
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
AB  - BACKGROUND
   Recently, there has been a shift from using lecture-based teaching methods in undergraduate engineering courses to using more learner-centered teaching approaches, such as problem-based learning. However, research on the impact of these approaches has mainly involved student perceptions of the teaching method and anecdotal and opinion pieces by faculty on their use of the teaching method, rather than empirically collected data on students' learning outcomes.
   PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS)
   This paper describes an investigation of the impact of problem-based learning (PBL) on undergraduate electrical engineering students' conceptual understanding and their perceptions of learning using PBL as compared to lecture.
   DESIGN/METHOD
   Fifty-five students enrolled in an electrical engineering course at a Midwestern university participated in this research. The study utilized a within-subjects A-B-A-B research design with traditional lecture as the baseline phase and problem-based learning as the experimental phase of the study. Participants completed pre- and post-tests surrounding the four topics covered in the study and also completed a Student Assessment of Learning Gains (SALG) survey.
   RESULTS
   Results suggested participants' learning gains from PBL were twice their gains from traditional lecture. Even though students learned more from PBL, students thought they learned more from traditional lecture. We discuss these findings and offer implications for faculty interested in implementing PBL.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Given the limited research on the beneficial effects of PBL on student learning, this study provides empirical support for PBL. We discuss findings from this study and provide specific implications for faculty and researchers interested in problem-based learning in engineering.

TI  - Student Assessment of Problem-based Learning: differences by gender
T2  - HISTORIA Y COMUNICACION SOCIAL
AB  - This research aims to evaluate the application of Problem Based Learning (PBL) methodology in response to students' gender. Numerous investigations observe differences in learning styles and strategies as for gender that can influence the assessment of a particular teaching method. After conducting a survey which evaluates the effectiveness of applied learning procedures, we find that despite contrast was made by equal average in most cases, the differences were not significant in terms of student gender in such assessment.

CP  - 27th Annual Conference on Frontiers in Education - Teaching and Learning in an Era of Change (FIE 97)
AB  - This paper describes a suite of flexible software tools (CoMMIT - Collaborative Multi-Media Instructional Toolkit) that provides computer support for a variety of educational models including cooperative, distance, and problem-based learning. Students using CoMMIT have worked both synchronously and asynchronously in a variety of domains. The CoMMIT system provides a comprehensive, collaborative learning environment that includes integrated modules for authoring, student learning, and student evaluation. This paper briefly introduces each of the three CoMMIT modules and focuses on the WWW-based student module using a problem-based learning (PBL) case to illustrate its functionality. The CoMMIT student module was recently used and evaluated against a paper-based PBL case that required students to collaborate on the design of an information system. An evaluation of the results is given.

TI  - Validation of the Tutotest in a hybrid problem-based learning curriculum
T2  - ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION
AB  - The Tutotest is one of the few structured instruments developed for the assessment of students' learning skills in a problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum. This study was designed to validate the Tutotest in a hybrid PBL curriculum. Forty-four tutors completed 370 evaluations on second to fourth year medical students at the end of the first semester in 2004 using the Chinese version of the Tutotest. There was significant correlation between global rating and Tutotest-C (r = 0.44, P < 0.001). The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.97. Two-week test-retest correlation coefficient was 0.85. Factor analysis revealed four factors, where three were similar to the factors of "effectiveness in group", "communication and leadership skills", and "respect for others" identified in the original Tutotest. "Hypothesis forming and testing" instead of "scientific curiosity" became the fourth factor in our data. Our study validated the Tutotest-C in a hybrid PBL curriculum and students from the Chinese educational system. The test-retest reliability measure with a 2-week interval at the end of the PBL tutorial confirmed the stability of the Tutotest, which has not been previously reported. Since most Asian medical schools adopted a hybrid PBL curriculum, a valid student evaluation instrument for this type of curriculum is valuable.

TI  - Bioanalytical Chemistry: Model for a Fully Integrated Problem-Based Learning Approach
T2  - ACTIVE LEARNING: MODELS FROM THE ANALYTICAL SCIENCES
CP  - 230th National Meeting of the American-Chemical-Society
AB  - This chapter describes an advanced analytical undergraduate elective at Northeastern University entitled "Bioanalytical Chemistry," which is based on the problem-based learning (PBL) model of instruction. Bioanalytical Chemistry has been offered three times (2001, 2004, and 2006) since 2001 to classes ranging in size from four to fourteen undergraduates. In this semi-structured experiential learning course, students work for a semester in teams of 3-5 members on genuine analytical research problems using research-grade analytical instrumentation. A number of learning techniques including weekly group meetings, job safety analyses, and reflective journals provide supportive scaffolding for students and the instructor, whose principal role is that of a facilitator and coach. Summative assessment data for the period 2001-2006 document the efficacy of this approach in promoting higher level cognitive learning and provide insight into how and why this methodology works.

TI  - Design and assessment of a hybrid chemical engineering laboratory course with the incorporation of student-centred experiential learning
T2  - EDUCATION FOR CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
AB  - This paper presents a comparative study of the effectiveness of traditional laboratory (TL) and open-ended project-based laboratory (PBL) in a hybrid chemical engineering laboratory course. The two laboratory modules were delivered using corresponding instruction methods, and their effects on intended highlevel learning outcomes and skill development were assessed by means of student performance and a specific Likert-style survey. The results show that the traditional laboratory based on behaviorist learning is both effective and efficient in enhancing knowledge acquisition and improving learning outcomes, particularly for content-intensive lab components, while the project-based laboratory based on constructivist learning, coupled with an authentic design component, is more effective in fulfilling high-level design-related learning outcomes and developing students with high-level engineering skills. The design component in the PBL was found to be the key to motivating students to seek seamless connection between practical design, pilot-scale laboratory, and underlying theories. The results also indicate that the sequential instruction and formative assessment methodology adopted in the PBL have brought about deep learning and high-level student satisfaction. Feedback from the survey could also be very valuable for the design of more effective, efficient, and sustainable learning pedagogy for engineering laboratory courses.

TI  - Problem-based learning: a student evaluation of an implementation in postgraduate engineering education
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
AB  - This paper presents the student evaluation of a problem-based learning (PBL) implementation in the postgraduate engineering curriculum of a public university in Brazil. This investigation adopts a qualitative and collaborative design, as suggested when the research objective is to study phenomena in their natural settings in terms of the meanings people bring to them and when the data collected cannot be statistically handled easily. To this end, an instructional method based on PBL principles and activities was implemented in an administration theory course during one semester. The data utilized in this paper derive from participant observation and an end-of-term questionnaire in which the students were asked to evaluate the instructional method, its advantages and disadvantages, comment on some of its features, and give improvement suggestions. The student evaluations show that the approach used was very satisfactory and may have promoted the acquisition of knowledge as well as the development of some desirable skills and attitudes, such as teamwork and communication skills and respect for divergent ideas. Despite the favourable outcomes, the conclusion about the viability of using this instructional method in the context in question still depends on further consideration of some institutional and teacher-related issues.

TI  - Evaluating the use of developmental action inquiry in constructing a problem-based learning curriculum for pre-registration nursing education in Hong Kong: a student perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
AB  - Background. Developmental action inquiry (DAI) was chosen as the change strategy for introducing problem-based learning (PBL) in a pre-registration nursing programme. The central task was to transform the tutor and student participants to become collaborators in this curriculum reconstruction project.
   Aim. This paper expounds the way in which the action inquiry was constructed and in light of students' feedback analysis, the way in which PBL has made a difference in student learning was evaluated.
   Design. Taking into consideration the change context and different group characteristics, the DAI was conducted in terms of two dynamically interlinked circles that formed partnerships between PBL core group members and tutors, and between tutors and students in coconstructing knowledge useful for PBL curriculum development.
   Findings. The findings of the student evaluation questionnaire reveal that the majority of students felt PBL made a difference to their expectations of self, the student group and the teacher role in creating a facilitative environment to enhance learning. However, there was a significant difference among individual student group responses. The students' positive and negative PBL experience in self-learning, tutor-student interaction, and group-learning were identified as crucial factors contributing to these group variations.
   Conclusion. The evaluation findings show that a paradigm shift from teacher-centred to student-centred learning, from valuing self-learning to co-operative group-learning, and from theory-based to practice-based learning occurred among the students. DAI was found to be an effective change strategy for transforming participants to become collaborators in searching for useful knowledge and coconstructing the PBL learning context.

TI  - An Integrated Approach to Chemical Engineering Undergraduate Curriculum Reform
T2  - DESIGN FOR ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
CP  - 7th International Conference on the Foundations of Computer-Aided Process Design (FOCAPD)
AB  - Sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF), three chemical engineering departments within the Texas A&M University System have made significant progress in their efforts to renew their curricula to address pressures of multi-disciplinary technological developments and the growing breadth of abilities and knowledge areas expected for competitive chemical engineering graduates. Three broad strategies to accomplish project goals have been implemented: (1) curriculum content reform and development; (2) student assessment activities, and (3) faculty development initiatives.
   The three strategies are being implemented through six key mechanisms:
   (i) Identifying and organizing curriculum development activities around four course strings to improve integration of learning outcomes and activities.
   (ii) Developing interlinked curriculum components to organize and reinforce core ideas in chemical engineering curricula.
   (iii) Using service learning in required chemical engineering courses.
   (iv) Integrating comprehensive assessment plans and processes throughout the chemical engineering curriculum and using the data to make and evaluate changes.
   (v) Offering faculty development activities to offer knowledge and development opportunities for chemical engineering faculty members.
   (vi) Sharing our experiences with audiences beyond the Texas A&M University System.
   In the course of the project, faculty incorporated innovative pedagogies, such as teams, cooperative learning, and project based learning. Faculty in a community-centered effort have developed outcomes and expectations for incoming students in the courses that comprise the four course strings. Web-based modules that span courses and application areas have been developed and are being integrated into core courses. Consistent conversations about continuous improvement and assessment plan engaged faculty in a collective effort for sustained change. This paper will discuss the outcomes and experiences of the three-year, NSF-sponsored project to reform chemical engineering undergraduate curricula.

TI  - A student assessment of the virtual interactive case tool for asynchronous learning (VITAL) and other self-directed learning formats - art. no. 11
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION
AB  - Objectives. This article describes a class project in which a student-created online tool for asynchronous study was compared with 2 nontechnological, problem-based learning formats. The objectives were to encourage self-directed skill development; to address learning style preferences; and to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the relative merits of electronic-based vs traditional problem-based learning (PBL) tools on knowledge and skills building.
   Methods. Students performed 3 PBL exercises for the same topic: completion of the electronic-based case; research and presentation of situational cases to peers; and creation of cases and answer keys for role-playing with junior students as patients. Educational outcomes and student perceptions from an online survey are reported.
   Results. Online case scores were similar to other PBL, examination, and course scores. Students felt that teaching their peers and creating cases built knowledge and skills more effectively than completing online cases. Furthermore, teamwork was preferred to working individually.
   Conclusion. This project gave students a balanced, enhanced knowledge perspective from 3 varied, engaging PBL formats; fostered peer teaching, mentoring, and technology skills; and created insights comparing web-based tools to other methods for autonomous lifelong learning.

TI  - Using Continuous Peer Evaluation in Team-Based Engineering Capstone Projects: A Case Study
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
AB  - Scholarship of Application. Background: Capstone courses constitute the culminating experience in engineering curricula. A core characteristic is the student team and project-based nature, with many team deliverables. The ensuing difficulty is to fairly assess the individual team member's contribution toward the team effort. Contribution: The method presented here is based on weekly peer evaluation of the individual team member's contribution, which subsequently yields a participation factor (PF), in turn scaling the team grade in accordance with the individual student performance. Intended Outcome: This method allows the timely adjustment of the individual student effort to match the group expectations and rewards high-performing students by making higher individual grades than the team average possible, while penalizing underperforming free riders by not benefiting from other student's performance. Application Design: The method allows students to continuously calibrate their own and their teammate's expectations and improve their peer score by adjusting their individual efforts. This feedback also requires students to practice professional communication, and in particular giving and receiving critical feedback, and thus is highly aligned with industry needs. Findings: Results evaluated over three iterations of the assessment process indicate a weak positive correlation (0.26) of the peer evaluation with the individual instructor-graded deliverables as well as the individual student grade point average (GPA, 0.23). Further, survey-based data indicate student agreement that the PF is a fair reflection of the individual performance, and a neutral perceived overall assessment system effectiveness, with reported primary barriers being the difficulty in assigning fair peer grades and of open, critical discussion.

TI  - LEARNING BY DOING - TEACHING-RESEARCH METHODS THROUGH STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN A COMMISSIONED RESEARCH-PROJECT
T2  - STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - Teaching research methods to social science undergraduates presents a number of dilemmas, including the development of effective means of providing students with practical research experience and the difficulty of engaging the interest of students in a subject which for many is not intrinsically appealing and to which some have a long-standing aversion.  One way of addressing these issues is to enable students to participate in a 'real' research project, often commissioned by an external agency.  Reports of this approach have demonstrated its benefits to student learning and have identified some logistical problems of project-based teaching.  This paper reports on a project-based research methods course which has been running for 5 years and which has some distinctive features:  unlike most such courses it is compulsory and is taken by a relatively large number of students; the research project is funded each year by a commissioning agency; considerable emphasis is placed upon the assessment of students' contributions to the research.  These distinctive aspects of the course are discussed in relation to one particular project in which students participated, a patient satisfaction study of an accident and emergency department, funded by a Regional Health Authority.  The results of a student evaluation of the learning benefits of involvement in this project are reported.  It is concluded that project-based learning of research methods on courses that are larger than those reported in the literature and which are compulsory can be beneficial to both students and commissioners, and that through detailed planning of student participation and formal assessment of students' research activities, some of the problems reported by those running such courses can be resolved.

TI  - Comparative Evaluation of PBL and Traditional Lecture-based Teaching in Undergraduate Engineering Courses: Evidence from Controlled Learning Environment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
AB  - Project and problem-based learning (PBL) has been widely recognised as an active, collaborative, cumulative and integrative learning approach that engages learners, motivates team creativity and centres on practical education. On the other hand, traditional lecture-tutorial teaching is often criticised for being a passive, surface learning and exam-focused approach. In spite of these evidence-based observations and claims over the years, the traditional lecture-tutorial teaching approach still dominates as the preferred teaching approach at Australian universities. This study sets up a control environment to compare these two teaching and learning approaches by analysing data from students' actual performance, course evaluation and expectation in two large undergraduate engineering courses in 2009 and 2010. The evidence reported in this study is broadly interesting in that both courses were taught by the same teaching staff using two entirely different learning and teaching approaches to the same cohort of students in the same semester within the same degree program. The analysis shows that there are significant differences between the students' actual performance, course evaluation and their expectation. Such conflicting differences may be some of the reasons that may negatively impact teaching staff deterring them from switching to PBL from traditional lecture-tutorial teaching.

TI  - Trends and research outcomes of technology-based interventions for complex thinking development in higher education: A review of scientific publications
T2  - CONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Complex thinking is a desired competency in 21st-century university students, so technology based teaching and learning strategies must be carefully considered when training them in complex reasoning skills. This systematic review aims to map research on the use of teaching and learning strategies supported by technology to enhance complex thinking skills in university students. This review reports results according to PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) guidelines. The search strategy was performed in June 2022 in Scopus and Web of Science databases. Of 151 records initially identified between 2018 and 2022, 32 papers were included in the final synthesis per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results of this review indicate that (1) tech-based strategies for complex thinking development are based on active learning approaches including problem-based learning, case based learning, collaboration-driven and discussion-based learning, project-based learning, assessment-and feedback-oriented activities, and mind mapping techniques; (2) most of the documented strategies were implemented in hybrid contexts; (3) traditional instructional materials commonly used for promoting higher order thinking skills such as reading assignments, videos, and eliciting/reflexive questions are still effective in fostering complex thinking when delivered through technology; and (4) custom-built technological development for complex thinking development software that incorporates emerging technologies is scarce at present. Further research is needed to document the interventions that train students interactively in complex thinking skills using Education 4.0 technologies.

CP  - 11th World Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics/13th International Conference on Information Systems Analysis and Synthesis
AB  - Recently, Performance Based Logistics (PBL) has been successfully implemented by the US military. Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology (CSIST) is attempting to build up its ability as the main logistics service provider of ROC military services. CSIST has performed several logistics support projects of military services, which can be classified as PBL services, but an objective and effective evaluation mechanism was rarely developed for measuring the performance of its logistics support.
   The purpose of this research is first, based on PBL-MSP class, to conduct expert's interview to establish the performance measurement criteria of logistics support and the hierarchy structure, then use Fuzzy Multi-Attribute Decision Making approach and the Questionnaire to generate the importance weights of measurement criteria for each level of hierarchy structure, and finally develop the implementing process for rating the degree of satisfaction.
   In accordance with the weights and degree of satisfaction of each performance measurement criteria attached to PBL-MSP, an analysis is conducted to distinguish the view of points between the SCIST and military services. From the above results, SCIST can realize more about the real needs of its customer and how to play the role as a comprehensive logistics services provider.

TI  - A comparison of face-to-face and fully online problem-based learning: Student results and staff experiences, 2014-2020
T2  - HEALTH PROMOTION JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
AB  - Issue addressed Problem-based learning (PBL) is a student-directed pedagogy that promotes critical thinking, self-directed learning and communication skills essential for health promotion students and practitioners. This paper reports on student results, student evaluation and staff experience of PBL in the face-to-face and fully online environment in an undergraduate health sciences unit in an Australian university. Methods A single time-point study using quantitative and qualitative administrative student data (2014-2020) and narrative reflection from teaching academics (n = 5) was undertaken. Descriptive, independent t test and bivariate analyses for student results data were conducted; an inductive approach was used to analyse qualitative data and create codes. Results Student sample (n = 472) consisted face-to-face (n = 358, 75.8%) and online (n = 114, 24.2%) enrolments. Final Unit Mark was significantly higher for fully online students compared with face-to-face students in 2018 (P = .007) and 2019 (P = .001). Final Unit Achievement was significantly higher for fully online students compared with face-to-face students in 2018 (P = .017) and 2019 (P = .043). Three themes emerged: The PBL approach; Evolution of PBLs; Student skills and competencies. Discussion PBL allows students to learn through facilitated problem solving and strong collaborative skills. The face-to-face and fully online PBLs improved the student and academic staff experience, while supporting the development of critical thinking and self-directed research. Further, it supported students to develop their core health promotion competencies; and enhanced the online student learning experience. So what? Vital for contemporary, global graduates, the fully online PBL approach allows students to build critical academic and professional skills utilising current information technology relevant for collaborative professional practice.

TI  - Construct Validity of an Instrument for Assessment of Reflective Writing-Based Portfolios of Medical Students
T2  - ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
AB  - Purpose: Assessment of reflective writing for medical students is challenging, and there is lack of an available instrument with good psychometric properties. The authors developed a new instrument for assessment of reflective writing-based portfolios and examined the construct validity of this instrument.
   Methods: After an extensive literature review and pilot testing of the instrument, two raters assessed the reflective writing-based portfolios from years 2 and 3 medical students (n=135) on three occasions. The instrument consists of three criteria: organization, description of an experience and reflection on the experience. We calculated the reliability of scores using generalizability theory with a fully crossed design and two facets (raters and occasions). In addition, we measured criterion validity by testing correlations with students' scores using other assessment methods.
   Results: The dependability (F) coefficient of the portfolio scores was 0.75 using two raters on three occasions. Students' portfolio scores represented 46.6% of the total variance across all score comparisons. The variance due to occasions was negligible, while the studentoccasion interaction was small. The variance due to student-rater interaction represented 17.7%, and the remaining 27.7% of the variance was due to unexplained sources of error. The decision (D) study suggested that an acceptable dependability (F = 0.70 and 0.72) can be achieved by using two raters for one and two occasions, respectively. Finally, we found moderate to large effect-size correlations between students' scores in reflective writing-based portfolios and communication skills (r = 0.47) and PBL tutorials (r = 0.50).
   Conclusion: We demonstrated the presence of different sources of evidence that support construct validity of the study instrument. Further studies are warranted before utilizing this instrument for summative assessment of students' reflective writing-based portfolios in other medical schools.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of the Boundary-Layer Height from Lidar and the Weather Research and Forecasting Model at an Urban Coastal Site in the North-East Iberian Peninsula
T2  - BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY
AB  - We evaluate planetary boundary-layer (PBL) parametrizations in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical model, with three connected objectives: first, for a 16-year period, we use a cluster analysis algorithm of three-day back-trajectories to determine general synoptic flow patterns over Barcelona, Spain arriving at heights of 0.5, 1.5, and 3 km; to represent the lower PBL, upper PBL, and lower free troposphere, respectively. Seven clusters are determined at each arriving altitude. Regional recirculations account for 54 % of the annual total at 0.5 km, especially in summertime. In the second objective, we assess a time-adaptive approach using an extended Kalman filter to estimate PBL height from backscatter lidar returns at 1200 UTC 30 min for 45 individual days during a seven-year period. PBL heights retrieved with this technique are compared with three classic methods used in the literature to estimate PBL height from lidar. The methods are validated against PBL heights calculated from daytime radiosoundings. Lidar and radiosonde estimated PBL heights are classified under objectively-determined synoptic clusters. With the final objective, WRF model-simulated PBL heights are validated against lidar estimates using eight unique PBL schemes as inputs. Evaluation of WRF model-simulated PBL heights are performed under different synoptic situations. Determination coefficients with lidar estimates indicate the non-local assymetric convective model scheme is the most reliable, with the widely-tested local Mellor-Yamada-Janjic scheme showing the weakest correlations with lidar retrievals. Overall, there is a systematic underestimation of PBL height simulated in the WRF model.

TI  - Medical problem based learning supported by intranet technology: a natural student centred approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS
CP  - 6th International Conference on Health and Medical Informatics Education
AB  - In response to the explosion in medical information, there have been considerable recent changes in medical curriculum development. The move to problem based learning (PBL) is, in part, a result of these changes. The Faculty of Medicine at the University of Sydney has exploited a WWW based intranet for the development, delivery, management and evaluation of it's problem based, graduate medical program (GMP). This system has been employed to develop the 72 medical problems that contribute to the first two years of the GMP. The activities of more than 400 members of the faculty have been coordinated using the intranet to develop the wide range of resources to support learning in the program. Daily management of the curriculum is also enabled using Web site posting of bulletins, e-mail and ongoing development of technology training. Coupled with the PBL problems is a formative assessment system that provides questions and feedback that cover the whole range of learning topics. Part of the student and staff evaluation is supported both informally and formally through the use of a 'Feedback' button on each web page and web delivered structured formal evaluations, respectively.

TI  - Strengthening the Comprehension Processes in Medical Students: Applying Problem-Based Learning Accompanied by the Reasoning Procedural Map
T2  - INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL OF PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING
AB  - A study was conducted on the cognitive processes involved in the steps of problem-based learning and the way this pedagogical approach is applied in the health sciences. The objective was to understand more deeply the cognitive process related to student comprehension and its connection with the work done when studying a medical discipline through problem-based learning (PBL). A case study was undertaken with a total of 30 students and an interdisciplinary team composed of a physician and two professionals in the field of education. After a video analysis process of face-to-face teamwork on PBL, it was decided to design and use an advanced organizer to systematize and ease the comprehension process while working with problem scenarios. From its initial application, the students were satisfied with its usefulness, and they provided feedback to improve its format and extend its applicability to other disciplines. It was concluded that not only is it possible to integrate hybrid models in problem-based learning, but also to include variants and auxiliary tools that arise from the cognitive demands and the information management needs of the students, thus favoring the study and the preservation of knowledge.

TI  - The ATLAS Project: The Effects of a Constructionist Digital Laboratory Project on Undergraduate Laboratory Performance
T2  - ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION
AB  - Anatomical education is a dynamic field where developments in the implementation of constructive, situated-learning show promise in improving student achievement. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of an individualized, technology heavy project in promoting student performance in a combined anatomy and physiology laboratory course. Mixed-methods research was used to compare two cohorts of anatomy laboratories separated by the adoption of a new laboratory atlas project, which were defined as preceding (PRE) and following the adoption of the Anatomical Teaching and Learning Assessment Study (ATLAS; POST). The ATLAS project required the creation of a student-generated, photographic atlas via acquisition of specimen images taken with tablet technology and digital microscope cameras throughout the semester. Images were transferred to laptops, digitally labeled and photo edited weekly, and compiled into a digital book using Internet publishing freeware for final project submission. An analysis of covariance confirmed that student final examination scores were improved (P < 0.05) following the implementation of the laboratory atlas project (PRE, n = 75; POST, n = 90; means +/- SE; 74.9 +/- 0.9 versus 78.1 +/- 0.8, respectively) after controlling for cumulative student grade point average. Analysis of questionnaires collected (n = 68) from the post group suggested students identified with atlas objectives, appreciated the comprehensive value in final examination preparation, and the constructionism involved, but recommended alterations in assignment logistics and the format of the final version. Constructionist, comprehensive term-projects utilizing student-preferred technologies could be used to improve performance toward student learning outcomes. Anat Sci Educ 8: 12-20.

TI  - Differences in personalized learning practice and technology use in high- and low-performing learner-centered schools in the United States
T2  - ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The Every Student Succeeds Act supports personalized learning (PL) to close achievement gaps of diverse K-12 learners in the United States. Implementing PL into a classroom entails a paradigm change of the educational system. However, it is demanding to transform traditional practice into a personalized one under the pressure of the annual standardized testing while it is unclear which PL approaches are more likely to result in better academic outcomes than others. Using national survey data of ELA teachers in identified learner-centered schools, this study compared high and low-performing learner-centered schools (determined by their standardized test results) in terms of their use of five PL features (personalized learning plan, competency-based student progress, criterion-referenced assessment, project- or problem-based learning, and multi-year mentoring) and their use of technology for the four functions of planning, learning, assessment, and recordkeeping. Generally, teachers in high-performing schools implemented PL more thoroughly and utilized technology for more functions than those in low-performing schools. Teachers in high-performing schools more frequently considered career goals when creating personal learning plans, shared the project outcomes with the community, and assessed non-academic outcomes. They stayed longer with the same students and developed close relationships with more students. Also, they more frequently used technology for sharing resources and reported having a more powerful technology system than those in low-performing schools. This study informs educators, administrators, and researchers of which PL approaches and technology uses are more likely to result in better academic outcomes measured by standardized assessments.

CP  - 6th IEEE World Engineering Education Conference (EDUNINE) - Rethinking Engineering Education After COVID-19 - A Path to the New Normal / Smart Distributed Conference
AB  - Universities advocate the application of Problem-Based Learning as a didactic strategy to deal with real problems, stimulating the development of problem-solving skills and attitudes. The research contemplates the survey technique using the questionnaire as an instrument. The case study is the subject Electronic Business developed during the semesters of 2019 B and 2020 B in the laboratory sessions. Some previous results and the results of the present work are shown, which reveal the greater degree of impact of applying PBL by students in the development of competences in the area of Systems Engineering. In conclusion, it is possible to identify the competences developed to solve problems that are acquired by the students when applying PBL in the laboratory sessions of the subject under study and thus help to reduce the gap that may sometimes exist between training at university and professional practice in organizations.

TI  - Assessment of student learning in a hybrid PBL capstone seminar
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - Assessment is a key component of the learning process. In order to maximize student learning, instructors need to provide students with appropriate, explicit and timely assessment. Despite the potential benefits of problem-based learning, some instructors may be reluctant to adopt this approach because it will require them to modify their current assessment practices. In problem-based learning curricula, assessment should be used to encourage and reward student participation throughout the course. This paper presents an analytical rubric developed for diagnosis of student learning via formative assessment in a capstone environmental impact analysis course. The use and role of the analytical rubric in student grading is also explained. This rubric provides a template for how student learning could be assessed in other courses in geography curricula that employ a similar student-centred approach to learning.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 IEEE GLOBAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION CONFERENCE (EDUCON 2020)
CP  - IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (IEEE EDUCON)
AB  - In the existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) teaching models for technical University students, the information system based courses are currently dominated in most of the teaching programs and teaching materials, although there are detailed and complete system procedures provided by the system providers, but the learning assessment results is still unsatisfactory. The companies are not satisfied with the ERP practical skills and basic concepts of the graduating students, the skill gap between the schools and workplaces on ERP are still exist. Therefore, the theme of this study is to apply problem-based learning (PBL) as the design spirit of situational case, ERP teaching plan and the compilation of textbooks, to evaluate the effect of PBL methods on ERP courses teaching, and then design suitable teaching materials and curriculum plans for the technical University students. The problem design strategies and examples of PBL-ERP course and textbook are described, and the students' learning effectiveness are evaluated with a pre- and-post test of problem-solving ability inventory (PSAI), where the results show positive ascension in all aspects, especially in the motivation and confidence to solve problems.

TI  - Assessment strategy for an engineering problem-solving course
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
AB  - The operational aspects of an assessment strategy for an Engineering Problem-Based Learning (PBL) course initially involved an audit of existing and varied student skills and competence to facilitate their effective deployment into well-balanced teams. This balance encourages effective mentoring within and between teams. The strategy included summative and formative assessment, the former being tailored to individual students' existing skill levels. Throughout, the emphasis is on advancement of skills and competence rather than simply achieving a minimum standard The strategy provides the flexibility for equitable assessment of students with different initial skills and competency, which proves particularly relevant to students studying in the distance made who may have considerable professional experience and advanced skills and competence in some areas. By tracking progress, students develop an individual portfolio of achievements that can be continued throughout their study programmes and professional lives.

TI  - Assessing Competency in Practice-Based Learning: A Foundation for Milestones in Learning Portfolio Entries
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION
AB  - BACKGROUND: Graduate medical education is undergoing a dramatic shift toward competency-based assessment of learners. Competency assessment requires clear definitions of competency and validated assessment methods. The purpose of this study is to identify criteria used by surgical educators to judge competence in Practice-Based Learning and Improvement (PBL&I) as demonstrated in learning portfolios.
   METHODS: A total of 6 surgical learning and instructional portfolio entries served as documents to be assessed by 3 senior surgical educators. These faculty members were asked to rate and then identify criteria used to assess PBL&I competency. Individual interviews and group discussions were conducted, recorded, and transcribed to serve as the study dataset. Analysis was performed using qualitative methodology to identify themes for the purpose of defining competence in PBL&I. The assessment themes derived are presented with narrative examples to describe the progression of competency.
   RESULTS: The collaborative coding process resulted in identification of 7 themes associated with competency in PBL&I related to surgical learning and instructional portfolio entries: (1) self-awareness regarding effect of actions; (2) identification and thorough description of learning goals; (3) cases used as catalyst for reflection; (4) reconceptualization with appropriate use and critique of cited literature; (5) communication skills/completeness of entry template; (6) description of future behavioral change; and (7) engagement in process identifies as personally relevant.
   CONCLUSIONS: The identified themes are consistent with and complement other criteria emerging from reflective practice literature and experiential learning theory. This study provides a foundation for further development of a tool for assessing learner portfolios consistent with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's Next Accreditation System requirements.

TI  - Upskilling of Pharmacy Faculty in an Accredited Institution through Modular Training in Strategic Education Practices with Formative and Summative Assessments
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
AB  - Aim: To study the impact of Modular Faculty training on the attitude of faculty, motivation towards self-directed learning and team learning. Train the faculty on new teaching and learning tools and assessment. Assess the faculty continuously and after the completion of the training and distribute certificates as per the requirements informed in advance. Materials and Methods: Thirty two (32) faculty of an accredited college were enrolled in a 4 credit course consisting of 15 Modules with 60 contact hr workshop based program spread over about 06 months or 01 semester. Each workshop was of 4 to 5 hr face to face interaction, including pre and post-tests, activities, presentations, discussions, reflections, flash card PPT and feedback. Important modules included were how to write good Learning Outcomes, Problem Based Learning (PBL), Blooms taxonomy, Soft skills, Leadership, Quality assurance and Academic advising to name a few. Formative assessment of 60% included Quiz, Assignment and mid module exam and summative assessment consisted of end module exam for 40% with MCQ's and RRE's (Restricted Response Essay). A minimum of 70 % was assigned a C grade, 80% for B grade and 90% and above for A grade. Results: Twenty-seven faculty (27), 84% completed the training and were awarded the certificate at a public function. Participants rated the program as effective, useful and need based. Average age of faculty in Indian pharmacy colleges is 32 to 34 and without any formal training in teaching and learning. Conclusion: Average pretest score in all the training modules was 4.2 and in post-tests the score rose to 9.6, indicating very clearly that training and upskilling was effective and raised the knowledge, skill and attitude of the participants. Institution paid a nominal fee for the training program, assessment and certification. As of now, in India there is no formal, modular and certificate based training imparted to faculty in about 2000 pharmacy colleges. If they are trained and upskilled, they will be able to impart more effective education and thereby transform the teaching and learning process in the pharmacy colleges.

AB  - The accurate simulation of PBL dynamics is the most critical aspect of meteorological physics for air quality modeling. In this work, the performance of WRF meteorological model in three different types of high-O-3 episodes (Saavedra S. Characterization of tropospheric ozone episodes in Galicia by applying different simulation techniques and interpretation of field data. Ph. Degree thesis (in Spanish), University of Santiago de Compostela, 2010) in the northwest region of the Iberian Peninsula (IP) is evaluated. Four different planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes were tested. Surface temperature and wind (speed and direction) simulation results were compared to hourly measurements at 10-m meteorological towers. Following statistics proposed by Emery (Enhanced meteorological modeling and performance evaluation for two Texas ozone episodes. Prepared for the Texas natural resource conservation commission, by ENVIRON international corporation, 2001) for wind speed and temperature, the best model performance is achieved using the Yonsei University (YSU) scheme; Asymmetric Convective Model (ACM2) is more suitable for temperature, and Mellor-Yamada Nakanishi and Niino Level 2.5 PBL (MYNN) are better for wind speed.

TI  - Developing and evaluating the student assessment system in the preclinical problem-based curriculum at Sherbrooke
T2  - ACADEMIC MEDICINE
AB  - Background. Students' learning was used as an outcome measure in the first phases of the major curriculum reform started in 1987 by the University de Sherbrooke Faculty of Medicine, which shifted from a traditional to a student-centered, problem-based learning (PBL) and community-oriented program. The system for evaluating preclinical students' learning is intended to reinforce the integration of basic and clinical sciences.
   Method. To discover whether the evaluation system was fulfilling its intended goals, the authors used data from the classes of 1991-1993 to assess the reliability and validity of three evaluation instruments. The three instruments were (1) written examinations composed of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), short-answer questions (SAQs), and problem-analysis questions (PAQs); (2) PBL tutor rating forms that evaluate students' reasoning skills, communication and group-interaction skills, and autonomy and humanism; and (3) clinical skills evaluations, including objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs). The weights allocated to the instruments reflected how the faculty valued each evaluation dimension in each of the three phases of the preclinical curriculum.
   Results. Reliability indexes improved throughout the system implementation. The written examinations proved to have content validity according to PBL learning objectives. As evaluated by students, the PAQs were found to be at a taxonomic level that assessed ability to analyze information a third of the time in the first year of implementation of the PBL curriculum and 17% in the second year. Variations and correlations of students' mean performances across instructional units and between the evaluation instruments led to the development of a student longitudinal performance profile to be used before yearly promotion decisions are proposed, The profile was introduced in the fifth year of PBL implementation.
   Conclusion. The system allows students to learn higher-taxonomic-level content and fulfills the institution's social responsibility of judging program outcomes and promoting qualified students, although evaluation by PBL tutors is still psychometrically questionable and the measurement of students' reasoning and ability to analyze problems is still an unfinished evaluation task.

TI  - Combining course- and program-level outcomes assessments through embedded performance assessments at key courses: A proposal based on the experience from a Japanese dental education program
T2  - TUNING JOURNAL FOR HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - This paper addresses how to combine the course- and program-level assessments and presents a new method illustrated by a case of dental education program in Japan. Performance assessments are considered effective for evaluating knowledge integration and higher-order skills, while placing a burden on faculty, hence their feasibility as the program-level assessment is regarded lower than standardized tests or questionnaire surveys. We have developed several performance assessments at the course level, such as Modified Triple Jump for the PBL course. Based on this experience, we propose Pivotal Embedded Performance Assessment (PEPA) as a method for combining assessment at the course and program levels. The method limits the range of performance assessment to key courses directly linked to program goals and placed at the critical juncture points of curriculum, while entrusting the assessment of other courses to expert judgment of individual teachers. PEPA consists of the following procedures: systematization of curriculum and selection of key courses; design and implementation of performance assessments by a faculty team; setting passing criteria with incorporating the function of formative assessment; certifying the completion of the degree program. PEPA thus enables maintaining assessment feasibility and compatibility with a credit system, while ensuring assessment validity and reliability.

Design/methodology/approach The model consists of four stages. In the first stage, a criteria set to evaluate alternatives is created. In the second stage, the DEA-MTFP index method is applied for performance evaluation of the alternatives by using crisp data. In the third stage, IFS theory is utilized for aggregating decision-maker judgments on alternatives, and in the last stage, the results of both methods are turned into single value, and it is selected as the most suitable alternative. Findings It is verified that the proposed approach can be implemented to the real-life dynamic multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem that have crisp and fuzzy data under the PBL strategy. Practical implications This paper offers an integrated approach for performance analysis of service providers in a dynamic MCDM problem in which crisp and fuzzy data are used together. To illustrate applicability and validity of the proposed model, it is applied to a real-life problem. Originality/value This paper utilizes the DEA-MTFP index method and IFS theory in an integrated way.

TI  - Student assessment of a problem-based learning experiment in civil engineering education
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL ISSUES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
AB  - This paper describes an experiment with problem-based learning (PBL), an instructional methodology used in response to the challenges posed by today's professional education. Contrary to the conventional model that places an application problem after concepts or topics have been introduced, PBL uses the problem to initiate learning. Besides promoting the construction of knowledge, it may also contribute to the development of some skills and attiudes deemed important for engineers' professional practice. This research, of a qualitative nature, intended to investigate how students evaluate this methodology and its potential to attain the educational goals set for the course. In order to answer the research question, the methodology was implemented in the civil engineering curriculum of a Brazilian public university. The results herein presented, deriving mainly from classroom observations and an end-of-course questionnaire, show that most of the students evaluate the methodology positively. Even considering the short duration of the course and its small number of credits, it may also have promoted the development of some skills and attitudes besides knowledge acquisition.

TI  - The semi-structured triple jump - a new assessment tool reflects qualifications of tutors in a PBL course on basic pharmacology
T2  - NAUNYN-SCHMIEDEBERGS ARCHIVES OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - In spite of major efforts, there are only a few assessment tools reflecting learning outcomes particularly attributed to problem-based learning (PBL). We aimed to design a more appropriate assessment method by merging elements of the key features and the triple-jump approach. In a prospective, two-phase study, we designed and validated a new assessment tool, called the semi-structured triple jump (sTJ). At the end of a course on basic medical pharmacology, it was performed in addition to a final exam composed of multiple-choice questions. Since in a previous study we had shown tutor expertise to influence students' perception of the learning process, we examined the effect of tutor expertise on results obtained with these assessment tools. We newly developed a questionnaire for student evaluation of the PBL learning process that was validated and tested for reliability. Our aim was to answer two major questions: (1) Does our newly designed assessment tool come up with methodical claims like validity, objectivity and reliability? (2) Does our newly designed assessment tool reflect differences in tutors' expertise? The semi-structured triple jump turned out to be a valid and highly objective assessment tool showing a moderate reliability as found with other triple-jump modifications before. Interestingly, several steps of the sTJ showed a significant correlation to either tutors' subject- or method-matter expertise, respectively. Our data support the approach of supplementing the assessment by structured case-based tools to make it more appropriate for PBL.

TI  - Comparison of learning outcomes: Team-based vs. problem-based learning with high-Fidelity simulation in a critical care nursing course-a mixed-methods design
T2  - NURSE EDUCATION TODAY
AB  - Background: Few studies have evaluated the comparative effectiveness of team-based learning (TBL) and problem-based learning (PBL) combined with simulation in nursing education. Objective: This study aimed to compare the learning outcomes of TBL versus PBL, incorporating high-fidelity simulation (HFS) in a critical care nursing course. Methods: This study used a mixed-methods design with convenience sampling. Senior baccalaureate nursing students from a university of science and technology were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to the TBL or PBL group by class, each receiving their respective teaching strategies combined with HFS. Course outcomes were assessed using a variety of instruments, including a learning assessment (shock knowledge, Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support knowledge, and a final test), the Satisfaction with Simulation Experience Scale (SSES), the Confidence Scale, the Emergency Preparedness Simulation Learning Experience Scale (EPSLES), the Learning Experience Questionnaire, and a demographic questionnaire. Results: A total of 173 senior nursing students were included. A One-way ANCOVA was utilized to control for pretest and midterm test scores when comparing the learning effects. The analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in post-test shock knowledge scores between the two groups (F = 4.51, p = 0.04). The TBL group achieved significantly higher post-test scores compared to the PBL group. In contrast, following the HFS program, the PBL group showed significantly higher mean scores on the SSES and EPSLES than the TBL group (t = 2.09, p = 0.04; t = 2.59, p = 0.01, respectively). Conclusion: Our study evaluated the effectiveness of mixed teaching strategies in a critical care nursing course. Findings indicate that both TBL and PBL enhance learning outcomes. The TBL group demonstrated superior performance on the learning outcomes test, while the PBL group excelled in simulation satisfaction and emergency simulation learning experiences. These results provide insights for selecting appropriate teaching strategies in intensive care education for nursing students.

TI  - Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection Using Projection Based Learning Meta-cognitive RBF Network
T2  - 2013 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)
CP  - International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)
AB  - In this paper, we present an approach for the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans with Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) detected features using Projection Based Learning (PBL) algorithm for a Meta-cognitive Radial Basis Function Network (McRBFN) classifier. McRBFN emulates human-like meta-cognitive learning principles. As each sample is presented to the network, the McRBFN uses the estimated class label, the maximum hinge error and class-wise significance to address the self-regulating principles of what-to-learn, when-to-learn and how-to-learn in a meta-cognitive framework. Initially, McRBFN begins with zero hidden neurons and adds required number of neurons to approximate the decision surface. When a neuron is added, its parameters are initialized based on the sample overlapping conditions. The output weights are updated using a PBL algorithm such that the network finds the minimum point of an energy function defined by the hinge-loss error. Moreover, as samples with similar information are deleted, over-training is avoided. The PBL algorithm helps to reduce the computational effort used in training. For simulation studies, we have used MR images from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) data set. The performance of the PBL-McRBFN classifier is evaluated on complete morphometric features set obtained from the VBM analysis. The performance evaluation study clearly indicates the superior performance of PBL-McRBFN classifier over other classification algorithms.

TI  - THE PBL EXPERIENCES IN SCIENTIFIC & HEALTH EDUCATION AT UNIVERSITY LEVEL WITH ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE
T2  - 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI 2012)
CP  - 5th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)
AB  - Background:
   Problem-Based Learning (PBL) has become the latest fashion trend for classroom learning, especially in the medical field. There have been numerous researches in exploring the effectiveness of PBL.
   Problem-based learning (PBL) is a student-centered pedagogy in which students learn about a subject in the context of an authentic problem, given by an instructor; the problem is the vehicle with which students learn. The problem is the starting point of teaching and learning and new knowledge is learned in the process of solving the problem. It aims to promote critical-thinking skills, group work and most importantly filling in the gap between "theory-practice". This study takes place at The University of Hong Kong at the course of CCST 9005 while most students have Cantonese as their mother-tongued with English as the second language. It is conducted in Sep 2010.
   Objectives:
   The purpose of this paper is to provide a PBL experience in scientific and health setting in undergraduate program as well as assessing the effectiveness of this delivery. In addition, it serves to evaluate the effectiveness of PBL learning where English is a second language in the region.
   Method:
   Students are allocated into groups with group number not more than 12 in small classroom teaching. The PBL learning is conducted during tutorials with five problem-based case scenarios being discussed throughout the semester. Every week constitutes one tutorial class spanning two hours. Students are expected to finish one case scenario in two tutorials and submitted a group report after completion of each case discussion.
   A group leader is appointed in the beginning of each class to lead the discussion and a secretary is appointed to hold minutes. A facilitator/instructor acts as a background audience and probes and challenges the students and provides guidance for them at times.
   Discussion and Conclusion:
   Many students are experiencing PBL learning in the first time of their education, yet we are receiving very positive feedback. Overall, students from our course CCST 9005 have provided favorable and promising responses in the Student evaluation of Teaching and Learning Questionnaire as well as our own course questionnaire. When asked to rate the usefulness of the PBL tutorials in helping them to understand the issues of science and health, 93.4% of students rate score 7 and above in a 10 point scale (1-worst, 10-best) with 0% rating score 5 and below. 20% of the students rated a score of 6 and 40% of students rated a score of 8 and 9. Generally, we seem to have achieved what we lay out to achieve initially (enhance critical-thinking skills, group work, filling in the gap of theory-practice). However, facilitator has come to notice that acquisition of prior knowledge of the case scenario is very important for students. Students should have certain background knowledge in order to engage in a fruitful discussion. In addition, different students/tutorial groups perform differently due to their acquisition of prior knowledge. For future goers in implementing PBL in their teaching practice, it would be a point to ponder on in designing PBL problem catering for their respective audience. Though English is a second language for many Hong Kong students, it does not affect the benefit of PBL teaching and many students have relatively good command of English.

TI  - Problem-based learning method in the context of a flipped classroom: Outcomes on pain management course acquisition
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC SCHOLAR
AB  - Introduction: A deep understanding of physiology, physiopathology, pharmacology, and the management of pain is crucial for nurse anaesthetists to ensure the well-being of their patients. Thus, the teaching strategies should enhance the transition from acquiring the fundamental pain phenomena, to developing translational and critical thinking. The aim of the study is to determine if the flipped classroom that is considered an active learning approach is most effective compared to the traditional method in teaching pain management and if it improves students' academic performance. Methods: This study was quasi experimental, at a higher institute of nursing professions, among third-year anaesthesia resuscitation nursing students. participants were randomly allocated into either: the flipped classroom group where PBL was used (FG, n = 19), or the traditional lecture-based classroom group (TG, n = 19). The results and impact of the above approach were appreciated via the analysis of the summative assessment of the class group and from the questionnaire submitted to students. Results: The present study revealed that in the midterm exam, the mean score of the flipped classroom group (14.0) which is significantly higher (p<0.01) than the traditional lecture group (11.9). Moreover, the standard deviation of this latter is slightly higher (2.41) which indicates scores far from the average. Also, a significant difference between the averages of the two approaches in favor of flipped classroom Group was revealed (p<0.01). Conclusion: The assessment of student's grades and their appreciation of both teaching approaches showed a preference for the PBL.

TI  - Investigating Undergraduate Students' Communication Self-Efficacy during an Engineering Design Course
T2  - 2017 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE)
CP  - IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)
AB  - Communication skills are an integral part of the development of undergraduate students as emerging professionals in rapidly changing, multi-disciplinary engineering fields. However, many engineering educators and industry employers continue to express concerns about the quality of these skills in engineering graduates. Many universities and institutions have enhanced engineering education curriculum, with a focus on developing communication skills through design courses and presentation activities. However, a consistent assessment or investigation of these skills remains elusive. One way to learn about students' communication skills is to monitor their self-efficacy in communication (i.e. their belief in their capability to communicate effectively). In this study, we discuss the results from a 32-item survey (subset of a 72-item survey) given to engineering students during the second (N = 103) and last week (N = 82) of a 10-week, hands-on engineering design course. 31 items on the survey were related to specific communication tasks such as explaining product details to customers, and the last item was related to general communication skills. A subset of the 31 items were grouped into two categories related to the audience with whom the students are communicating and the method of communication. A one-way ANOVA analysis, and paired t-tests were conducted to determine if the responses to the items within and across the themes were statistically different, and if there was a significant change in the students' self-efficacy from the second to last week of course. The correlation between the students' responses to general communication skills and specific communication activities were also compared. Students reported a significant increase in their self-efficacy in being able to communicate effectively. However, the data was more nuanced when the self-efficacy in the specific communication items and the grouped items were compared. Self-efficacy is believed to be an essential part of a person's attitudes, abilities, and cognitive skills. By using this assessment and investigation, we can begin to understand how the graduating engineers may approach goals, tasks and challenges related to communication in the real world.

TI  - Assessment in problem-based learning (PBL)
T2  - ANNALS ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE
AB  - Problem-based learning (PBL), a relatively new approach to teaching, has been introduced in several of the medical schools in the Southeast Pacific region. This approach emphasises active, self-directed learning and puts the emphasis on the individual student and his/her role ill the educational process. It is well known that assessment plays a large role in influencing student learning behaviour. Therefore, it is important that the assessment process not hamper learning or adversely affect attainment of the goals of the curriculum. If student behaviours are directed toward achieving success on the assessments, instructors' efforts to create a climate of self-directed learning and individual responsibility will be frustrated. This article provides information on the different classes of assessment vehicles available to assess the various domains of medical competence. We pay special attention to the critical relationship between the educational goals of problem-based learning and the different assessment instruments used. We briefly describe some assessment instruments and how it can relate to these goals in a positive manner. We conclude that no assessment instrument is ideal and that each has unique inherent deficiencies. As a consequence, a successful student assessment process requires use of several complementary instruments.

TI  - Meta-cognitive RBF Network and its Projection Based Learning algorithm for classification problems
T2  - APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB  - 'Meta-cognitive Radial Basis Function Network' (McRBFN) and its 'Projection Based Learning' (PBL) algorithm for classification problems in sequential framework is proposed in this paper and is referred to as PBL-McRBFN. McRBFN is inspired by human meta-cognitive learning principles. McRBFN has two components, namely the cognitive component and the meta-cognitive component. The cognitive component is a single hidden layer radial basis function network with evolving architecture. In the cognitive component, the PBL algorithm computes the optimal output weights with least computational effort by finding analytical minima of the nonlinear energy function. The meta-cognitive component controls the learning process in the cognitive component by choosing the best learning strategy for the current sample and adapts the learning strategies by implementing self-regulation. In addition, sample overlapping conditions are considered for proper initialization of new hidden neurons, thus minimizes the misclassification. The interaction of cognitive component and meta-cognitive component address the what-to-learn, when-to-learn and how-to-learn human learning principles efficiently. The performance of the PBL-McRBFN is evaluated using a set of benchmark classification problems from UCI machine learning repository and two practical problems, viz., the acoustic emission signal classification and the mammogram for cancer classification. The statistical performance evaluation on these problems has proven the superior performance of PBL-McRBFN classifier over results reported in the literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

TI  - DESIGN STUDIO REVIEW JUROR: CRITIC OR CONNOISSEUR?
T2  - 14TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED2020)
CP  - 14th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)
AB  - Design education is a specific setting that facilitates learning through lecturing, demonstrating and practicing. It relies heavily on project-based learning, studio-based learning, experiential learning, and public critique. Evaluating the quality of creative work in design education is unavoidably complex and controversial. Assessment involves fallible human judgment, especially in art and design. Studio assessment includes criticism, which is recognized as a form of design thinking. Criticism can be both formative and summative, and is best demonstrated in design education through the final studio review. This review event occurs at the end of a studio project. It is where students present their work to peers, faculty and invited external jurors. These jurors are either visiting faculty or practicing professionals. They are invited by the instructor as recognized experts in the discipline. But what level of expertise is required for a juror to successfully participate in this form of educational assessment?
   This paper discusses the roles of a design studio review juror and the levels of expertise needed to be in this position of authority. Where a critic is an expert who possesses experience, tacit knowledge, education, and reputation in the profession, a connoisseur tends to go above the minimum expert requirements. A connoisseur has established his personal evaluation criteria through years of insightful and calculated evaluation experience. He has developed the ability to make precise discriminations among complex qualities, to pay attention to the subtleties of an object or creative work.
   The argument is made that a design studio review juror does not need to understand fine distinctions and discriminations to be a critic in undergraduate lower level studios. In these studios, critics with a general level of expertise can catch small and obvious errors. However, the juror needs the ability of a connoisseur to participate successfully in graduate level reviews, when a student's discipline-specific skills and knowledge is high and minor errors are unlikely to be made. Students at this level are more advanced and are independent thinkers. An understanding of the fine distinction between a critic and connoisseur can aid educators in selecting the most appropriate juror for their design studio reviews.

TI  - A study on teaching gases to prospective primary science teachers through problem-based learning
T2  - RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the achievement of prospective primary science teachers in a problem-based curriculum with those in a conventional primary science teacher preparation program with regard to success in learning about gases and developing positive attitudes towards chemistry. The subjects of the study were 101 first year undergraduate students, who were in two different classes and who were taught by the same lecturer. One of the classes was randomly selected as the intervention group in which problem-based learning (PBL) was used, and the other as the control in which conventional teaching methods were used. The data were obtained through use of the gases diagnostic test (GDT), the chemistry attitude scale (CAS), and scales specific to students' evaluation of PBL such as the peer evaluation scale (PES), self evaluation scale (SES), tutor's performance evaluation scale (TPES) and students' evaluation of PBL scale (SEPBLS). Data were analysed using SPSS 10.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences). In order to find out the effect of the intervention (PBL) on students' learning of gases, independent sample t-tests and ANCOVA (analysis of co-variance) were used. The results obtained from the study showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups in terms of students' GDT total mean scores and, their attitude towards chemistry, as well as PBL has a significant effect on the development of students' skills such as self-directed learning, cooperative learning and critical thinking.

The performance of the PBL-McRBFN classifier is evaluated on complete morphometric features set obtained from the VBM analysis and also on reduced features sets from Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The performance evaluation study clearly indicates the superior performance of PBL-McRBFN classifier over results reported in the literature.

TI  - Observational analysis of near-peer and faculty tutoring in problem-based learning groups
T2  - MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - ContextNear-peer and faculty staff tutors may facilitate problem-based learning (PBL) through different means. Near-peer tutors are thought to compensate for their lack of subject matter expertise with greater adeptness at group facilitation and a better understanding of their learners. However, theoretical explanations of tutor effectiveness have been developed largely from recollections of tutor practices gathered through student evaluation surveys, focus groups and interviews. A closer look at what happens during PBL sessions tutored by near-peers and faculty members seems warranted to augment theory from a grounded perspective.
   MethodsWe conducted an observational study to explore interactional practices during PBL tutorials at our medical school, at which near-peer tutoring of Year2 students is an established practice. Between October 2014 and May 2015, video-recordings were made of nine purposively sampled tutor groups using three tutor types (near-peer, clinical faculty and basic science faculty staff) across three systems-based units. An investigator team comprising a Year2 student, a Year4 student and a behavioural scientist independently analysed the videos until their observations reached saturation and then met face to face to discuss their detailed field notes.
   ResultsThrough constant comparison, narratives of tutor practices and group dynamics were generated for each of the nine tutor groups, representing the collective impressions of the members of the investigator team.
   ConclusionsVariation was greater within than across tutor types. Tutors' practices idiosyncratically and sometimes substantially diverged from PBL principles, yetall tutors attempted to convey authority or insider' status with respect to the short- and long-term goals of medical education. Students prompted these status demonstrations by expressing gratitude, asking questions and exhibiting analogous status demonstrations themselves. Understanding the socio-cognitive nature of tutoring from a grounded perspective may provide a means to develop faculty staff of all types to better meet learner needs in a principled fashion.

TI  - Sensitivity of WRF model estimates to various PBL parameterizations in different climatic zones over India
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
AB  - In the present work sensitivity of Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) Model has been carried out using five planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes - Yonsei University Scheme (YSU), Mellor-Yamada-Janjic scheme (MYJ), Aymmetric Convective Model version 2 (ACM2), Quasi Normal Scale Elimination scheme (QNSE), Mellor-Yamada-Nakanishi-Niino scheme (MYNN) in different climatic zones over India namely Tropical, Temperate and Arid for surface meteorological parameters, upper air variables and planetary boundary layer height during summer and winter season. The model outputs have been compared with observations through standard statistical measures. The aim is to study the relative performance of these schemes, selecting the best option climatic zone-wise and thereby minimizing uncertainty in model predictions. WRF model performance evaluation shows better agreement for temperature and relative humidity compared to wind speed. Overall for India, ACM2, QNSE show good performance for temperature and relative humidity whereas ACM2, MYNN show better performance for wind speed though these may vary for different climatic zones. Geopotential height and wind over 850 hPa is well simulated by ACM2 and MYNN over India. For PBL height ACM2, MYNN and MYJ works best for Chennai, New Delhi and Kolkata respectively during summer period. However, for winter period MYJ works best for Chennai while, QNSE works best for New Delhi and Kolkata. Considering all meteorological parameters together, it is seen that for arid zone ACM2, QNSE and MYJ schemes work reasonably well. For temperate zone, ACM2, QNSE and MYNN schemes show better results. For tropical zone all PBL schemes work closely. Hence, depending on the application, parameter and climate zone, this study provides suitable recommendations for choosing PBL schemes appropriately for each zone and parameter separately for the Indian region.

TI  - Student perceptions of tutor skills in problem-based learning tutorials
T2  - MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - Objective The problem-based learning (PBL) tutor plays a role that is different from the role of a teacher in a conventional teaching format. In the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates, all students are Arab nationals and tutors are expatriates with different sociocultural backgrounds from the students. This study was designed to investigate how students evaluate tutors in PBL tutorials and whether student evaluations of tutors change with the progress of students in PBL tutorials.
   Methods Differences in tutor performance evaluation by male and female students were also analysed. The students evaluated 12 tutor skills in a scale of 1-3, 1 being 'below average' and 3, 'outstanding'. Student responses from a total of 314 (98.1%) completed forms collected over 2 academic years were analysed statistically. A total of 14 tutors participated in the PBL programme.
   Results The analysis revealed that tutors as a group were rated as having average to outstanding tutor skills in 10 items of the evaluation form. Students and faculty perceptions were different for the tutor skills of guiding students for information management. The students expected more support from tutors, whereas the tutors tried to emphasize self-learning in the PBL curriculum. Lower scores to the tutors in the 'problem' bringing sociocultural and religious issues for discussion showed that a gap in sociocultural/religious understanding between students and tutors might influence tutor skills.
   Conclusions Differences in tutor evaluation by male and female students indicate necessity of adopting different strategies by tutors in a different sociocultural background. The results of the study have direct implications for faculty development.

TI  - Progress testing: critical analysis and suggested practices
T2  - ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION
AB  - Educators have long lamented the tendency of students to engage in rote memorization in preparation for tests rather than engaging in deep learning where they attempt to gain meaning from their studies. Rote memorization driven by objective exams has been termed a steering effect. Progress testing (PT), in which a comprehensive examination sampling all of medicine is administered repeatedly throughout the entire curriculum, was developed with the stated aim of breaking the steering effect of examinations and of promoting deep learning. PT is an approach historically linked to problem-based learning (PBL) although there is a growing recognition of its applicability more broadly. The purpose of this article is to summarize the salient features of PT drawn from the literature, provide a critical review of these features based upon the same literature and psychometric considerations drawn from the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing and provide considerations of what should be part of best practices in applying PT from an evidence-based and a psychometric perspective.

TI  - Not knowing that they do not know: self-assessment accuracy of third-year medical students
T2  - MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - PURPOSE The development of self-regulated learning is a major focus of our problem-based learning (PBL) medical programme. Students who are unsuccessful in assessments often seem to lack insight into the standard of their own performance, yet the ability to self-assess accurately is essential for the effective self-management of learning. The aim of this project was to evaluate the accuracy of self- and peer-assessment according to academic performance.
   METHOD In 2004, 175 3rd-year students undertook an integrated, case-based, short-essay, formative assessment. After the assessment they were provided with model answers and marking criteria. Students marked their own assessment paper and the paper of one of their peers. Assessment papers were subsequently marked by faculty members. The following data was available for each student: self-mark, faculty-mark, score awarded by a peer and the score that they awarded to their peer. Self-assessment and peer-assessment ability was compared to overall academic performance.
   RESULTS Low-achieving students score themselves and their peers generously. High-achieving students score themselves more harshly than faculty. However, they score their peers accurately.
   CONCLUSION In the 3rd year of the programme low-achieving students are unable to assess accurately the quality of their own work or the work of their peers in a formative written assessment. The PBL curriculum does not guarantee the appropriate development of self-assessment skills.

TI  - Global model simulation of summertime US ozone diurnal cycle and its sensitivity to PBL mixing, spatial resolution, and emissions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Simulation of summertime U.S. surface ozone diurnal cycle is influenced by the model representation of planetary boundary layer (PBL) mixing, spatial resolution, and precursor emissions. These factors are investigated here for five major regions (Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, California, and Southwest) by using the Model for Ozone And Related chemical Tracers version 2.4 (MOZART-2.4), with important modifications, to conduct sensitivity experiments for summer 1999 with three PBL mixing schemes, two horizontal resolutions and two emissions datasets. Among these factors, the PBL mixing is dominant. The default non-local scheme well reproduces the observed ozone diurnal variation, where the timing for the afternoon maximum and the morning minimum is within 1 h of the observed; biases for the minimum are less than 5 ppb except over the Southeast: and the ozone maximum-minimum contrast (OMMC) is within 10 ppb of observations except for the overprediction by 18.9 ppb over the Northeast. In contrast, the local scheme significantly overestimates the OMMC by 10-34 ppb over all regions as ozone and precursors are trapped too close to the ground. On the other hand, the full-mixing assumption underestimates the OMMC by 0-25 ppb, except over the Northeast, as the nighttime ozone decline is greatly underpredicted. As compared to PBL mixing, the effects of horizontal resolutions and precursor emissions being used are smaller but non-negligible. Overall, with the non-local mixing scheme, relatively high horizontal resolution (similar to 1.1 degrees) and updated emissions data, the modified MOZART is capable of simulating the main features of the observed ozone diurnal cycle.

TI  - Academic Performance in University Students in Morphological Science Courses: Use of Active Problem-Based Learning (PBL)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY
AB  - University education seeks to develop professional skills and capacities for autonomous learning. Active learning methodologies, centered on students, such as problem-based learning (PBL), could be very useful in improving academic performance in Basic Sciences courses in health and medical students. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of the use of the active problem-based learning methodology on the academic performance of university students who take morpho-biological courses in the Kinesiology and Obstetrics degree programs. From a total of 500 students who entered the first years of health degrees at the University of Tarapaca (academic year 2018), 100 students (over 18 years of age) were selected, separating as a control or non-intervened group (n = 50) to Obstetrics students and intervened group, with application of ABP (n = 50), students of the Kinesiology degree program. The study lasted 24 school weeks. The results show that the intervened group significantly improved academic performance, with 98 % approval and a final evaluation of 5.9. The control group achieved 84 % approval and a final evaluation of 4.8. It is concluded that the use of the active PBL methodology significantly improves the academic performance of health sciences students who take morpho-biological subjects and that activities with direct participation through questionnaires and group and individual scientific presentations, allow the student be their own agent of change in the educational assessment processes. It is suggested to implement this type of active methodologies in regular courses, also considering the psychological factors of learning.

TI  - Sensitivity of PBL parameterization schemes in simulating lightning and thunderstorm using WRF-ELEC model
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
AB  - Climate change's impact on lightning and thunderstorms is uncertain. This study evaluates the sensitivity of multiple Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) parameterisation schemes within the WRF-ELEC model for simulating a severe lightning and thunderstorm event in Bihar on 25 June 2020. The aim is to understand how these schemes affect lightning and thunderstorm intensity. The model was integrated for 54 h at 0000 UTC on 24 June 2020 using 6-hourly NCEP FNL Operational Global Analysis data at 1 degrees x1 degrees resolution over Bihar with double nested domains of 9 km (D1) and 3 km (D2). It effectively captures the peak lightning and thunderstorm activity from 0000 to 0900 UTC on 25 June 2020, significantly impacting certain regions. The study utilised ERA5 and IMDAA reanalysis datasets and NASA GPM IMERG daily data to analyse the event and assess the model's performance. Among the PBL schemes tested, ACM2, BouLac, SHsa, and MRF exhibit robust performance. Flash Origin Density (FOD) patterns broadly match observations, although occasional discrepancies occur in southern Bihar. Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) and precipitation (mm) analysis reveals anticipated trends. Statistical scores highlight strong performance by ACM2, UW, and GBM schemes in POFD/FAR. The MRF scheme excels in POD/Hit Rate, and the UW scheme achieves the highest score for 24-h accumulated total precipitation. HSS and GSS/ETS underscore the superior performance of the UW and GBM schemes. This study offers insights into lightning and thunderstorm simulations over Bihar with diverse PBL parameterisation schemes in the WRF-ELEC model.

TI  - Competition and Collaboration Using a Social and Gamified Online Learning Platform
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON GAMES BASED LEARNING
CP  - 10th European Conference on Games Based Learning
AB  - Gamification is defined as the use of game techniques in a non-game context and has demonstrated potential impact in a wide range of subjects. Informed by the design and processes of digital gaming, gamification often exploits competition to motivate, personified by points, badges and leader boards. Success, however, seems to go beyond these basic features and rely on a concrete acknowledgement of the motivational model of the user, taking into account concepts such as situational relevance and situated motivational affordance, which can be framed under competition and/or collaboration. This paper investigates the impact of competitive and collaborative environments on summative assessment. This study bases its investigation on the StarQuest platform (http://starquest.eu/), a social and gamified collaboration application hosting a private online environment for small groups of individuals to co-curate and share digital contents. Participants were second year undergraduate students (Sport Psychology, n=94), who enrolled on a module entitled "A Fundamental Approach to Motor Learning and Control". The module ran for 11 weeks and the curriculum was delivered using a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach. The results highlighted a number of strengths and weaknesses of implementing a gamified online platform for team working, which will inform future design, development and deployment of gamified and learning platforms.

TI  - Assessment in PBL-Do We Assess the Learner or the Product?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
CP  - 4th International Research Symposium on Problem Based Learning (IRSBL)
AB  - Grading individual students in teams or projects has always been problematic. To accurately gauge individual learning outcomes, students' grades need to be based on what they have learned as an individual within the team or project context. However, within engineering team-based projects, individuals have traditionally been assigned a grade heavily influenced by the team's project outcomes. Final year engineering projects (FYEP) suffer from similar problems. While typically in the Australian context, the projects are conducted by individuals, they are still conducted using the philosophy of PBL. To provide a reliable indicator of student capability and program quality and standards, FYEPs must be coherent, valid and reliable instruments for student assessment and program evaluation. This paper considers two Australian engineering education projects, one recently completed and one current, that investigate the issues of; how can individuals who learn in a team environment be assessed as individuals?, how can the outcomes from final year engineering projects be used to demonstrate the standards required by various state and professional accrediting agencies? And what are the issues that prevent staff effectively assessing the learning outcomes of individual students who learn in the project environment? The paper outlines an assessment model that was trialled and discusses the issues arising. The difference between this form of assessment and others in engineering education is that it assesses the learning outcomes of the individuals as opposed to assessing the product of the team. The paper also discusses the results from the first stage of data gathering on final year projects in Australia. The conclusion is that assessing the product rather than the learner degrades the opportunity to use projects as evidence of learning, but continues because it is easier for academic staff.

TI  - The Views of Undergraduates about Problem-based Learning Applications in a Biochemistry Course
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION
AB  - The effect of problem-based learning (PBL) applications in an undergraduate biochemistry course on students' interest in this course was investigated through four modules during one semester. Students' views about active learning and improvement in social skills were also collected and evaluated. We conducted the study with 36 senior students from the Faculty of Science at Dokuz Eylul University in Turkey. Pre- and post-tests were the primary tools used in this study and the Problem-Based Learning Assessment Scale was applied after each module to assess the students' views about the applications. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to determine students' pre- and post- attitudes toward the biochemistry course. According to the results, problem quality played an important role in students' academic achievement. The decreased orientation role played by the tutor toward the end of the PBL process showed that students could find the necessary information by investigating themselves, and associate new information and experiences with their existing knowledge. Additionally, results of semi-structured interviews indicated that their skills in the areas of working collaboratively in a group, fulfilling responsibilities and expression of ideas in a group also improved. In conclusion, it can be argued that PBL as an active learning approach is very effective for formation of knowledge, improvement in social skills and interest in a biochemistry course.

T2  - INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL OF PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING
AB  - Problem-based learning can have a great impact on the acquisition of practical knowledge, which is a central learning aim in the field of teacher education. Therefore, we implemented a problem-based learning approach in four seminars on educational assessment. In this paper, we outline our didactic design and discuss the results of the first evaluations, which explored acceptance of the approach, learning results, and expected applicability of the acquired knowledge.
   The results show benefits of the problem-based learning approach, but also room for improvement. Specifically, the use of problems from multiple contexts (theoretical foundations and direct practical application) and the flexible adaption to the learners' prior knowledge, methodological expertise, and learning goals need to be enhanced.

AB  - Background: The emergency medical services program at the College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, was adapted from the integrated problem-based learning curriculum of Flinders - University, Adelaide, South Australia.
   Purpose: The purpose of this article is to discuss the major adaptations required for adoption of the full-fledged PBL curriculum, use of sequential blocks, and multilayer alignment of the curriculum.
   Methods: A logical model and step-by-step approach were used to design the curriculum. Several studies using Delphi methods, focus group interviews, and expert opinions were performed to identify the priority health problems; related competencies, learning objectives, and learning strategies; the web-based curriculum for delivery; student assessment; and program evaluation.
   Results: Sixty priority health problems were identified for inclusion in different blocks of the curriculum. Identified competencies matched the satisfaction of different stakeholders, and ascertained learning objectives and strategies were aligned with the competencies. A full-fledged web-based curriculum was designed and an assessment was created that aligned with a blueprint of the objectives and the mode of delivery.
   Conclusion: Step-by-step design ensures the multilayer alignment of the curriculum, including priority health problems, competencies, objectives, student assessment, and program evaluation.

TI  - A Projection Based Learning in Meta-cognitive Radial Basis Function Network for Classification Problems
T2  - 2012 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)
CP  - International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)
AB  - In this paper, we propose a 'Meta-cognitive Radial Basis Function Network (McRBFN)' and its 'Projection Based Learning (PBL)' algorithm for classification problems. McRBFN emulates human-like meta-cognitive learning principles. As each sample is presented to the network, McRBFN uses the estimated class label, the maximum hinge error and class-wise significance to address the self-regulating principles of what-to-learn, when-to-learn and how-to-learn in a meta-cognitive framework. McRBFN addresses the what-to-learn by choosing samples to participate in the learning process, also deleting samples with information similar to that already learnt by the network. A few samples that satisfy neither of these criteria are pushed to the rear end of the training data stack to be used in future, thereby satisfying the when-to-learn. The how-to-learn component of meta-cognition is addressed by using the participating samples to either add a neuron or update the output weights. Initially, McRBFN begins with zero hidden neurons and adds required number of neurons to approximate the decision surface. When a neuron is added, its parameters are initialized based on the sample overlapping conditions. The output weights are updated using a PBL algorithm such that the network finds the minimum point of an energy function defined by the hinge-loss error. The use of human meta-cognitive principles ensures efficient learning. Moreover, as samples with similar information are deleted, overtraining is avoided. The PBL algorithm helps to reduce the computational effort used in training.
   The performance of the PBL-McRBFN classifier is evaluated using a set of benchmark classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository. The performance evaluation study on these problems clearly indicates the superior performance of PBL-McRBFN classifier over results reported in the literature.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of the WRF-Chem Model with Different Physical Parameterization Schemes during an Extremely High PM2.5 Pollution Episode in Beijing
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
AB  - To understand the impacts of different combinations of planetary boundary layer (PBL), short-wave (SW) and long-wave (LW) radiation schemes on the simulation results of meteorological variables and PM2.5 concentrations under extremely heavy pollution conditions, the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model was applied in Beijing to investigate a high PM2.5 pollution episode that occurred in January, 2013. Four PBL schemes, two SW schemes and three LW schemes with a total of 12 ensemble experiments were conducted in this study. The simulated meteorological variables including the temperature at 2 m (T2), the wind speed at 10 m (WS10) and the relative humidity (RH) were compared with their actual observations and the PM2.5 concentrations. A correlation analysis between the PM2.5 and T2, WS10 and RH values was also explored. The results indicated that there were no ideal scheme combinations that were most suitable for all meteorological variable simulations during this heavy pollution episode in Beijing. With the same emissions input, the simulation results of the WRF-Chem model that were configured with different physical parameterization schemes may vary significantly. As for the PM2.5 simulation, the combination of the YSU PBL, Goddard SW and GFDL LW schemes showed the greatest consistency with the observed values. Although the PBL schemes have the dominant impacts on the simulations of meteorological variables, the selection of LW and SW schemes is of the same importance.

TI  - Sequential Projection-Based Metacognitive Learning in a Radial Basis Function Network for Classification Problems
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
AB  - In this paper, we present a sequential projection-based metacognitive learning algorithm in a radial basis function network (PBL-McRBFN) for classification problems. The algorithm is inspired by human metacognitive learning principles and has two components: a cognitive component and a metacognitive component. The cognitive component is a single-hidden-layer radial basis function network with evolving architecture. The metacognitive component controls the learning process in the cognitive component by choosing the best learning strategy for the current sample and adapts the learning strategies by implementing self-regulation. In addition, sample overlapping conditions and past knowledge of the samples in the form of pseudosamples are used for proper initialization of new hidden neurons to minimize the misclassification. The parameter update strategy uses projection-based direct minimization of hinge loss error. The interaction of the cognitive component and the metacognitive component addresses the what-to-learn, when-to-learn, and how-to-learn human learning principles efficiently. The performance of the PBL-McRBFN is evaluated using a set of benchmark classification problems from the University of California Irvine machine learning repository. The statistical performance evaluation on these problems proves the superior performance of the PBL-McRBFN classifier over results reported in the literature. Also, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on a practical Alzheimer's disease detection problem. The performance results on open access series of imaging studies and Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative datasets, which are obtained from different demographic regions, clearly show that PBL-McRBFN can handle a problem with change in distribution.

TI  - Toward an Integrative Nursing Curriculum: Combining Team-Based and Problem-Based Learning with Emergency-Care Scenario Simulation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Objective: The study intended to combine team-oriented, problem-based learning (PBL) with emergency-care simulation to investigate whether an integrative intervention could positively impact the core nursing competencies and teacher performance of nursing students. Methods: The study belonged to the domain of action research, which aimed to address the weaknesses of traditional teacher-led, lecture-based learning. An 18-week, single-case experimental design, in which 58 senior nursing students at a medical university in central Taiwan participated, was conducted to test the possible benefits of the intervention. The measures included the Scale of Core Nursing Competencies and the Teacher Performance Evaluation Scale. Results: The research results showed that nursing students who received integrative training that combined team-based PBL with emergency-care scenario simulation had stronger mastery over core nursing competencies. At the same time, they also evaluated both the "Emergency Care" course for which the curriculum was used and the teachers' performance in that course more highly. Conclusions: The findings suggest that an integrative curriculum combining team-based PBL with scenario simulation is worth pursuing. Compared with traditional teacher-led, lecture-based teaching, this curriculum may be more effective in helping nursing students develop core competencies in their field.

AB  - The sensitivity of boundary layer variables to five (two non-local and three local) planetary boundary-layer (PBL) parameterization schemes, available in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale meteorological model, is evaluated in an experimental site in Calabria region (southern Italy), in an area characterized by a complex orography near the sea. Results of 1 km x 1 km grid spacing simulations are compared with the data collected during a measurement campaign in summer 2009, considering hourly model outputs.
   Measurements from several instruments are taken into account for the performance evaluation: near surface variables (2 m temperature and relative humidity, downward shortwave radiation, 10 m wind speed and direction) from a surface station and a meteorological mast; vertical wind profiles from Lidar and Sodar; also, the aerosol backscattering from a ceilometer to estimate the PBL height.
   Results covering the whole measurement campaign show a cold and moist bias near the surface, mostly during daytime, for all schemes, as well as an overestimation of the downward shortwave radiation and wind speed. Wind speed and direction are also verified at vertical levels above the surface, where the model uncertainties are, usually, smaller than at the surface. A general anticlockwise rotation of the simulated flow with height is found at all levels. The mixing height is overestimated by all schemes and a possible role of the simulated sensible heat fluxes for this mismatching is investigated. On a single-case basis, significantly better results are obtained when the atmospheric conditions near the measurement site are dominated by synoptic forcing rather than by local circulations.
   From this study, it follows that the two first order non-local schemes, ACM2 and YSU, are the schemes with the best performance in representing parameters near the surface and in the boundary layer during the analyzed campaign.

TI  - PBL in the undergraduate MD program at McMaster University: Three iterations in three decades
T2  - ACADEMIC MEDICINE
AB  - When the undergraduate MD program of McMaster University admitted its first cohort of 20 students in 1969, it heralded a major change in medical school pedagogy that has influenced the education of medical students around the world. The three-year PBL curriculum, which emphasized small-group tutorials, self-directed learning, a minimal number of didactic presentations, and student evaluation that was based almost entirely on performance in the tutorial, represented a radical departure from traditional curricula. Since the inception of the original curriculum in 1969, there have been two major curriculum revisions, the most recent of which was in 2005. The original curriculum attempted to integrate both basic science and clinical science into the biomedical problems. The second iteration of the curriculum focused on priority health problems and centered on a list of common medical problems as the foundation for curriculum organization, on the basis that an understanding of the management of common conditions included areas of knowledge that would be essential for clinical competence. Under the third, current curriculum, the COMPASS (concept-oriented, multidisciplinary, problem-based, practice for transfer, simulations in clerkship, streaming) model was adopted. Under this concept-based system, emphasis is placed on underscoring the underlying concepts in the curriculum with a logical sequencing of both the concepts and the body systems. This article briefly reviews the history of the development of the undergraduate MD program at McMaster and the three curricula that have been developed during the past three decades.

TI  - Learning styles and teaching techniques: an analysis on its effects on knowledge acquired
T2  - REVISTA AMBIENTE CONTABIL
AB  - Purpose: To verify if the students' learning styles impact the acquired knowledge, taking into account the application of teaching techniques in the classroom, specifically seeking to know if the subjects studied learn during the application of the technique.
   Methodology: A quasi-experiment in an undergraduate class at a Federal University, with a quantitative approach through the analysis of generalized mixed models.
   Results: It was found that learning styles do not interfere with student learning in case method and PBL techniques. However, in the Role-Play technique, it was found that learning styles interfered with student learning. It should be noted that the predominance was of the Assimilating style, followed by the Convergent and then the Accommodator. Students belonging to the accommodative style had a better performance compared to other students of the other styles.
   Contributions of the Study: it was observed that teaching techniques can contribute to knowledge, and that especially, more playful techniques such as Role-Play are favorable, but depend on the learning characteristics of each individual. In this way, the present study contributes to the knowledge in the aspect of indicating that the use of teaching techniques can produce satisfactory results, as long as the learning style of each student is perceived.

TI  - DOES USING VR IMPROVE STUDENT ASSESSMENT GRADES?
T2  - 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI2018)
CP  - 11th Annual International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)
AB  - Taxation students were introduced to the practical uses of taxation through a problem-based learning (PBL) approach, where they visited their "clients" premises through VR to identify eligible assets that they could claim capital allowances. Asset values were available during the visit and students subsequently completed a maximum value capital allowances claim.
   Students thoroughly enjoyed their VR taxation experience and feedback comments requested its further use in accounting learning. Pedagogic literature supports the view that if learning is fun then it is more likely to be memorable and will be easier for students to recall when needed for assessment purposes, but does it improve their grades? This research compared student grades for this specific assessment question and their overall grade on the final examination on a module of 200 final year undergraduate taxation students. Results support the question that VR does indeed improve student grades and hence its wider use in accounting education is to be encouraged.

TI  - Preliminary Analysis of Ground Based Lidar Backscattered Signal and Performance Evaluation in Penang Island
T2  - 2012 NATIONAL PHYSICS CONFERENCE (PERFIK 2012)
CP  - National Physics Conference (PERFIK)
AB  - Lidar is a widely used instrument by scientists around the world because of its high temporal and spatial resolution. With these characteristics, the interpretation of lower atmosphere behavior is improved, especially for the structure of the boundary layer, strongly related to air quality in the region. For the first time a backscattering lidar with wavelength 355 nm and Raman capabilities produced by Raymetrics was operated in Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) in Penang Island. Due to operational constraints, this study will only discuss backscattering signal at 60 degrees zenithal angle shooting. From this study, we found that the lidar signal was extinguished very quickly and with maximum range of 3 kilometers for 30 seconds temporal resolution. The signal was extremely noisy in this study and even after subtracting the backgrounds such as solar radiation in the range corrected signal. Dead-time correction was then applied to improve the lidar signal. The better signal for the near and far ranges of this angle shooting, gluing both analog and photon is necessary. Temporal evolution was plotted to determine the planetary boundary layer (PBL) structure and the altitude of PBL also can be identified. Moreover, cloud distribution and aerosol concentration pattern can be structured from the temporal evolution graph. However, for identifying the tendency of PBL structure in Penang Island, longer period and continuous data acquisition were needed.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of PBL Schemes of ARW Model in Simulating Thermo-Dynamical Structure of Pre-Monsoon Convective Episodes over Kharagpur Using STORM Data Sets
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
AB  - In the present study, advanced research WRF (ARW) model is employed to simulate convective thunderstorm episodes over Kharagpur (22A degrees 30'N, 87A degrees 20'E) region of Gangetic West Bengal, India. High-resolution simulations are conducted using 1 x 1 degree NCEP final analysis meteorological fields for initial and boundary conditions for events. The performance of two non-local [Yonsei University (YSU), Asymmetric Convective Model version 2 (ACM2)] and two local turbulence kinetic energy closures [Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ), Bougeault-Lacarrere (BouLac)] are evaluated in simulating planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameters and thermodynamic structure of the atmosphere. The model-simulated parameters are validated with available in situ meteorological observations obtained from micro-meteorological tower as well has high-resolution DigiCORA radiosonde ascents during STORM-2007 field experiment at the study location and Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) imageries. It has been found that the PBL structure simulated with the TKE closures MYJ and BouLac are in better agreement with observations than the non-local closures. The model simulations with these schemes also captured the reflectivity, surface pressure patterns such as wake-low, meso-high, pre-squall low and the convective updrafts and downdrafts reasonably well. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons reveal that the MYJ followed by BouLac schemes better simulated various features of the thunderstorm events over Kharagpur region. The better performance of MYJ followed by BouLac is evident in the lesser mean bias, mean absolute error, root mean square error and good correlation coefficient for various surface meteorological variables as well as thermo-dynamical structure of the atmosphere relative to other PBL schemes. The better performance of the TKE closures may be attributed to their higher mixing efficiency, larger convective energy and better simulation of humidity promoting moist convection relative to non-local schemes.

TI  - Portfolio as a method for continuous assessment in an undergraduate health education programme
T2  - MEDICAL TEACHER
AB  - A portfolio assessment system has been introduced into a biomedical science programme to promote both continuous learning and deep approaches to learning. Attention has been focused on creating harmony between the assessment system and the PBL curriculum of the programme. Biomedicine and laboratory work are central in the curriculum. The portfolio included evidence of laboratory work, personal reflections and certificates from the PBL tutor. The portfolio was assessed on three occasions over 20 weeks. The grades were 'pass' or 'fail'. The tutor certificate appeared to be a crucial part of the portfolio since a 'fail' in this part usually led to an overall 'fail'. Both students and teachers were concerned about ensuring that enough factual knowledge, as measured by a traditional test, had been achieved. The agreement was good enough for the pass or fail level but some expected differences were found at the detailed level. The course, including the portfolio, was evaluated orally during weekly whole-group meetings and using a questionnaire at the end. The students felt comfortable with the portfolio system and preferred it to a traditional test. The teachers felt that they needed to develop their teacher-student discussion skills and to improve their feedback on the reflections. Peer assessment between students is proposed as a line of action to enhance the credibility of the crucial tutor certificate. The portfolio might be an efficient tool for the students to concentrate their efforts on the most central concepts of medical laboratory work. The model will be developed through further discussions and better consensus among faculty.

TI  - Performance evaluation of the WRF model in a tropical region: Wind speed analysis at different sites
T2  - ATMOSFERA
AB  - In this study, the performance of the mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is evalua-ted using combinations of three planetary boundary layers (PBL) (YSU, ACM2, and MYJ) and three land surface model (LSM) schemes (RUC, Noah and Noah-MP) in order to identify the optimal parameters for the determination of wind speed in a tropical region. The state of Bahia in Brazil is selected as the location for the case study and simulations are performed over a period of eight months between 2015 and 2016 (dry and rainy seasons). The results of the simulations are compared with observational data obtained from three towers equipped with anemometers at heights of 80, 100, 120 and 150 m, strategically placed at each site and evaluated with statistical indices: MB, RMSE, MAGE, IOA, R, Fac2 and standard deviation. Overestimation of wind speed is observed in the simulations, despite similarities between the simulated and observed wind directions. In addition, the accuracies of simulations corresponding to sites that are closer to the ocean are observed to be lower. The most accurate wind speed estimates are obtained corresponding to Mucuge, which is located farthest from the ocean. Finally, analysis of the results obtained from each tower accounting for periods with higher and lower precipitation reveals that the combination of the PBL-YSU scheme with the LSM-RUC scheme yields the best results.

TI  - Critical Thinking Across the Curriculum: A Vision
T2  - TOPOI-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PHILOSOPHY
AB  - This essay offers a comprehensive vision for a higher education program incorporating critical thinking across the curriculum (CTAC) at hypothetical Alpha College, employing a rigorous detailed conception of critical thinking called "The Alpha Conception of Critical Thinking". The program starts with a 1-year, required, freshman course, two-thirds of which focuses on a set of general critical thinking dispositions and abilities. The final third uses subject-matter issues to reinforce general critical thinking dispositions and abilities, teach samples of subject matter, and introduce subject-specific critical thinking. Subject-matter departmental and other units will make long-range plans for incorporating critical thinking in varying amounts in subject-matter courses, culminating in a written Senior Thesis/Project involving investigating, taking, and defending a position, which reinforce critical thinking abilities and dispositions and increase subject-matter knowledge. Teaching approaches used in the program are involving and based on the principle, "We learn what we use." Both summative and formative assessment are employed as appropriate. Coordination and support are extensive. Objections and concerns are discussed, and alternatives, including possible transitions, are considered. An extended review of research supports moving toward CTAC.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
CP  - 3rd Annual Community-Modeling-and-Analysis-System-Users Conference
AB  - A comprehensive model evaluation has been conducted for MM5-CMAQ for the period of 1-10 July 1999 of the Southern Oxidants Study episode with a coarse-grid horizontal spacing of 32-km and a nested fine-grid spacing of 8-km. Meteorological and chemical predictions from simulations with both grids are compared with observations from both routine monitoring networks (e.g., CASTNet, IMPROVE, and AIRS-AQS) and special studies (e.g., SOS99/SOS99NASH, SEARCH, and ARIES). In this Part I paper, five simulated meteorological variables (i.e., temperature, relative humidity (RH), wind speed, wind direction, and planetary boundary layer (PBL) height) are evaluated. While MM5 reproduces well the diurnal variations for temperature and RH, and the minimum temperatures at all sites, it tends to overpredict maximum temperatures and underpredict both maximum and minimum RHs on most days at most sites. MM5 predictions agree reasonably well for wind speeds but poorly for wind direction and the maximum mixing depths. The significant overpredictions in the PBL heights can be attributed to the positive biases of the maximum 2-m temperatures and to the Medium Range Forecast (MRF) model PBL scheme and the Oregon State University (OSU)Land Surface Model used in the MM5 simulations. For wind speed/direction and the U- and V-component of the wind speed, the normalized mean bias (NMB) and the normalized mean bias factor (NMBF) are the most robust statistical measures because of the dominance of the extremely small observed values in the normalization for those variables.

TI  - DILEMMS IN EVALUATIVE PRACTICES AND TRAINING NEEDS FOR TUTORS IN THE PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING (PBL) METHOD
T2  - COMUNICACOES
AB  - This article presents research results whose goal is identified and discuss professional dilemmas in the field of learning assessment and formative needs of teachers-tutors who work on the Problem Based Learning (PBL) method of the Computer Engineering course at a public university in the State of Bahia. In fact, the following guiding question subsidized the development of the investigative process: what professional dilemmas, in terms of assessment processes, and formative needs of teachers-tutors of a public university can be evidenced through the teaching case methods? We are supported theoretically in reflections of Shulman (2014); Mizukami (2004); Zabalza (1994); Cunha (2015), among others. Methodologically, it is characterized by being a descriptive-analytical study, with a qualitative approach. The data were collected through the application of a teaching case, whose analysis was based on assumptions of the technique of content analysis, involving the three stages signaled by Bardin (1977). The data indicate that the participants' formative needs are concentrated in the pedagogical dimension, thus showing weaknesses in of these professionals' knowledge base of teaching. Regarding to the dilemmas, the tutors' testimonies emphasized the complex conduct of evaluative practices with the students in the context of the tutorial sessions and the students' unethical posture in the evaluative practices, especially, self-evaluation. Based on these aspects, we point out the need to design a proposal for ongoing training for research subjects, aiming their professional development.

TI  - Performance evaluation of PBL and cumulus parameterization schemes of WRF ARW model in simulating severe thunderstorm events over Gadanki MST radar facility - Case study
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
AB  - In the present study, an attempt has been made to simulate three severe thunderstorm events that occurred over Gadanki (13.5 degrees N, 79.2 degrees E) region of the Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere (MST) Radar facility using Weather Research Forecasting (WRF ARW version 3.2) model. We examined the performance of five planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization schemes namely, the Yonsei University (YSU), Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ), Mellor-Yamada Nakanishi and Niino Level 2.5 PBL (MYNN2), and Medium-Range Forecast (MRF) and Asymmetric Convective Model version 2 (ACM2) and three cumulus parameterization schemes Kain-Fritisch (KF), Betts-Miller-Janjic (BMJ) and Grell-Devenyi ensemble scheme (GD) in simulating boundary layer parameters, thermodynamic structure and vertical velocity profiles on the days of the thunderstorm events. Triple nested domain having the inner-most domain of 3 km grid resolution over the study area is considered. The model simulated parameters are validated with the available in situ meteorological observations obtained from micro-meteorological tower, radiosonde, MST radar wind profiler and observed rainfall along with the surface fluxes at Gadanki. After validating the model simulations with the available PBL observations and the statistical assessment reveal that the MYJ scheme could be able to capture the characteristic variations of surface meteorological variables such as air temperature, relative humidity, wind component, vertical profiles of wind, relative humidity and equivalent potential temperature and surface layer fluxes during the study period. Cores of strong convective updrafts with a time lag and lead of one and half hour are better represented by the model with MYJ scheme with GD as seen in the vertical velocity profiles obtained from MST radar observations. The present study advocates that the MYJ-GD combination is suitable for the simulation of thunderstorm events over the study region. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - An examination of sensitivity of WRF/Chem predictions to physical parameterizations, horizontal grid spacing, and nesting options
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
AB  - An accurate representation of meteorological processes is important to the accurate predictions of meteorology and air quality. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF/Chem) is utilized to examine the sensitivity of air quality predictions to two planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes and three land-surface models (LSMs). Model simulations with different PBL schemes and LSMs are conducted over the Houston-Galveston area for a 5-day summer episode from the 2000 Texas Air Quality Study (TexAQS-2000). Sensitivity to horizontal grid spacing (12 vs. 4 km) and nesting methods (1- or 2-way) is also studied. Model predictions are evaluated with available surface and aircraft observations. Both meteorological and chemical predictions at the surface and aloft show stronger sensitivity to LSMs than to the PBL schemes. The model predictions also show a stronger sensitivity to horizontal grid spacing using 1-way nesting than 2-way nesting and to the nesting method at 4 km than 12 km. The benefits (or disbenefits) of using more complex meteorological schemes, finer horizontal grid spacing, and more sophisticated 2-way nesting may vary and must be evaluated for specific episodes. The results from this study also indicate a need to refine model treatments at a fine grid spacing and the current 2-way nesting method used in WRF/Chem for improvement of model performance.

TI  - A simple approach of applying blended learning to problem-based learning is feasible, accepted and does not affect evaluation and exam results-a just pre-pandemic randomised controlled mixed-method study
T2  - NAUNYN-SCHMIEDEBERGS ARCHIVES OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - We tested for feasibility, acceptance, and "non-inferiority" of small-group teaching applying blended learning (i.e., the integration of face-to-face and online instruction) to problem-based learning (bPbL) compared to conventional PbL (cPbL). In a just pre-pandemic, randomised controlled trial, 317 students attended either bPbL or cPbL groups. The first meeting of the bPbL groups took place online via written internet chat, while cPbL groups met on site. All groups met on site the second time. All students had the opportunity to attend lectures either on site or as videos on demand. We analysed student evaluation data, results in a final summative exam, attendance of lectures on site and use of lecture videos. Furthermore, we performed a qualitative analysis of student statements made in semi-structured group interviews about pros and cons of the bPbL approach. There was no difference between students of either bPbL or cPbL groups with respect to exam results (score: 14.3 +/- 2.8 vs. 13.8 +/- 2.7) or course evaluation. However, relatively more bPbL than cPbL students reported having used lecture videos, while the proportion of those attending lectures on-site was higher among cPbL students. Interviews revealed that some of the bPbL students' experiences were unexpected and feared disadvantages seemed to be less severe than expected. Participation in a blended PbL format did not worsen course evaluations or exam results, but seemed to influence lecture attendance. The combination of face-to-face and digital elements could be suitable as a hybrid approach to digital instruction in the post-pandemic era.

TI  - Evaluation of Different WRF Parametrizations over the Region of Iasi with Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
AB  - This article aims to present an evaluation of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with multiple instruments when applied to a humid continental region, in this case, the region around the city of Iasi, Romania. A series of output parameters are compared with observed data, obtained on-site, with a focus on the Planetary Boundary Layer Height (PBLH) and on PBLH-related parametrizations used by the WRF model. The impact of each different parametrization on physical quantities is highlighted during the two chosen measurement intervals, both of them in the warm season of 2016 and 2017, respectively. The instruments used to obtain real data to compare to the WRF simulations are: a lidar platform, a photometer, and ground-level (GL) meteorological instrumentation for the measurement of temperature, average wind speed, and pressure. Maps of PBLH and 2 m above ground-level (AGL) atmospheric temperature are also presented, compared to a topological and relief map of the inner nest of the WRF simulation. Finally, a comprehensive simulation performance evaluation of PBLH, temperature, wind speed, and pressure at the surface and total precipitable water vapor is performed.

TI  - Evaluation of a New Assessment Tool in Problem-Based Learning Tutorials in Dental Education
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION
AB  - The Harvard School of Dental Medicine (HSDM) uses a hybrid problem-based learning (PBL) approach to teaching in the D.M.D. curriculum. Each tutorial group at HSDM is made up of eight to ten students. The objective of this study was to examine the performance of the students in the tutorial sessions as assessed by the tutor. A total of ten tutorial blocks led by twenty-four tutorial leaders were completed at HSDM between summer 2008 and fall 2009. All of the tutors were calibrated to a new assessment system that was developed for student assessment in the tutorials. The students were assessed on three major domains: knowledge acquisition, problem-solving and analytical thinking skills, and personal and interpersonal development. The tutors evaluated the students assigned to their group after the end of each block. Students also filled out a self-assessment form. Simple descriptive statistics were used to summarize the evaluations of the tutors. A total of 290 student evaluations from ten tutorial blocks were available for analysis. Tutors reported that 64 percent of the students preferred to communicate verbally without prompting and 68 percent of students submitted written reports to the groups during tutorial sessions. Tutors reported that a majority of students brought new information to each tutorial session (86.5 percent), brought information that facilitated others' learning (88.7 percent), integrated newly acquired knowledge with previous knowledge (92.7 percent), applied knowledge from self-study to explain issues during case discussions (91.7 percent), asked appropriate questions to stimulate discussions (87.3 percent), generated hypotheses to explain problems under discussion (83.8 percent), evaluated the hypotheses in light of available evidence (85.5 percent), defined and took responsibility for learning goals and objectives (89.3 percent), responded well to criticism (91.7 percent), took a leadership role (74.5 percent), and demonstrated sensitivity to psychosocial issues (88.6 percent). Student communication that tended to take over the group process in a non-contributory manner was reported in only 2 percent of the evaluations. Overall, students participating in PBL tutorial sessions appear to exhibit problem-solving and analytical thinking skills and personal and interpersonal attributes.

TI  - BIOMIMICRY INNOVATION AS A TOOL FOR DESIGN
T2  - 2012 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE
CP  - ASEE Annual Conference
AB  - A modified form of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) was employed to apply the ideas of innovation and biomimicry to ergonomics problems. This Biomimicry Innovation Tool (BIT) begins with a focus on nature's laws as a starting point to design and allows students to uncover evidence that will enable the useful application of the laws of nature to solve a technical ergonomics design problem. The BIT blends aspects of problem based learning, innovation, biomimicry, and ergonomics into a single student experience.
   The prototype BIT was applied and assessed in an undergraduate ergonomics course. The program the students were in requires alternating twelve-week terms of academics and cooperative education employment. The students began by individually identifying an ergonomics concern at their co-op workplace and providing a one-page written description of the concern. The concern was then passed along to another student to innovate a nature-based solution to the concern. Using a step-by-step approach, students formed an idea that evolved into a solution. A grading rubric allowed the professor to fairly and objectively evaluate the final presentations. The prototype BIT will be modified based on student assessment data and experiences in the classroom.

TI  - Evaluation of different parameterization schemes in the WRF model for assessment of meteorological conditions over an industrial region in South-East India
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
AB  - The present study evaluates different physical parameterization schemes available in Weather Research and Forecasting model version 3.8 (WRF-ARW) over the Angul-Talcher region of Odisha state in India. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out for various schemes for planetary boundary layer, microphysics, and radiation in the WRF model, which have not been tested over this Indian region that often experiences extreme heat in summer (> 45 degrees C) as well as high air pollution. Performance evaluation is based on in situ observations of near-surface temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity during a representative case of peak summer conditions. It was inferred from analysis of several sets of simulations that the combination of GBM PBL scheme, Lin microphysics, and RRTMG radiation scheme performs better for near surface parameters such as temperature at 2 m (overall RMSE of 2.19 degrees C, in daytime and 2.06 degrees C in nighttime), relative humidity (RMSE: 20.65%), and wind in comparison to the rest of the combinations. Furthermore, the various schemes were also tested with observed vertical profile of wind speed, temperature, and heat fluxes, to arrive at the overall conclusions of this study.

TI  - WRF Physics Ensemble Performance Evaluation over Continental and Coastal Regions in Germany
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
AB  - WRF is used to simulate eight extreme precipitation events that occurred over the regions of Schleswig-Holstein and Baden-Wurttemberg in Germany. The events were chosen from the German Weather Service (DWD) catalog and exceeded the DWD's warning level 3 (i.e., rainfall > 40 mm/h). A two-way nesting approach is used with 9 and 3 km spatial resolutions. Initial and boundary conditions are obtained from the ERA5 dataset at 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees. To model each event, thirty different parameterization configurations were used, accounting for all possible combinations of five microphysics (MP), three cumulus (CU), and two planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization methods, yielding a total of 240 simulations. TOPSIS multicriteria analysis technique is employed to determine the performance skill of each setup and rank them, using six categorical and five statistical metrics. Resolution increase from 9 to 3 km did not improve forecasting accuracy temporally or in intensity. According to TOPSIS ranking, when treating each event individually, the ideal parameterizations combination is spatiotemporally dependent, with certain members ranking higher. When all events are considered, the Morrison double-moment MP-Grell-Freitas CU-YSU PBL combination works best with a frequency of occurrence in the top five performing scenarios of 30%, 47.5%, and 57.5% respectively.

TI  - Development of a List of Can-do Statements for Global Communication in Engineering and its Applications
T2  - 2017 7TH WORLD ENGINEERING EDUCATION FORUM (WEEF)
CP  - 7th World Engineering Education Forum (WEEF)
AB  - Global communication skills are essential so that engineers can function successfully in global settings. To properly evaluate the outcomes of global communication education for engineering students, we need a measurement tool that incorporates the global communication elements of engineers' professional practice. In this study, the authors developed a list of Can-do statements which measures foreign language communication competency in engineering settings. In the development, the authors adopted the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment (CEFR), and then used the English scores of more than 1800 working engineers and university students to validate the level separation of the Can-do list, which has ten competency levels (from CEFR A1 to C2 with sub-scales) for reception, production, and interaction activities in communication. With the Can-do list, we surveyed 100 personnel managers at Japanese global engineering companies and identified the minimum communication competency levels from engineers. This list has also been used to compare the communication competency of students who participated in global PBL programs with students from different countries. The analysis of the student assessment outcomes suggests that Japanese engineering students need more opportunities or training to enhance their self-evaluations of global communication competency.

TI  - PROBLEM BASED LEARNING IN ACIDS AND BASES: LEARNING ACHIEVEMENTS AND STUDENTS' BELIEFS
T2  - JOURNAL OF BALTIC SCIENCE EDUCATION
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of Problem Based Learning on high school students' understanding of ionization of water and acid and base strength. Students' beliefs about Problem Based Learning were also analysed. A quasi-experimental design was conducted in this study. While students in the experimental groups were instructed via Problem Based Learning, teacher-centred approach was used in the control groups. Before the instructions, a prerequisite knowledge test was applied to identify their prerequisite knowledge to learn the topics, and no significantly differences were found between experimental and control groups. After the instructions, a post-test was applied to determine their understanding of the topics. The results indicated that the mean scores of the students in the experimental groups were significantly higher than those in the control groups. Problem Based Learning Assessment Scale results reflected that students' positive beliefs increased after each activity. Based on these results, it can be concluded that PBL instruction is effective in concept learning in chemistry education.

TI  - Integration of Virtual Instrumentation in the Teaching of Data Acquisition and Interface Systems Course
T2  - IEEE REVISTA IBEROAMERICANA DE TECNOLOGIAS DEL APRENDIZAJE-IEEE RITA
AB  - This paper presents a case study of the integration of virtual instrumentation in the development of engineering projects in undergraduate electrical engineering education, regarding a Data Acquisition and Interface Systems (DAIS) course. The DAIS course is part of the undergraduate curriculum in electrical engineering degree of Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG). This course is very important in the training of students who will work in the area of electronics, and uses LabVIEW as an educational tool to carry out practical activities. In the semester course, the teacher and the monitor followed up the student teams that proposed engineering projects to be developed during four milestones of the DAIS course. Statistical analysis of the collected data is done by semester course and by academic year. For each milestone, LabVIEW tutoring sessions and educational assessment are performed with student teams, who had great facility in learning the tool. In the final presentation of engineering projects, the students demonstrated domain about the content of the DAIS course and they were fully satisfied with LabVIEW. From the results, the students considered the virtual instrumentation tool with 96% of usefulness during the academic year and 100% recommendation to be applied in other engineering projects.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of Planetary Boundary Layer Schemes in Simulating Structures of Wintertime Lower Troposphere in Seoul Using One-Hour Interval Radiosonde Observation
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - We investigated the structures of the wintertime lower troposphere in Seoul, South Korea on 17 and 18 January 2017 by performing 1 h interval radiosonde observation and numerical simulations. In the daytime on 17 January, the height of the convective boundary layer (CBL) sharply and quickly increased when the residual layer became a part of the CBL. From the afternoon on 17 January, moist air with clouds began to substantially intrude in the lower troposphere in Seoul, and radiative heating/cooling weakened. As a result, the mixing of air in the lower troposphere was inhibited and the vertical gradients of potential temperature and water vapor mixing ratio changed little on 18 January. We evaluated the performance of four planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization schemes (the Yonsei University (YSU), Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ), Mellor-Yamada-Nakanishi-Niino (MYNN), and Asymmetric Convective Model version 2 (ACM2) schemes) coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting model in simulating the structures of the lower troposphere against 1 h interval radiosonde observation. The general tendencies of the air temperature and wind speed in the lower troposphere were well-reproduced in the four simulations. However, the sharp increase in the CBL height did not appear in the four simulations, implying that the process of the residual layer becoming a part of the CBL in the daytime is not well-parameterized. Additionally, the simulated water vapor mixing ratio near the surface was smaller compared with the observation. We found that small-scale turbulence in the CBL, which mixes advected air and pre-existing air, was not reproduced well by the PBL parameterization schemes. Compared with the other simulations, the most accurate air temperature and wind speed were reproduced in the simulation with the MYJ scheme, while the CBL development and moisture advection were reproduced relatively well in the simulation with the MYNN scheme.

TI  - EVALUATION OF A LESSON RESOURCE FOR PROBLEM-BASED / BLENDED-LEARNING IN THE UNDERGRADUATE COURSE OF APPLIED ANIMAL BIOLOGY
T2  - ICERI2015: 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION
CP  - 8th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)
AB  - A learning-centred system, where the acquired knowledge must be understood by the students to apply it in real life, has two important aspects requiring improvement: (1) how the students evaluate their acquisition of problem-based learning (PBL), and (2) how teachers can lower time for assessing students' activities. To provide the activities with a formative assessment, students must be informed about their results with a good and fast feedback. It may be, however, too much effort for training assessments that usually are a small percentage of the final grade. To reconcile both above-mentioned aspects, we designed a PBL with the Moodle Lesson module. The aims of this study are: (1) to analyse the use of this tool in our teaching-learning process, validating the training capacity of the resource, (2) to evaluate the adequacy of the tool with the students' progress, (3) to assess the formative capacity of the tool on the training and skills achieved with its use, and (4) to minimize the effort of the teachers in the activity follow-up.
   We implemented a Lesson on a topic of Applied Animal Biology (6th semester of the Environmental Sciences Graduate Program). The group class was forty students working in pairs. The task was scheduled for two hours, and the lesson's tool included links to a guide, notes and related material (a video and a research paper) with ramifications linked to key questions that regulate navigation. Students can debate with their pairs, and their answers provide them with personalized feedback information on their skills. The use of the resource was analysed from the registry of the Moodle-virtual campus, and the students' opinions by a survey answered at the end of the sessions. This task represents 5% of the final grade, although two more lessons are planned for next year.
   The registry showed that students completed the task in 55 minutes (from 45 min, fast learners, to 70 min, slow learners). All pair groups obtained high grades (mean: 8.0 points of 10, range: 6.0 - 9.3) that correlate positively with the global average grade of the other 6 collaborative activities (r=0.76; N=40), but not with the final grade (r=0.23; N=40) which included laboratory sessions and a theoretical exam.
   The results of students' survey are very positive, with enthusiastic comments. Most (83%) would be willing to do more, and only 3% did not like to repeat the experience. Many students conform that the results on the Lesson to be a part of their final grade, and they agree that questions were adequately graded. Among the most positive aspects, they signalled it is a dynamic tool, entertaining, visual and didactic. Among the negative aspects: visual design is simple; there are some ambiguous questions; and, in some questions, choosing a bad option had not explicitly explained what is wrong.
   The teachers conclude that some ambiguous questions (from the students' point of view) can be easily rearranged for the future, and agree that knowing the right answers and the reasons of misconceptions should improve student self-learning process using a Lesson. All are satisfied with the results obtained by the students and think that this tool is very useful to assess in a fast manner the progress and knowledge acquisition. They highlighted the interaction that the Lesson promoted among students, and its effectiveness to inform students about how they solve real problems.

TI  - Performance evalu1ation of the WRF model under different physical schemes for air quality purposes in Buenos Aires, Argentina
T2  - ATMOSFERA
AB  - This work presents the performance evaluation of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to estimate surface wind speed and direction, air temperature, and water vapor mixing ratio considering 22 configurations at high spatial resolution (1 km) during one week in winter and one week in spring, in order to determine the best-performing schemes for air quality purposes in the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Ai-res, Argentina. Results show that the use of urban schemes mostly affects wind speed and temperature. The single-layer urban canopy model (UCM) coupled with the Boulac planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme exhibits the best results for wind speed. Wind direction and water vapor mixing ratio are more sensitive to the land surface model scheme, with results slightly improving with the Noah-MP land surface model. Wind speed and direction errors are larger when the former is lower. When removing from the analysis wind speed values below 2.6 m s-1 for the winter week and 3.1 m s-1 for the spring week, the root mean square errors for wind direction decreased between 50 and 72% of the original value, depending on the configuration and week. Overall, under the studied conditions, configurations including Noah-Mp land surface model or the combination of a simple UCM with BouLac PBL are suitable for air quality applications, as they reproduce both temperature and water vapor mixing ratio relatively well, with errors below 10% and Correlation values above 0.7, and are the best performing configurations for wind direction and speed, respectively.

TI  - Competence and training in interventional pulmonology
T2  - PANMINERVA MEDICA
AB  - I nterventional pulmonology (IP) is experiencing a rapid evolution of new technologies. There is a need to develop structured training programs, organized in high volume expert centers in order to improve trainee education, and including the development of validated metrics for their competency assessment. Concerning teaching methods, a gradual progression from theory to practice, using new teaching techniques, including live sessions and low and high-fidelity simulation, flipped classroom models and problem-based learning (PBL) exercises would provide a training setting more suitable for our current need to improve skills and update professionals. Training programs should be learner-centered and competence-oriented, as well as being based on a spiral-shaped approach in which the same subject is addressed many times, from new and different perspectives of knowledge, ability, behavior and attitude, until the trainee has demonstrated a high degree of skill and professionalism. Furthermore there is a need to standardize the training programs as guide for physicians wishing to undertake a gradual and voluntary improvement of their own competencies, and assist those planning and organizing training programs in IP. The article includes a general part on core curriculum contents, innovative training methods and simulation, and introduces the following articles on the skills that the Interventional Pulmonologist must master in order to perform the different procedures. This monography should be considered a starting point that will evolve over time and results in better training for practitioners and better care for our patients. The task of establishing a trainee's competence to practice independently as an Interventional Pulmonologist remains the responsibility of the IP fellowship program director and faculty, who validate logbooks and assess competence for each procedure. These standards need to be reviewed and approved by national and International Scientific Societies and Healthcare Institutions with the aim to improve, disseminate and incorporate them in healthcare programs.

TI  - An integrated process rate analysis of a regional fine particulate matter episode over Yangtze River Delta in 2010
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
AB  - A high PM2.5 pollution episode was detected in Shanghai in November 2010. The integrated process rate method, an advanced diagnostic tool, was applied to account for the contribution of different atmospheric processes during the high pollution episode in the Yangtze River Delta region (YRD). The PM2.5 process analysis indicates that the emission of fine particles is the dominant source of high surface PM2.5 concentrations in the major cities of the YRD like Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou, following horizontal transportation and aerosols. The PM2.5 concentration could be reduced due to vertical advection and diffusion from lower levels to the upper air. The aerosols process such as homogeneous nucleation and condensation producing PM2.5 occurs throughout the PBL layer in urban areas, causing vertical transport from upper levels down to the surface layer. The aerosols process is much more significant in a downwind rural and coastal site like Zhoushan than in the urban areas. The PM2.5 change initiated by both horizontal transport and vertical transport is much stronger at 40-2000 m height than in the surface layer, while the PM2.5 change caused by horizontal diffusion is very small. Dry deposition can significantly reduce concentration of the particulates in the surface level of the atmosphere, and wet deposition can remove the particles in the planetary boundary layer (PBL). The cloud processes can either increase PM2.5 due to the aqueous-phase oxidation of SO2 and NO2 or remove PM2.5 due to cloud scavenging. Solar radiation and humidity are more important to secondary pollution, and they are the significant external factors affecting the chemical reactions among sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia, volatile compounds and fine particles.

TI  - Modeling of poleward-moving tropical cyclones in the northern East China Sea: Intercomparison of WRF physical schemes
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
AB  - Reliable tropical cyclone (TC) modeling and forecasting requires appropriate selection of physical parameterization schemes. This study focusses on the poleward-moving TCs in the northern East China Sea. Numerical experiments are carried out to examine the sensitivity of modeled TC parameters to different combinations of microphysics (MP), planetary boundary layer (PBL), and cumulus convection (CC) schemes. Model performance is evaluated against observations from China Meteorological Administration best-track dataset, satellite retrieved wind fields, and land-based meteorological stations. A composite evaluation metric is introduced to enable crossvariable model assessment and quantify the relative performance of each scheme combination. Results indicate that while MP schemes have a moderate impact on TC's minimum sea level pressure and maximum wind speed, they evidently influence surface wind field reproduction. Model performance across the PBL schemes is generally comparable, except for the University of Washington boundary layer scheme, which demonstrates strong forecasting skill for maximum wind speed but introduces substantial discrepancies in TC track, minimum sea level pressure, and surface wind fields. Moreover, model performance is highly sensitive to the choice of CC scheme. The Tiedtke scheme consistently yields the highest performance score across all datasets, particularly effective in reducing wind field discrepancies. This study underscores the necessity of considering multiple TC parameters and addressing spatial discrepancies in model calibration and performance evaluation. The findings provide insights into optimizing physical scheme combinations for TC modeling in the northern East China Sea, with broader implications for improving extreme weather forecasting. However, their applicability to other regions and TC types remains uncertain. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the physical mechanisms driving scheme-related differences in model performance.

Nurse Education Today 28, 93-99] few studies focus on describing "triggers", the process involved in their development and their evaluation from students' perspective. It is clearly documented that well designed, open ended, real life and challenging "triggers" are key to the success of PBL implementation [Roberts, D., Ousey, K., 2004. Problem based learning: developing the triggers. Experiences from a first wave site. Nurse Education in Practice 4, 154-158, Gibson, I., 2005. Designing projects for learning.

Mac Labhrainn, I., Fallon, H., (Eds.), Handbook of Enquiry and Problem-based Learning: Irish Case Studies and International, Perspectives. AISHE Et CELT, NUI Galway. < www.nuigalway.ie/cett/pbtbook >]. This paper outlines the planning, implementation and evaluation of a "trigger" developed for a first year undergraduate nursing module. To meet specific module learning outcomes and to stimulate student inquiry through the Learning strategy of PBL, a bright and colourful cottage, was constructed. This tool. was then evaluated using focus group interviews. Students' perspectives centered round a core theme, 'finding a focus and taking control'. Four categories were identified illustrating students progress from 'initial confusion' to engaging with the 'trigger diversity' before confidently 'exploring their own line of inquiry', thus leading to the 'stimulation of their learning'. Consistent with previous research, we also suggest it is customary for students to experience an initial period of ambiguity as they switch from teacher led to student centered learning [Biley, F., 1999. Creating tension: under graduate students nurses' response to a problem-based learning curriculum. Nurse Education Today 19 (7), 586-589]. One challenge in developing "triggers" is that the process is primarily controlled by lecturers. We suggest that a possible way forward would be to also engage students in the development of "triggers". (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - DEVELOPING AN INTEGRATED ORGAN/SYSTEM CURRICULUM WITH COMMUNITY-ORIENTATION FOR A NEW MEDICAL COLLEGE IN JAZAN, SAUDI ARABIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND COMMUNITY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Jazan province is located in the south-west of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The province is offlicted with a wide spectrum of diseases and therefore have a special need for more health services. The Faculty of Medicine at Jazan has been following the traditional curriculum since its inception in 2001. The traditional curriculum has been criticized because of the students inability to relate what they learned in the basic sciences to medicine, thus stifling their motivation. It was felt that much of what was presented in preclinical courses was irrelevant to what the doctor really needed to know for his practice. The College therefore, decided to change to an integrated curriculum.
   Design: The study was conducted in 2004-2005 in the Faculty of Medicine, Jazan University. It began with a literature survey/search for relevant information and a series of meetings with experts from various institutions. A Curriculum Committee was formed and a set of guiding principles was prepared to help develop the new curriculum. A standard curriculum writing format was adopted for each module. It was decided that an independent evaluation of the new curriculum was to be done by experts in medical education before submission for official approval. There were several difficulties in the course of designing the curriculum, such as: provision of vertical integration, the lack of preparedness of faculty to teach an integrated curriculum, and difficulties inherent in setting a truly integrated examination.
   Curriculum: The program designed is for 6 years and in 3 phases; pre-med (year 1), organ/system (years 2 and 3), and clinical clerkship (years 4, 5, and 6). This is to be followed by a year of Internship. The pre-med phase aims at improving the students' English language and prepare them for the succeeding phases. The organ/system phase includes the integrated systems and the introductory modules. The curriculum includes elective modules, early clinical training, behavioral sciences, medical ethics, biostatistics, computer practice, and research methods. The curriculum provides active methods of instruction that include: small group discussion/tutorials, problem-based learning (PBL), case-study/clinical presentations, seminars, skills practice (clinical skill lab), practical, demonstration, and student independent learning. Methods of evaluating students include continuous and summative assessment.
   Conclusion: The new curriculum adopted by the Jazan Faculty of Medicine is an integrated, organ/ system based, community-oriented, with early clinical skills, elective modules, and innovative methods of instructions.

TI  - DISSEMINATION STRATEGY IN THE FRAMEWORK OF TEMPUS PROJECT: "ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SUPRA-REGIONAL NETWORK OF THE NATIONAL CENTRES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION, FOCUSED ON PBL AND VIRTUAL PATIENTS"
T2  - INTED2014: 8TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE
CP  - 8th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)
AB  - The term "dissemination" has become a familiar part of vocabulary within higher education and it is easy, therefore, to talk about doing it without having a real grasp of what it means. Some authors mentioned, that perhaps the term dissemination can be best described as the "delivering and receiving of a message", "the engagement of an individual in a process" and "the transfer of a process or product". If you think about dissemination or what it is you are trying to achieve by doing it - it is quite probable that you have been awarded funding for an educational development project (as in our case EU granted "Establishment of the Supra-Regional Network of the National Centers in Medical Education, focused on PBL (Problem-Based Learning) and Virtual Patients") that requires you to disseminate the outcomes of your project to the wider community and society in general. TEMPUS overall objectives, as well as specific objectives, maybe even goals/mission/philosophy all are based on it.
   In our case we have considered dividing this issue into two parts:
   1. Dissemination at national level with the main objective to promote the most recent and important achievement in medical education which is Virtual Patient based teaching/learning/assessment.
   2. Providing the input into the creation of an area of cooperation in the field of higher education between the European Union and the TEMPUS partner countries.
   In addition to the above - "popularization" is a broad term and it assumes that interested parties will "know", "understand", "acquire methodology", "implement in practice", "communicate internationally regarding the issue", "execute and perform scientific research in medical education" etc. Consequently, in order to plan and perform processes efficiently, it was necessary to clarify the terms like "audience", "components of dissemination", as well as identifying stages and means of efficient realization.
   The working group achieved contextual understanding of abovementioned terms, developed definitions, defined target groups, objectives and methods related to them, as well as defined criteria reviewing progress and meeting the objectives (questionnaires).
   An efficient dissemination strategy will only continue to be effective if we view it as being an evolving and constantly developing process. This means, that we need to put in place suitable mechanisms for reviewing the progress and the extent to which our dissemination strategy in meeting our objectives.

TI  - Pilot virtual patient application in Greek medical education
T2  - ARCHIVES OF HELLENIC MEDICINE
AB  - OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was the design and implementation of a virtual patient (VP) system, according to the latest technological standards for electronic simulation, and to pilot its use in Greek electronic medical education. METHOD Two software programs, which were complementary to each other, were exploited, namely, VUE and OpenLabyrinth. Their application is based on standards proposed by MedBiquitous, an international organization that coordinates the use of free and open standards in medical education. The VP scenario is based on the strategy of problem based learning (PBL), and stems from a case of cardiological origin. RESULTS The scenario was developed to allow learners to collaborate with a virtual patient through multiple contacts, in order to conduct various different examinations and to investigate different approaches in order to reach treatment decisions. The realistic VP content was further enhanced by the incorporation of multimedia material, thereby simulating real healthcare conditions and targeting the acquisition of clinical skills. The educational activity using VP was completed by the assessment of each learner's performance, achieved by a scoring system, and the provision of feedback. CONCLUSIONS The implementation of the VP system provides users with the opportunity to practice diagnosis and decision making in a setting free of risk for the patient and the healthcare environment. This system can simplify the administrative effort associated with education and learning assessment. Although clinical experience with real patients remains a vital part of medical education, e-learning with virtual patients offers the means of extending this experience and compensating for practical deficiencies.

TI  - Do medical students' scores using different assessment instruments predict their scores in clinical reasoning using a computer-based simulation?
T2  - ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
AB  - Purpose: The development of clinical problem-solving skills evolves over time and requires structured training and background knowledge. Computer-based case simulations (CCS) have been used for teaching and assessment of clinical reasoning skills. However, previous studies examining the psychometric properties of CCS as an assessment tool have been controversial. Furthermore, studies reporting the integration of CCS into problem-based medical curricula have been limited.
   Methods: This study examined the psychometric properties of using CCS software (DxR Clinician) for assessment of medical students (n=130) studying in a problem-based, integrated multisystem module (Unit IX) during the academic year 2011-2012. Internal consistency reliability of CCS scores was calculated using Cronbach's alpha statistics. The relationships between students' scores in CCS components (clinical reasoning, diagnostic performance, and patient management) and their scores in other examination tools at the end of the unit including multiple-choice questions, short-answer questions, objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), and real patient encounters were analyzed using stepwise hierarchical linear regression.
   Results: Internal consistency reliability of CCS scores was high (alpha=0.862). Inter-item correlations between students' scores in different CCS components and their scores in CCS and other test items were statistically significant. Regression analysis indicated that OSCE scores predicted 32.7% and 35.1% of the variance in clinical reasoning and patient management scores, respectively (P < 0.01). Multiple-choice question scores, however, predicted only 15.4% of the variance in diagnostic performance scores (P < 0.01), while students' scores in real patient encounters did not predict any of the CCS scores.
   Conclusion: Students' scores in OSCE are the most important predictors of their scores in clinical reasoning and patient management using CCS. However, real patient encounter assessment does not appear to test a construct similar to what is tested in CCS.

TI  - Using a photochemical model to assess the horizontal, vertical and time distribution of PM2.5 in a complex area: Relationships between the regional and local sources and the meteorological conditions
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - A photochemical transport model has been implemented to assess the PM2.5 spatial and temporal distribution in Venice-Mestre. This is a large city of the eastern Po Valley, which is recognized having among the highest levels of many air pollutants in Europe. This study is a first attempt to evaluate PM2.5 distribution in such a complex ecosystem strongly affected by several different environments (the adjacent Alps, the lagoon and the sea) that create a spatial discontinuity of climate. Model performance was tested with experimental results. Samples have been collected in three sites representative of different emission characteristics. A second simulation was performed with clean boundary conditions to check the influence of the background concentrations on the study domain. Local and regional contributions were found to be strongly dependent on seasonal conditions and on local meteorology. A further analysis was conducted to predict the PM2.5 distribution with respect to air mass movements. The non-homogeneity of surfaces affects the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) behavior. This consequently influences the vertical distribution of PM2.5 especially during cold seasons and on occasion of particular meteorological events. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Role of isoprene in secondary organic aerosol formation on a regional scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
AB  - The role of isoprene as a source of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is studied using laboratory-derived SOA yields and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency regional-scale Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system over a domain comprising the contiguous United States, southern Canada, and northern Mexico. Isoprene is predicted to be a significant source of biogenic SOA, leading to increases up to 3.8 mu g m(-3) in the planetary boundary layer (PBL, defined as 0-2.85 km) and 0.44 mu g m(-3) in the free troposphere over that in the absence of isoprene. While the addition of isoprene to the class of SOA-forming organics in CMAQ increases appreciably predicted fine-particle organic carbon (OC2.5) in the eastern and southeastern U. S., total OC2.5 is still underpredicted in these regions. SOA formation is highly sensitive to the value of the enthalpy of vaporization of the SOA. The role of isoprene SOA is examined in a sensitivity study at values of 42 and 156 kJ mol(-1); both are commonly used in 3-D aerosol models. Prediction of ambient levels of SOA in atmospheric models remains a challenging problem because of the importance of emissions inventories for SOA-forming organics, representation of gas phase atmospheric chemistry leading to semivolatile products, and treatment of the physics and chemistry of aerosol formation and removal.

TI  - A performance evaluation of the National Air Quality Forecast Capability for the summer of 2007
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
AB  - This paper provides a performance evaluation of the real-time, CONUS-scale National Air Quality Forecast Capability (NAQFC) that supported, in part, its transition into operational status. This evaluation focuses primarily on discrete forecasts for the maximum 8-h O-3 concentrations covering the 4-month period, June through September, 2007, using measurements obtained from EPA's AIRNow network. Results indicate that the 2007 NAQFC performed as well or better than previous configurations, despite the expansion of the forecast domain into the western half of the nation that is dominated by complex terrain. The mean, domain-wide, season-long correlation was 0.70. When examined over time, the domain-wide correlations exhibit a fairly consistent nature, with values exceeding 0.60 (0.70) over 90% (55%) of the days. The NAQFC systematically over-predicted the 8-h O-3 concentrations, continuing a trend established by earlier NAQFC configurations, though to a lesser degree. The summer-long mean forecast value of 53.2 ppb was 4.2 ppb higher than the observed value, resulting in a domain-wide Normalized Mean Bias (NMB) of 8.7%. Most of the over-prediction is associated with observed concentrations less than 50 ppb. In fact the model tends to under-predict when concentrations exceed 70 ppb. As with the bias, the error associated with the latest configuration was also lower. The summer-long Root Mean Square Error of 13.0 ppb (Normalized Mean Error (NME) = 20.4%) represented marked improvements over earlier forecasts. Examination of the spatial distribution of both the NMB and NME reveals that the NAQFC was generally within 25% for the NME and 25% for the NMB over a majority of the domain. Several areas of poorer performance, where the NMB and NME often exceed 25% and in some cases 50%, were noted. These areas include southern California, where the NAQFC tended to under-predict concentrations (especially on weekends) and the southeast Atlantic and Gulf coasts regions, where the model over-predicted. Subsequent analysis revealed that the incorrect temporal allocation of precursor emissions was likely the source of the under-prediction in southern California, while inaccurate simulation of PBL heights likely contributed to the over-prediction in the coastal regions.

TI  - Videoconferencing of a National Program for Residents on Evidence-Based Practice: Early Performance Evaluation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the medium of videoconferencing for the delivery of a course for radiology residents in practice-based learning (PBL), including evidence-based practice, at centers geographically separated from the principal teaching site.
   Materials and Methods: Twenty-one participants (second-year radiology residents) at 8 centers in a radiology training program were included. The course in PBL was delivered over 16 weekly 1-hour sessions. There were 8 local education site coordinators (staff radiologists), who had completed an intensive 1-day course at the principal teaching site. The host site was linked to the participant sites using videoconferencing technology. Course evaluation included 1) a 5-point Likert-type scale and an open-ended evaluation questionnaire midway through the course (week 8) and a summation questionnaire after its completion (week 16) and 2) a consultation forum held during the penultimate session. The data responses to the questionnaires were entered in a spreadsheet, and the data were analyzed. Qualitative data were manually coded and analyzed for common themes. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed.
   Results: Eighty-five percent of evaluation questionnaires and 53% of summation questionnaires were returned. The overall satisfaction of the participants with course content was high, with median rating of 4 on the 5-point scale. All participants agreed that videoconferencing as a medium did not hinder adequate discussion among centers and worked well as an interactive teaching method (median, 4). Local coordinators were satisfied with local technical support and training (median, 4), and overall, the module was rated highly, with ratings of 4 from both residents and local coordinators. Seventy-one percent of residents and 86% of local coordinators reported that they would have been unable to participate in the course without videoconferencing. All participants completed the course requirements satisfactorily. The overall rating of audio quality was good (median, 4), but there was dissatisfaction with the quality of the visual aids used. Comments reflected a desire for a shorter, more condensed course; improvement of the quality of visual aids; and more emphasis on research appraisal.
   Conclusion: Although videoconferencing is a valuable educational tool and works well as a didactic teaching method, challenges with interactive discussion between centers require further exploration. This technology allows the inclusion of trainers and trainees who may otherwise be unable to participate. In multicenter programs, this can be fundamental to the feasibility and sustainability of educational programs in newer competencies, for which a lack of a critical mass of educators and students can be problematic for individual centers.

TI  - A comprehensive performance evaluation of MM5-CMAQ for the Summer 1999 Southern Oxidants Study episode- Part II: Gas and aerosol predictions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
CP  - 3rd Annual Community-Modeling-and-Analysis-System-Users Conference
AB  - Gas and aerosol predictions from CMAQ simulations with horizontal grid spacings of 8- and 32-km are evaluated against available observations from CASTNet, IMPROVE, AIRS-AQS, SOS99/SOS99NASH, SEARCH, and ARIES for the southeastern US for the period of 1-10 July 1999. The predictions evaluated in this work include mixing ratios Of O-3 (hourly, maximum 1-h, and 8-h average), NOx, HNO3, NOy, and mass concentrations Of PM10, PM2.5, and PM2.5 components.
   Our evaluation has shown that CMAQ tends to underpredict maximum 1-h O-3 mixing ratios on high O-3 days at some sites. It overpredicts the maximum and minimum hourly O-3 mixing ratios for most low O-3 days, the daytime and nighttime hourly, and the maximum 8-h average O-3 mixing ratios on most days at all sites. The model performance for hourly O-3 mixing ratios generally meets EPA's criteria but deteriorates for maximum 1- and 8-h average O-3 mixing ratios. CMAQ underpredicts the mass concentrations Of PM10, PM2.5, and PM2.5 composition and fails to reproduce their temporal variations (except for sulfate). Largest underpredictions occur for organic matter (OM2.5) and nitrate(2.5) among all PM components. These underpredictions and overpredictions may be caused by inaccurate meteorological predictions (e.g., the PBL height, wind speed/direction, vertical mixing, temperature, and relative humidity) and boundary conditions for chemical species (e.g., O-3), underestimation in emissions (e.g., NOx, NH3, and primary OM), as well as uncertainties in model assumptions and treatments in aerosol chemistry and microphysics.

TI  - Communication skills scores of medical students and interview performance 3years later
T2  - HEALTH EDUCATION JOURNAL
AB  - Objective: Communication skills are important, but the evaluation of these skills in the medical curriculum remains inconsistent. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the communication skills scores of junior medical students following curricula with different module evaluations and the clinical interview performance of the same students in a psychiatry department in their fifth year.
   Design: Prospective evaluation of communication and clinical interview skills.
   Setting: Medical school and psychiatry department inpatient setting.
   Method: The communication skills scores of 208 medical students in their second year (between 2009 and 2011) and their performance in interviews with patients in a psychiatry department in their fifth year (between 2012 and 2014) were assessed. Initial assessment was undertaken on the basis of problem-based learning (PBL) performance, evaluation of performance during conversation with patients, a related oral presentation and written report, students' self-rating and a peer rating. Extra marks were given if students completed an optional special report inspired by the curriculum. To assess the interview performance of fifth-year medical students, the mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercise (mini-CEX) was used, together with weekly case-based discussions and the observation of a clinical interview with a real patient.
   Results: Tutors' evaluations of the junior medical students' performance during role-play (=.22, p=.001), its related reciprocal assessment (=.18, p=.010) and an extra-effort task (=.18, p=.009) as part of the communication skills curriculum were significantly correlated with the students' later performance in a clinical interview with a patient.
   Conclusion: Observation of student interactions and motivations along with reciprocal peer evaluations offer better measures of communication skills in medical education than are oral presentations, self-ratings and conversations with real patients.

TI  - Subgrid-scale aerosol-cloud interaction in the atmospheric chemistry model CMA_Meso5.1/CUACE and its impacts on mesoscale meteorology prediction
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB  - Aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI) significantly influences global and regional weather and is a critical focus in numerical weather prediction (NWP), but subgrid-scale ACI effects are often overlooked. Here, a subgrid-scale ACI mechanism is implemented by explicitly treating cloud microphysics in the KFeta convective scheme with real-time size-resolved hygroscopic aerosol activation and introducing subgrid-scale cloud radiation feedback in an atmospheric chemistry model, CMA_Meso5.1/CUACE. With a focus on summer over central and eastern China, the performance evaluation shows that this developed model with subgrid-scale cloud microphysics and radiation feedback refines cloud representation, even in some grid-scale unsaturated areas, and subsequently leads to attenuated surface downward shortwave radiation (similar to 18.5 W m-2) that is more realistic. The increased cloud radiative forcing results in lower temperature (similar to 0.35 degrees C) and higher relative humidity (similar to 2.5 %) at 2 m, with regional mean bias (MB) decreasing by similar to 40 % and similar to 18.1 %. Temperature vertical structure and relative humidity below similar to 900 hPa are improved accordingly due to cooling and humidifying. The underestimated precipitation is enhanced, especially at the grid scale, thus reducing regional MB by similar to 34.4 % (similar to 1.1 mm). The performance differences between various subregions are related to convective conditions and model local errors. Additionally, compared to simulations with anthropogenic emissions turned off, subgrid-scale actual aerosol inhibits cumulative precipitation during a typical heavy rainfall event by similar to 4.6 mm, aligning it with observations, associated with lower autoconversion at the subgrid scale and less available water vapor for grid-scale condensation, suggesting competition between subgrid- and grid-scale cloud. This study contributes to the understanding of the impact of subgrid-scale ACI on NWP.

TI  - If you could change three things in your school, which would they be? 1,393 student proposals from six Greek medical schools
T2  - ARCHIVES OF HELLENIC MEDICINE
AB  - OBJECTIVE The ability of students to learn is affected, positively or negatively, by the quality of the educational environment (EE) of their school. The DREEM (Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure) questionnaire, a valid international non culturally specific generic instrument for measuring students' perceptions of undergraduate curricula in the health professions, has been translated into Greek and validated. The validation study and the preliminary results from the 50 closed questions have been reported elsewhere. The objective of this paper was to present the students' responses to the open question "if you could change three things in your school, which would they be?". METHOD The data were derived from 592 DREEM questionnaires completed by students from 6 of the 7 Greek medical schools, representative for gender (41% male, 59% female) but not for year of study or school (first and second years 10%, third year 70%, fourth year and above 20%; Athens 2%, Crete 7%, Ioannina 35%, Thessaloniki 21%, Thessaly 19%, Thrace 16%). The students' written text was analyzed, employing methods of qualitative data analysis. During repeated interactive sessions between the researchers, the students' proposals were grouped into categories and subcategories according to their conceptual content, and their frequency was calculated. RESULTS The changes which were proposed by the students numbered 1,393. They were related mainly to curriculum (552) and teachers (547), and much less to other elements (294). Students asked for increased practical experience (156), restructured and lightened timetable (87), cut-back of irrelevant subjects (67) and subject content (22); changes in the way of teaching (213) and of student assessment (172), and in teachers' attitudes (90) and the selection of teachers (37). Specifically, students asked for smaller teaching groups (22), encouragement of student participation (21), emphasis on the important and relevant (24), fair assessment (40), memorization reduction (19), student-teacher communication (37), and meritocracy in teachers' appointment (28). Students did not request changes among themselves, except a few who wanted restriction of the student political parties (15). No mention at all was made of their teachers' research activity, asylum, "eternal" students, or student participation in governing bodies, and only one of textbooks. Certain proposals, although made only once, were notable (e.g., teaching in systems, change to PBL, etc.). CONCLUSIONS Medical students ask for a well organized curriculum and for their teachers to play the teaching-role, rather than the issues emphasized in the media (academic asylum, etc.) or by the faculty bodies (research). This may explain why they become stressed, bored in lessons, and parrot-like in their exams. Their wishes, if heeded, could also serve to re-orientate the disorientated student movement to become the major axis of the debate on the universities in Greece.

TI  - A novel downscaling technique for the linkage of global and regional air quality modeling
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB  - Recently, downscaling global atmospheric model outputs (GCTM) for the USEPA Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Initial (IC) and Boundary Conditions (BC) have become practical because of the rapid growth of computational technologies that allow global simulations to be completed within a reasonable time. The traditional method of generating IC/BC by profile data has lost its advocates due to the weakness of the limited horizontal and vertical variations found on the gridded boundary layers. Theoretically, high quality GCTM IC/BC should yield a better result in CMAQ. Unfortunately, several researchers have found that the outputs from GCTM IC/BC are not necessarily better than profile IC/BC due to the excessive transport of O-3 aloft in GCTM IC/BC. In this paper, we intend to investigate the effects of using profile IC/BC and global atmospheric model data. In addition, we are suggesting a novel approach to resolve the existing issue in downscaling.
   In the study, we utilized the GEOS-Chem model outputs to generate time-varied and layer-varied IC/BC for year 2002 with the implementation of tropopause determining algorithm in the downscaling process (i.e., based on chemical (O-3) tropopause definition). The comparison between the implemented tropopause approach and the profile IC/BC approach is performed to demonstrate improvement of considering tropopause. It is observed that without using tropopause information in the downscaling process, unrealistic O-3 concentrations are created at the upper layers of IC/BC. This phenomenon has caused over-prediction of surface O-3 in CMAQ. In addition, the amount of over-prediction is greatly affected by temperature and latitudinal location of the study domain. With the implementation of the algorithm, we have successfully resolved the incompatibility issues in the vertical layer structure between global and regional chemistry models to yield better surface O-3 predictions than profile IC/BC for both summer and winter conditions. At the same time, it improved the vertical O-3 distribution of CMAQ outputs. It is strongly recommended that the tropopause information should be incorporated into any two-way coupled global and regional models, where the tropospheric regional model is used, to solve the vertical incompatibility that exists between global and regional models.

TI  - E-ASSESSMENT WITH MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS: A 5 YEAR STUDY OF STUDENTS' OPINIONS AND EXPERIENCE
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-INNOVATIONS IN PRACTICE
AB  - Aim/Purpose The aim of this study is to understand student's opinions and perceptions about e-assessment when the assessment process was changed from the traditional computer assisted method to a multiple-choice Moodle based method.
   Background In order to implement continuous assessment to a large number of students, several shifts are necessary, which implies as many different tests as the number of shifts required. Consequently, it is difficult to ensure homogeneity through the different tests and a huge amount of grading time is needed. These problems related to the traditional assessment based on computer assisted tests, lead to a redesign of the assessment resulting in the use of multiple-choice Moodle tests.
   Methodology A longitudinal, concurrent, mixed method study was implemented over a five-year period. A survey was developed and carried out by 815 undergraduate students who experienced the electronic multiple-choice questions (eMCQ) assessment in the courses of the IS department. Qualitative analyses included open-ended survey responses and interviews with repeating students in the first year.
   Contribution This study provides a reflection tool on how to incorporate frequent moments of assessment in courses with a high number of students without overloading teachers with a huge workload. The research analysed the efficiency of assessing non-theoretical topics using eMCQ, while ensuring the homogeneity of assessment tests, which needs to be complemented with other assessment methods in order to assure that students develop and acquire the expected skills and competencies.
   Findings The students involved in the study appreciate the online multiple-choice quiz assessment method and perceive it as fair but have a contradictory opinion regarding the preference of the assessment method, throughout the years. These changes in perception may be related to the improvement of the question bank and categorisation of questions according to difficulty level, which lead to the nullification of the 'luck factor'. Other major findings are that although the online multiple-choice quizzes are used with success in the assessment of theoretical topics, the same is not in evidence regarding practical topics. Therefore, this assessment needs to be complemented with other methods in order to achieve the expected learning outcomes.
   Recommendations for Practitioners In order to be able to evaluate the same expected learning outcomes in practical topics, particularly in technology and information systems subjects, the evaluator should complement the online multiple-choice quiz assessment with other approaches, such as a PBL method, homework assignments, and/or other tasks performed during the semester.
   Recommendations for Researchers This study explores e-assessment with online multiple-choice quizzes in higher education. It provides a survey that can be applied in other institutions that are also using online multiple-choice quizzes to assess non-theorical topics. In order to better understand the students' opinions on the development of skills and competencies with online multiple-choice quizzes and on the other hand with classical computer assisted assessment, it would be necessary to add questions concerning these aspects. It would then be interesting to compare the findings of this study with the results from other institutions.
   Impact on Society The increasing number of students in higher education has led to a raised use of e-assessment activities, since it can provide a fast and efficient manner to assess a high number of students. Therefore, this research provides meaningful insight of the stakeholders' perceptions of online multiple-choice quizzes about practical topics.
   Future Research An interesting study, in the future, would be to obtain the opinions of a particular set of students on two tests, one of the tests using online multiple-choice quizzes and the other through a classical computer assisted assessment method. A natural extension of the present study is a comparative analysis regarding the grades obtained by students who performed one or another type of assessment (online multiple-choice quizzes vs. classical computer assisted assessment).

   We have discovered that the previously published paper was not the latest version of the manuscript we intended to use. Some corrections made during the second ACPD reviewing process were not incorporated in the text. As a result, the figure numbers (i.e., figure number below the graph) were not referenced correctly in the manuscript. Therefore, we have decided to re-publish this paper as a corrigendum.
