Author Guidelines
Thank you for considering submitting a paper to JSEP.  
 
Once you submit a paper we will have a peer review of it completed as quickly as possible.  We will provide you with our decision concerning publishing it along with feedback from the reviewers. 

If approved we ask authors to pay a small publishing fee of $30 USD.  This fee can be paid through PayPal which accepts credit cards and other payment options.  We will also provide you with the copyright transfer form.
 
JSEP only accepts articles written in English.

In order to have a consistent look to JSEP we ask that you follow the simple style guide and instructions below.

Use the most recent APA format with the following exceptions:
Do not have a separate title page.  Put the title and author information at the top of the first page.
Do not include a table of content.
Do not put page breaks between sections.
Single space the paper.
Do not include a header or footer.  They will be added later.
