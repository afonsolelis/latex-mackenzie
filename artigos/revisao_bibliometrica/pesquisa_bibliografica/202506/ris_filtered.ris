AB  - The concept of the intelligent Digital Twin focuses on automatic model creation and model extension for a product throughout its lifecycle using artificial intelligence. To create an intelligent Digital Twin, the Digital Twin architecture must also include software services that support machine learning algorithms. These software services must have two characteristics. First, an interface to the real environment to dynamically receive feedback from an existing product or a product under development. Second, machine learning algorithms that analyze and manage the Digital Twin's models based on feedback from the real product. In this paper, we present the concept and implementation of a software service within the intelligent Digital Twin's architecture for automated requirements modeling as well as for modeling of the product system architecture. Since medical devices differ significantly in their applied technology, area of use, and application, the requirement engineering of medical devices needs to identify and specify the critical design requirements for each product individually. This makes automated requirement engineering and Model-based-Systems Engineering of medical devices very challenging. The implemented intelligent software service meets these challenges for product design in the healthcare sector. Copyright (C) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - In Industry 4.0, the innovative concept of a smart warehouse is defined as a progressive development in logistics and operations management. Numerous advanced techniques are recommended for integration, including wearable devices, communication, loading/unloading, optimization, robotics, and automated transportation, among others. Currently, the growing demand for swift cargo distribution, cost-effective labour utilization, and enhanced productivity stands as an urgent topic for both enterprises and scholars. This paper presents an EtherCAT-based model of automated guided vehicle (AGV)-manipulation introduced within the Unity platform for smart warehouse management. The working environment selected for this model is a cross-docking warehouse with a chessboard layout. Initially, theoretical computations pertaining to mechanical design are established to provide accurate parameters. Subsequently, the structure of the TwinCAT Human-Machine Interface Server and the configuration within the Unity environment are outlined. Following that, the software architecture, encompassing data exchange and a set of motion commands, is meticulously explained. To validate the proposed approach, several laboratory tests are conducted under identical conditions. This research offers several contributions: firstly, it introduces the innovative use of real-time technology to represent AGV systems; secondly, it elucidates the potential connection between virtual reality and the physical model; and thirdly, it employs fluid motion techniques to illustrate and visualize driving performance. These findings hold significant promise not only for the advancement of smart warehouse management but also for the broader landscape of digital trade.These works present the emerging technologies (motion control, digital twin, autonomous vehicle) into smart mobility platform. Owing to our development, several applications in warehouse management could be reached such as online training, virtual-reality interaction, supervision and monitoring, driven control.image

TI  - Digital twin-assisted intelligent anomaly detection system for Internet of Things
PY  - 2024
VL  - 158
DO  - 10.1016/j.adhoc.2024.103484
AB  - The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices within the cyber-physical infrastructure has raised privacy and security concerns. This is because processing large amounts of data and extracting anomalous data cannot be imprecisely identified with the limited storage and processing capabilities of IoT devices. Against this backdrop, edge computing is a networking paradigm to reshape the next generation of IoT-based applications, which brings computation and data storage closer to the data sources. However, since edge servers are difficult to obtain security protections like in centralized data centers, this makes them more vulnerable to security attacks. To address this issue, we propose a novel digital twin system architecture in edge computing -based Internet of Things (IoT) networks, which allows efficient data processing for anomaly detection at the network edge. Digital twin is a replica of the real world in a virtual environment with continuous information exchange. Our digital twin -assisted solution gives a data -driven strategy against the cell outage and simulates the behavior and patterns of the physical assets in the digital world. Powered by data processing capabilities at the network edge, the proposed digital twin -assisted model can help extract features and behaviors, reduce noise from data generated in the network physical model, and filter out redundant data for a better characterization of the network physical model in the anomaly detection service. To this extent, the contributions in this paper are threefold: We first propose a novel digital twin -assisted anomaly detection framework that processes highdimensional data efficiently and improves the system performance despite the imbalanced classes. Second, we define an autoencoder-based threshold algorithm and evaluate the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier to implement self -learning capability into the digital twin for an accurate prediction. Third, we extract the features, dependencies, and relationships to apply the learned model to the new and unseen dataset for real-time monitoring and optimization and evaluate the performance of the proposed model with both real-time and historical data. Finally, we analyze the performance of different classifiers to validate our model. We use four different datasets and demonstrate that our solution outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy performance, AUC score, and ROC curve.

TI  - Real-Time Analysis of Multiple Root Causes for Anomalies Assisted by Digital Twin in NFV Environment
PY  - 2022

AB  - Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a promising paradigm that enables the employment of novel service types with lower deployment cost and faster time-to-value, but it introduces new fault management problems and challenges. In NFV environment, anomalies occurred in virtual machines (VMs) can be caused by faulty components of their hosting servers or anomaly propagation from other ones. If the performance of VMs degrades, we need to find out the root causes accurately, i.e., locate the exact faulty components, to recover the networks as soon as possible. In this paper, we first use digital twin to establish a virtual instance of the physical network to capture the real-time anomaly-fault dependency relationship. When the network environment changes, transfer learning is leveraged to utilize the learned knowledge of dependency relationship in historical periods to avoid huge time and computation cost of learning from scratch. Assisted by the learned dependency relationship, a dynamic set-covering (DSC) based root caused analysis problem is formulated and modeled with a set of parallel hidden Markov models to capture the dynamics of component states, which can best explain the sequence of anomalous VMs. We use alternating direction method of multipliers to decompose the DSC problem into a set of independent sub-problems and solve it in a distributed fashion. Since the state variables of each component in the DSC problem are coupled between any two successive time epochs, each sub-problem is solved by the Viterbi decoding and an incremental function is designed to construct the feasible solution that covers all anomalous VMs. Simulation results show the availability and superiority of the digital-twin assisted root cause analysis algorithm for NFV environment.

AB  - Quality and efficiency of the work environment are essential to the well-being, health and productivity of employees. Despite the increasing focus on these aspects, many workplaces currently do not fully meet the needs and expectations of employees, with negative consequences for their well-being and productivity. The research aims to develop a system based on the Smart Building and Digital Twin paradigm, focusing on the implementation of various IoT components, the creation of automation flows for energy-efficient lighting, HVAC and indoor air quality control systems, and decision support through real-time data visualization enabled by user interfaces and dashboards integrating the geometric and information model (BIM). The system also aims to provide a tool for both monitoring and simulation/planning/decision support through the processing and development of machine learning (ML) algorithms. In relation to emergency management, real-time data can be acquired, allowing information to be shared with users and building managers through the creation of dashboards and visual analysis. After defining the functional requirements and identifying all3 the monitorable quantities that can be translated into requirements, the system architecture is described, the implementation of the case study is illustrated and the preliminary results of the first data collection campaign and initial estimates of future forecasts are shown.

AB  - In augmented reality (AR) applications, the real world can interact with the virtual world through image processing and overlay. This concept is increasingly being utilized in various Industry 4.0 applications, such as mobile robotics, the Internet of Things, computer vision, and more. This article presents the development of an augmented reality (AR)-based digital twin system with a focus on its educational significance. The developed system enables simulation, interaction, and real-time visualization of the trajectory of an autonomous mobile robot, using sensor fusion with the Kalman filter. By integrating AR with the robot's odometry, the system enhances the accuracy of robot localization, providing an immersive and interactive learning experience. Leveraging AR software development kits like Unity and Vuforia facilitated the creation of a modular application that can be used in conjunction with a mobile robot. The effectiveness of the developed system is demonstrated by delivering enhanced reliability and precision in estimating the robot's trajectory, thereby contributing to a better understanding of autonomous locomotion principles. Furthermore, the article discusses the educational applications and ongoing improvements of the platform, exploring the potential of augmented reality as a powerful educational tool in the context of mobile robotics.

TI  - The Metaverse Is Geospatial: A System Model Architecture Integrating Spatial Computing, Digital Twins, and Virtual Worlds
PY  - 2025

DO  - 10.3390/ijgi14030126
AB  - Virtual geographic environments long simulated real-world scenarios in urban planning, monument preservation, city infrastructure management, education, and entertainment. Their web-based visualisation and distribution made these environments widely accessible. However, many systems remain static, lacking real-time data integration and multi-user collaboration, while virtual worlds designed for the Metaverse emphasise dynamic interaction yet often omit essential geospatial context. Bridging this gap is critical for advancing virtual geographic environments into the next generation. In this paper, we present a modular system architecture for applications demonstrating geospatial virtual worlds over the web. Our goal is to provide a generic, well-structured framework that exposes the essential classes and interfaces needed for building 3D virtual worlds with geospatial data at their core. Our work focuses on defining specific geospatial components, methods, classes, and interfaces that form the foundation of a modern geospatial virtual environment in the Metaverse era. The proposed architecture is organised into three layers: access, world, and integration, which together enable accurate mapping and integration of real-time sensor data, digital twin synchronisation, and support for location-based services. Our analysis reveals that while most current solutions excel in either multi-user interaction or geospatial data management, they rarely combine both. In contrast, our model delivers enhanced geospatial focus, real-time collaboration, and interoperability between physical and digital realms. Overall, this work lays a solid foundation for future innovations in creating immersive, interactive, and geospatially grounded virtual experiences over the web, marking an important step in the evolution of virtual geographic environments for the Metaverse era.

TI  - Predictive maintenance using digital twins: A systematic literature review
PY  - 2022
VL  - 151
DO  - 10.1016/j.infsof.2022.107008
AB  - Context: Predictive maintenance is a technique for creating a more sustainable, safe, and profitable industry. One of the key challenges for creating predictive maintenance systems is the lack of failure data, as the machine is frequently repaired before failure. Digital Twins provide a real-time representation of the physical machine and generate data, such as asset degradation, which the predictive maintenance algorithm can use. Since 2018, scientific literature on the utilization of Digital Twins for predictive maintenance has accelerated, indicating the need for a thorough review.Objective: This research aims to gather and synthesize the studies that focus on predictive maintenance using Digital Twins to pave the way for further research.Method: A systematic literature review (SLR) using an active learning tool is conducted on published primary studies on predictive maintenance using Digital Twins, in which 42 primary studies have been analyzed.Results: This SLR identifies several aspects of predictive maintenance using Digital Twins, including the objectives, application domains, Digital Twin platforms, Digital Twin representation types, approaches, abstraction levels, design patterns, communication protocols, twinning parameters, and challenges and solution directions. These results contribute to a Software Engineering approach for developing predictive maintenance using Digital Twins in academics and the industry.Conclusion: This study is the first SLR in predictive maintenance using Digital Twins. We answer key questions for designing a successful predictive maintenance model leveraging Digital Twins. We found that to this day, computational burden, data variety, and complexity of models, assets, or components are the key challenges in designing these models.

TI  - Developing a Digital Twin at Building and City Levels: Case Study of West Cambridge Campus
PY  - 2020
VL  - 36
IS  - 3
DO  - 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000763
AB  - A digital twin (DT) refers to a digital replica of physical assets, processes, and systems. DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to create living digital simulation models that are able to learn and update from multiple sources as well as represent and predict the current and future conditions of physical counterparts. However, current activities related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets from an architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase, which is the longest time span in the asset life cycle. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT would be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of buildings and cities. According to current research about multitier architectures, this paper presents a system architecture for DTs that is specifically designed at both the building and city levels. Based on this architecture, a DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge in the UK was developed that integrates heterogeneous data sources, supports effective data querying and analysis, supports decision-making processes in O&M management, and further bridges the gap between human relationships with buildings/cities. This paper aims at going through the whole process of developing DTs in building and city levels from the technical perspective and sharing lessons learned and challenges involved in developing DTs in real practices. Through developing this DT demonstrator, the results provide a clear roadmap and present particular DT research efforts for asset management practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to promote the implementation and development of DT at the building and city levels.

TI  - A Digital Twin Platform for Multi-Rotor UAV
PY  - 2021
SP  - 7909
EP  - 7913
AB  - A digital twin platform framework for multi-rotor UAV is proposed in this paper. The platform is composed of simulation system, physical UAV and service center, which is designed to solve the problem about UAV advanced capability training and algorithm verification. As we know, a good UAV system verification method is to make full use of virtual simulation before repeated physical tests. However, there is a gap between the virtual simulation and physical test results, because the simulation model is difficult to completely describe the actual physical object. So the hidden risks may exist in actual physical tests by only using the results of virtual simulations. Based on the feedback control idea, the actual state data of the physical UAV is fed back to virtual simulation platform, and the virtual simulation platform completes virtual and real joint training and verification based on this. That is, the technology of digital twin is introduced into the UAV system development process in this paper. In addition, the digital twin platform structure of two-way interaction between virtual space, physical space and service center is proposed. The 4G/5G communication interface is developed to improve the platform's real-time interaction capabilities. Besides, the components of the platform and the construction process are introduced in detail. Finally, three platform test experiments are used to verify the interactive characteristics of the platform and introduce the operating process of the platform.

TI  - Digital Twins for the built environment: learning from conceptual and process models in manufacturing
PY  - 2021
VL  - 49
DO  - 10.1016/j.aei.2021.101332
AB  - The overall aim of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm in the built environment by drawing inspiration from existing DT research in manufacturing. The DT is a Product Life Management information construct that has migrated to the built environment while research on the subject has grown intensely in recent years. Common to early research phases, DT research in the built environment has developed organically, setting the basis for mature definitions and robust research frameworks. As DT research in manufacturing is the most developed, this paper seeks to advance the understanding of DTs in the built environment by analysing how the DT systems reported in manufacturing literature are structured and how they function. Firstly, this paper presents a thorough review and a comparison of DT, cyber-physical systems (CPS), and building information modelling (BIM). Then, the results of the review and categorisation of DT structural and functional descriptions are presented. Fifty-four academic publications and industry reports were reviewed, and their structural and functional descriptions were analysed in detail. Three types of structural models (i.e. conceptual models, system architectures, and data models) and three types of functional models (process and communication models) were identified. DT maturity models were reviewed as well. From the reviewed descriptions, four categories of DT conceptual models (prototypical, model-based, interface-oriented, and servicebased) and six categories of DT process models (DT creation, DT synchronisation, asset monitoring, prognosis and simulation, optimal operations, and optimised design) were defined and its applicability to the AECO assessed. While model-based and service-based models are the most applicable to the built environment, amendments are still required. Prognosis and simulation process models are the most widely applicable for AECO use-cases. The main contribution to knowledge of this study is that it compiles the DT's structural and functional descriptions used in manufacturing and it provides the basis to develop DT conceptual and process models specific to requirements of the built environment sectors.

AB  - The digital twin paradigm is a promising enabling technology to accelerate the decarbonisation of industrial sites that use process heat. With digital representations that look-like, behave-like, and connect to a physical system, digital twins bring together critical operational and asset data into a single knowledge store. However, a high-fidelity digital twin relying on the cloud in real-time with direct influence on operations exposes the plant to cyber attacks. We propose a software architecture for a Digital Twin that adaptively generates more accurate representations of its operations to detect malicious activities and mitigate their effects. To achieve this adaptivity, our solution leverages ML, time-series forecasting, concept drift detection and control stability analysis. To evaluate our solution, we develop a simulation of a simple industrial plant consisting of one PID-controlled steam-boiler and a variety of uncertainties. Our experimental evaluation suggests that Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control, a system identification technique, best contributes towards Self-Learning by producing verifiable models that better align the need for retraining with concept drifts.

AB  - 6th generation (6G) cellular networks are expected to enable various safety-critical use cases, for example, in the industrial domain, which require flawless operation of the network. Thus, resilience is one of the key requirements for 6G. A particularly critical point is that 6G, as any other wireless technology, is based on the open radio medium, making it susceptible to interference. Especially intentional interference, that is, jamming, can severely degrade the network operability. Therefore, a new approach for detecting anomalies in the radio spectrum using a digital twin (DT) of the radio environment is presented in this work. This allows the integration of contextual awareness in the anomaly detection process and is thereby superior to state-of-the-art methods for spectrum anomaly detection. We propose a suitable system architecture and discuss the tasks of machine learning (ML) therein, particularly for reducing the computational complexity, and to detect anomalies in an unsupervised manner. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by ray tracing simulations. The results indicate a strong detection capability in case of an accurate DT and thereby illustrate the potential of DTs to enhance monitoring of wireless networks in the future.

TI  - Adaptive digital twins for energy-intensive industries and their local communities
PY  - 2024
VL  - 10
DO  - 10.1016/j.dche.2024.100139
AB  - Digital Twins (DTs) are high-fidelity virtual models that behave-like, look-like and connect-to a physical system. In this work, the physical systems are operations and processes from energy-intensive industrial plants and their local communities. The creation of DTs demands expertise not just in engineering, but also in computer science, data science, and artificial intelligence. Here, we introduce the Adaptive Digital Twins (ADT) concept, anchored in five attributes inspired by the self-adaptive systems field from software engineering. These attributes are selflearning, self-optimizing, self-evolving, self-monitoring, and self-protection. This new approach merges cuttingedge computing with pragmatic engineering needs. ADTs can enhance decision-making in both the design phase and real-time operation of industrial facilities and allow for versatile 'what-if' scenario simulations. Seven applications within the energy-intensive industries are described where ADTs could be transformative.

TI  - DIGITALIZATION OF A ROBOT-BASED DIRECTED ENERGY DEPOSITION PROCESS FOR IN-SITU MONITORING AND POST-PROCESS DATA ANALYTICS
PY  - 2024
AB  - To enhance quality and productivity as well as reduce trial and error in directed energy deposition (DED) processes, data analytics are essential. Collecting different signals like melt pool images, melt pool temperatures, environment conditions, and robot data during production, enables insights into the process. In general, the collected data can be either used during the process for in-situ monitoring or for post-process analytics anytime after the print job. Hence, in order to generate a digital twin of the process, the software architecture has to cover both cases, real-time data processing as well as data storage and access for post-process analysis. For this purpose, a software architecture consisting of four different layers, namely the physical-, distribution-, storage- and application layer was developed. The physical layer takes care of the sensor integration in the process and the real-time connection between the sensors and the data collection device. This device hosts at the same time the developed in-situ monitoring software ("DED Process Monitor"). The distribution layer is the connection layer between the physical- and storage layers by organizing the data transfer between the sensors and the database used by potential applications. The storage layer is embodied by a time-series database. A web- based software tool ("DED Process Analyzer"), representing the application layer, makes the database accessible for multiple users on different devices e.g. computers, notebooks, tablets, and smartphones. Through this architecture, a robot-based directed energy deposition process was digitalized including in-situ monitoring as well as postprocess data analytics. The DED Process Monitor is useable for the operator through a human-machine interface at the robot cell to observe the current production. This supports him in reacting to process deviations by adjusting process parameters or early stopping the process. In contrast to the DED Process Monitor, the DED Process Analyzer is realized through a decentralized web-based software tool. Therefore, the tool is useable for every employee with a suitable device connected to the internal network. Thereby multiple data engineers can use the collected data simultaneously for their analysis. Hereby different data analytic options are available. The scope starts from simple 2D data visualizations and ends up in post-process robot path simulations as well as complex 3D-Geomapping of sensor data. Through the 3D-Geomapping process sensor values are considered together with robot position data. This increases the extractable information content enormously. This method allows a geometrical representation of the sensor data over the contour of the printed part. By mapping sensor data to specific positions given by the robot, the sensor values are mapped to geometrical areas in the printed part. Thereby critical areas in the part can be identified. Using this information, later quality tests can focus on these areas instead of the total part. This saves time and costs. Furthermore, the DED Process Analyzer can be used to easily perform data preprocessing tasks like filtering and cleaning to create data sets which can then be used to train machine learning models.

TI  - Development of a Student-Centric Cyber-Physical System (SCPS): An Android App for Interactive Learning of Structural Analysis and Dynamics
PY  - 2022
SP  - 334
EP  - 341
AB  - Although there have been many attempts to increase student engagement and interaction in class through virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR), structural engineering has remained as one of the disciplines that lacks interactive learning. There was an earlier attempt by the authors to improve student learning in structural analysis and dynamics through a student-centric cyber-physical system (SCPS) that reacts to student movement and outcomes structural behavior. This system used mobile devices as sensors and sent data to be processed by a server. As a result, it suffered from the inherent limitation of Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)-lags and instability. Therefore, this paper presents the development of a new SCPS tool with a new system architecture that is much more stable and provide better user experience. This SCPS captures and uses student movement (i.e., walking, turning, and jumping) as point loads on a virtual bridge. As students move around, structural behavior (i.e., deflection) is simulated and visualized in real time.

TI  - Agent-based Simulation Model for Identifying Failure on Students' Project
PY  - 2017
SP  - 3113
EP  - 3118
AB  - In learning and development, students need to be made aware of their slips and mistakes in terms of acquiring the required knowledge, skills and competencies, especially, in active learning approaches. However, assessments may not necessarily lead to an effective understanding of student's errors. Most assessors are required to measure the extent of student's accurate output in terms of exam answers or practical assessments. Areas of failure tend to be overlooked and for this reason, learners at-risk of achieving poor results can become careless when completing assessments. In the present study, we examine the following research questions: (i) How can we simulate the landscape of data on both individual and team behaviour in terms of failure in their projects? (ii) How can we develop ways of identifying at-risk students in each team and support them immediately? Therefore, in order to address this problem, this research proposes an agent-based simulation of student projects, which considers both individual and team errors. This model is created on the basis of particular characteristics of individual learners within the team. We assume that individuals working within a team are subject to recognition-primed decision making when confronted with particular problems to solve. The adjustment proposed by this model includes analysing the problem using prior knowledge and planning as well as judgements on the suitability of particular solutions. This research will be further developed to identify at-risk learners in terms of investigating the areas they want to develop to achieve their learning goals in particular subjects and especially in the software development fields.

AB  - Digital twins employs simulation in conjunction with virtual environments and a variety of data coming from different plant equipment and physical systems to continuously update the digital models of the world in a feedback loop scheme to facilitate the decision-making processes. The heterogeneity of existing hardware and software requires the development of software architectures able to deal with the information exchange due to the integration and interaction of several system components and autonomous decision-making systems. In this work we propose the design and construction of a software architecture that integrates a manufacturing process simulator with the well-known robot operating system (ROS-Robot Operating System) to easily interchange information with an autonomous decision-making system. The proposal is tested with the simulator Tecnomatix and the free distribution ROS Melodic. We present an instance of software architecture for a typical complex case study of manufacturing plants and demonstrate its easy integration with an autonomous decision-making system based on the reinforcement- learning paradigm.

TI  - Collaborative Research: Software Engineering Workforce Development in High Performance Computing for Digital Twins
PY  - 2019
AB  - This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated engineers and technicians in production engineering.  It will do so by supporting two, two-day workshops on production engineering education by the University of Tennessee Chattanooga and Tennessee Technological University.   The overall goal of the workshops is to recommend educational approaches for the rapidly expanding production technology of digital twin research and development.  A digital twin is a virtual model of a process, product, or service. This pairing of virtual and physical worlds enables analysis and improvement of systems, including production engineering systems.  For example, by developing new efficiencies first in the digital twin, and then testing them in the physical twin, processes and products can be improved.  It is expected that these workshops will contribute to achieving scalable, reliable, and cost-effective strategies for creation of digital twins that accurately represent complex systems, such as manufacturing and chemical plants, airplanes, and wind turbines.  The workshops will also contribute to developing  guidelines for training the STEM workforce needed to develop and implement digital twins in production engineering and other applications.  The first workshop will be held at the University of Tennessee Chattanooga and will result in a report describing the intellectual contributions of multiple disciplines to the use of digital twins in production engineering. The second workshop, to be  held at Tennessee Technological University four months later, will result in a report describing curriculum recommendations for digital twin production engineering education.These workshops will convene thought leaders in high-performance computing, software engineering, uncertainty quantification, control system, digital twin modeling and simulation, and engineering education to develop recommendations for effective, innovative, distributed education related to digital twins, particularly in production engineering. In addition, they are expected to lead to convergent research projects at the intersection of  educational research and the multidisciplinary areas needed to design, implement, and  operate digital twins.  At the workshops, these disciplines will come together to establish conceptual models for education that will prepare workers to design digital twins that better integrate with production engineering environments. Collaborations are expected to emerge between educators and domain experts, yielding outcomes such as the enhanced design of high-performance simulation and machine learning software systems that are both responsive to evolving needs of  production environments and suitable for use in classroom and virtual environments.This project is funded by NSF's EHR Core Research: Production Engineering Education and Research (ECR: PEER) program, which seeks to improve the education of future and current professionals in production engineering. It also aims to study the effectiveness of the innovative educational strategies adopted by these projects.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

AB  - Digital twin (DT) is at the forefront of the Industry 4.0 revolution facilitated through advanced data analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity. With this research, we intend to explore the applications of DTs in the consumer electronics (CE) industry. This study delves into different realms within the consumer electronics sector to explore how DT technology could be beneficial while considering the potential limitations. Some CE fields that could benefit from DTs include product design and development, predictive maintenance, personalization, virtual user manuals and training, product performance optimization, remote support and troubleshooting, supply chain optimization, and sustainability. This research also focuses on various aspects of the crucial role played by consumer electronics in implementing DTs in the industry, including hardware integration, data collection methods and establishing reliable connectivity, software development, standards and interoperability, user experience and interaction design, data security and privacy, and feedback-driven improvements. It also discusses challenges like data accuracy, complexity, cost, limited scope of representation, data privacy and security concerns, user engagement and adoption, and integration and compatibility issues faced while implementing this technology.

AB  - With the rapid development of information economy, how to make full use of the existing store information for decision-making and analysis of goods has significant importance in the store's sales forecast. As a potential way to realize the interaction and integration between physical world and information space, the concept of digital twins had been proposed recently which attracted high attentions of academics practitioners in related fields. Based on the previous research on the concept of digital twins, the reference system architecture of digital twins convenience stores is designed. A digital twins model based on BP neural network is proposed as the example of convenience store prediction, compared with the traditional grey prediction, the results show that the model has smaller prediction error and higher accuracy.

PY  - 2024

IS  - 7
DO  - 10.3390/s24072115
AB  - Structural health monitoring (SHM) is critical for ensuring the safety of infrastructure such as bridges. This article presents a digital twin solution for the SHM of railway bridges using low-cost wireless accelerometers and machine learning (ML). The system architecture combines on-premises edge computing and cloud analytics to enable efficient real-time monitoring and complete storage of relevant time-history datasets. After train crossings, the accelerometers stream raw vibration data, which are processed in the frequency domain and analyzed using machine learning to detect anomalies that indicate potential structural issues. The digital twin approach is demonstrated on an in-service railway bridge for which vibration data were collected over two years under normal operating conditions. By learning allowable ranges for vibration patterns, the digital twin model identifies abnormal spectral peaks that indicate potential changes in structural integrity. The long-term pilot proves that this affordable SHM system can provide automated and real-time warnings of bridge damage and also supports the use of in-house-designed sensors with lower cost and edge computing capabilities such as those used in the demonstration. The successful on-premises-cloud hybrid implementation provides a cost effective and scalable model for expanding monitoring to thousands of railway bridges, democratizing SHM to improve safety by avoiding catastrophic failures.

AB  - Mobile artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) refers to the adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) algorithms deployed at mobile edge networks to automate the information creation process while fulfilling the requirements of end users. Mobile AIGC has recently attracted phenomenal attentions and can be a key enabling technology for an emerging application, called human digital twin (HDT). HDT empowered by the mobile AIGC is expected to revolutionize the personalized healthcare by generating rare disease data, modeling highfidelity digital twin, building versatile testbeds, and providing 24/7 customized medical services. To promote the development of this new breed of paradigm, in this article, we propose a system architecture of mobile AIGC-driven HDT and highlight the corresponding design requirements and challenges. Moreover, we illustrate two use cases, i.e., mobile AIGC-driven HDT in customized surgery planning and personalized medication. In addition, we conduct an experimental study to prove the effectiveness of the proposed mobile AIGC-driven HDT solution, which shows a particular application in a virtual physical therapy teaching platform. Finally, we conclude this article by briefly discussing several open issues and future directions.

AB  - Aiming at the problems of low motion efficiency of the robotic arm in the space full of obstacles and the inability to monitor the operation status in real time, this paper firstly designs the digital twin system architecture to realize the virtual reality mapping and interaction. Secondly, considering the requirement of robotic arm path planning, a digital twin-based APF-SAC path planning method is proposed, which optimizes the path generated by the artificial potential field method as the reference path and incorporates it into the reward function to accelerate the convergence speed of the traditional SAC algorithm, and introduces the recent experience playback technology to improve the stability and speed of training. Experiments based on the proposed algorithm show that the path imitation mechanism can improve the training efficiency, and the APF-SAC algorithm can plan the path more reasonably compared with the PPO algorithm. On this basis, the digital twin system is used to realize the real-time preview of the algorithm, which ensures the availability of the path and the safety of the robotic arm.

AB  - Technology enabled learning and communication are at the crossroads, which need flexible solutions. Flexible learning enables a learner to move seamlessly between the real and virtual world. We propose a novel flexible communication tool, "the smart book" to address these challenges. First, we review the role of the traditional book, its role in society today and the recent advances in augmented reality books. Next, we present a novel approach that integrates digital twins and mixed realities that is useful in communication, learning and for making decisions. We propose an initial vision of the architecture. Finally, we follow the Spiral of Creative Thought to create a first prototype with promising results. Our plan to further develop the architecture is to integrate this spiral with other software development methods. We need further iterations within the spiral to include final users and diverse applications.

TI  - Digital Twin-Enabled Online Battlefield Learning with Random Finite Sets
PY  - 2021

DO  - 10.1155/2021/5582241
AB  - The digital twin is becoming the most promising emerging technology in the field of unmanned combat and has the potential to innovate future combat styles. Online battlefield learning is one of the key technologies for supporting the successful application of digital twin in unmanned combat. Since there is an urgent need for effective algorithms for online learning the battlefield states in real time, a new random finite set- (RFS-) based algorithm is proposed in the presence of detection uncertainty including clutters, missed detection, and noises. The system architecture and operational mode for implementing the digital twin-enabled online battlefield learning are provided. The unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) is employed as the experimental subject for systematically describing the proposed algorithm. The system architecture for implementing the digital twin-enabled online battlefield learning is firstly given, and its operational mode is also described in detail. The RFS-based digital twin models including the battlefield state model, UGV motion model, and sensor model are designed. The Bayesian inference is adopted, and the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter is modified to implement the online learning process. At last, a group of experiments are conducted to verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The research work in this paper will provide a good demonstration of the application of digital twin in unmanned combat.

AB  - The widespread deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices across various smart city applications presents significant security challenges, increased by the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats. Traditional security solutions, including those using Federated Learning with federated averaging, suffer from inefficiencies due to random node selection and partial data sampling, which can hinder the detection of comprehensive networkwide attacks. This paper introduces a novel Cyberthreat Detection System for IoT networks that leverages Digital Twin technology and an optimized Federated Learning approach. Our hypothesis implies integrating Digital Twin models within an IoT security framework to improve real-time cyberthreat detection capabilities. We implement a 'Adaptive Thresholding with Early Stopping method' based methodology in Federated Learning to systematically train and aggregate local models based on predefined training rounds, thereby ensuring that all local models contribute to the global model until a target accuracy is achieved. This method significantly improves the detection of zero-day attacks by reducing dependency on random selections and partial data. The system architecture features Digital Twins of IoT medical infrastructure components-such as radiology, intensive care, and outpatient care-positioned at the network edge to minimize latency and bandwidth usage. Comparative evaluations of our model against traditional federated averaging methods demonstrate superior performance, with enhancements in model aggregation efficiency evidenced by higher F1 scores and reduced CPU usage. Specifically, our distributed digital twin environment at the edge layer shows 14% and 33% latency reductions compared to fog and cloud-based implementations, respectively. This study highlights the potential of Digital Twin and advanced Federated Learning methodologies to secure IoT networks against evolving and growing cyber threats.

PY  - 2024

DO  - 10.3390/app14188107
AB  - This research focuses on enhancing the preventive maintenance strategies currently employed for induction motors within ship propulsion systems, advocating for a shift towards a predictive maintenance model. It introduces a real-time monitoring framework that continuously observes the induction motor, providing essential support to maintenance personnel. The motor operates under a range of environmental and operational conditions, including temperature fluctuations, rotational speeds, and mechanical loads. These variations can obscure the current time series data, potentially masking signs of actual damage and hindering effective damage detection. To tackle this issue, the proposed framework utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) technology, specifically the well-established autoencoder, in conjunction with the Mahalanobis statistical distance. This approach accounts for the diverse operating conditions during the training phase, allowing it to model complex, non-linear relationships and effectively differentiate between normal and anomalous states. The framework is integrated into a decision support platform designed for real-time operations in maritime settings, offering a sophisticated system architecture that aims to align advanced damage detection methodologies with the maritime industry's need for real-time, user-friendly solutions.

PY  - 2025

DO  - 10.3390/app15105278
AB  - This study introduces a novel framework with the use of extended reality (XR) systems in hydrology, particularly focusing on immersive visualization of hydrologic data for enhanced environmental planning and decision making. The study details the shift from traditional 2D data visualization methods in hydrology to more advanced XR technologies, including virtual and augmented reality. Unlike static 2D maps or charts that require cross-referencing disparate data sources, this system consolidates real-time, multivariate datasets, such as streamflow, precipitation, and terrain, into a single interactive, spatially contextualized 3D environment. Immersive information systems facilitate dynamic interaction with real-time hydrological and meteorological datasets for various stakeholders and use cases, and pave the way for metaverse and digital twin systems. This system, accessible via web browsers and XR devices, allows users to navigate a 3D representation of the continental United States. The paper addresses the current limitations in hydrological visualization, methodology, and system architecture while discussing the challenges, limitations, and future directions to extend its applicability to a wider range of environmental management and disaster response scenarios. Future application potential includes climate resilience planning, immersive disaster preparedness training, and public education, where stakeholders can explore scenario-based outcomes within a virtual space to support real-time or anticipatory decision making.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel telemanipulation system that enables a human operator to control a dual-arm robot. The operation provides kinesthetic teaching via a digital twin of the robot which the operator cyber-physically guides to perform a task. Its key enabler is the concept of a virtual reality interactive marker, which serves as a simplified end effector of the digital twin robot. In virtual reality, the operator can interact with the marker using bare hands, which are sensed by the Leap Motion on top of a virtual reality headset. Then, the status (e.g. position/orientation) of the marker is transformed to the corresponding joint space command to the remote robot so that its end effector can follow the marker. We provide the details of the system architecture, and implement the system based on commercial robots/devices (i.e. UR5, Robotiq gripper, Leap Motion), virtual reality, ROS, and Unity3D. Moreover, the paper discusses the technical challenges that we had to address, and the system's potential benefits from a human-robot interaction perspective.

AB  - To accurately and effectively analyze electroencephalogram (EEG) with high complexity, large amount of data, and strong uncertainty, brain-computer interface (BCI) cognitive computing and its signal analysis algorithms are studied based on the digital twins (DTs) cognitive computing platform. To avoid the influence of noise on EEG analysis results, it is necessary to use filtering and defalsification methods to process EEG. Four methods, including Butterworth filter, finite impulse response (FIR) filter, elliptic filter, and wavelet decomposition, are summarized. Based on the Riemann manifold theory, a feature extraction algorithm under transfer learning based on tangent space selection (TL-TSS) is proposed. In the process of decoding EEG, an EEG decoding method combining entropy measure and singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is proposed. An algorithm performance is tested on the motor imagery dataset of the two International BCI Competitions. It is found that when the training sample size accounts for 5%, the TL-TSS algorithm proposed in this work is superior to other algorithms in classification accuracy. In particular, compared with common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm, it has great advantages. The classification accuracy of A2, A4, A8, and A9 users is the best, and especially for A8 users, the classification accuracy reaches 97.88%. In summary, in the EEG interface technology of DT cognitive computing platform, the combination of cognitive computing and deep learning can improve the recognition and analysis effect of EEG, which is of great value for further optimization of DT cognitive computing system.

TI  - An Open-source Hardware/Software Architecture and Supporting Simulation Environment to Perform Human FPV Flight Demonstrations for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Autonomy
PY  - 2024
AB  - Small multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), mainly quadcopters, are nowadays ubiquitous in research on aerial autonomy, including serving as scaled-down models for much larger aircraft such as vertical-take-off-and-lift vehicles for urban air mobility. Among the various research use cases, first-person-view (FPV) RC flight experiments allow for collecting data on how human pilots fly such aircraft, which could then be used to compare, contrast, validate, or train (via imitative learning) autonomous flight agents. While this could be uniquely beneficial, especially for studying UAV operation in contextually complex and safety-critical environments such as in human-UAV shared spaces, the lack of inexpensive and open-source hardware/software platforms that offer this capability along with low-level (complete access) to the underlying control software and data remains limited. To address this gap and significantly reduce barriers to human-guided autonomy research with UAVs, this paper presents an open-source software architecture implemented with an inexpensive in-house built quadcopter platform based on the F450 Quadcopter Frame. This setup uses two cameras to provide a dual-view FPV and an open-source flight controller, Pixhawk. The underlying software architecture, developed using the Python-based Kivy library, allows logging telemetry, GPS, control inputs, and camera frame data in a synchronized manner on the ground station computer. Since costs (time) and weather constraints typically limit numbers of physical outdoor flight experiments, this paper also presents a unique AirSim/Unreal Engine based simulation environment and graphical user interface (GUI) - aka digital twin - that provides a Hardware In The Loop (HITL) setup via the Pixhawk flight controller. We demonstrate the usability and reliability of the overall framework through a set of diverse physical FPV flight experiments and corresponding flight tests in the digital twin.

In this study a simple simulation solution was implemented with standard software tools (Python and open-source libraries) to create and test example of an approach to tackle the challenges about combining simple software and abstraction levels of mathematics or physics. The results illustrate that it is possible to implement higher level ideas by simple software implementations like shown in this study.

AB  - An aircraft is made up of a number of complicated systems which work in harmony to ensure safe and trouble-free flight. In order to maintain such a platform, many diagnostic and prognostic techniques have been suggested, mostly aimed at components but some at the system level. Together these form a patchwork approach to the overall problem of efficiently informing aircraft maintenance to the Original Equipment Manufacturers, the operators /airlines, and the Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul organisations. It involves these organisations having to support several different approaches to aircraft health management, and is therefore inefficient and costly. In the current work, a streamlined methodology is put forward. This is based on OSA-CBM (Open System Architecture for Condition Based Maintenance) and can be applied to any aircraft system. Integral with this is the use of mRMR (minimum redundancy maximum relevance) for feature selection, the resulting symptom vector being used for fault diagnosis. This approach is demonstrated on three test cases: the engine, the environmental control system, and the fuel system. In each case, the digital twin setup, simulation conditions for healthy and faulty scenarios, a methodology based on OSA-CBM up to diagnostics are detailed. Diagnostics is carried out for each system in turn, using four machine learning supervised algorithms. The best performing algorithm for each system will then subsequently be used in a vehicle level reasoner called FAVER (A Framework for Aerospace Vehicle Reasoning), which requires these system diagnoses as a starting point for vehicle reasoning and fault ambiguity resolution.

To fully unleash such systems' potential and facilitate their wider adoption, ensuring the trustworthiness of their decision-making under uncertainty is the prime challenge. To overcome this challenge, an intelligent software system and its operating environment should be continuously monitored, tested, and refined during its lifetime operation. Existing technologies, such as digital twins, can enable continuous synchronisation with such systems to reflect their most up-to-date states. Such representations are often in the form of prior-knowledge-based and machine-learning models, together called 'model universe'. In this paper, we present our vision of combining techniques from software engineering, evolutionary computation, and machine learning to support the model universe evolution.

TI  - Exascale Computing for System-Level Engineering: Design, Optimisation and Resilience
PY  - 2020
AB  - The arrival of exascale computers will open new frontiers in our ability to simulate highly complex engineered and natural systems. This will create new opportunities for the design and optimisation of new, highly integrated engineered systems for the future. It will also allow the development of 'digital twins' of complex natural systems, such has the human body and coastal/river regions, that will allow is to explore and manage engineering-led interventions in personalised healthcare and management of the natural environment.  The exascale computers of the future will be highly parallel with hundreds of thousands, or millions of processes, working collectively. Exploiting this remarkable level of parallelism will require dramatic advances in the mathematics, numerical methods, software engineering and software tools that underpin simulation, and will depend on experts in each of these areas coming together. The simulation of the different but tightly coupled physical processes that characterises complex engineered and natural systems poses additional challenges of coordinating the simulation of multiple processes, such as the noise created by an airflow flow around a moving structure under the influence of a magnetic field, or the fluid, solid, electrical and chemical interactions a human body.   This project brings together of working group of experts from computer science, mathematics and engineering to address the challenge of how to simulate coupled physical process at a system level on future exascale systems. It will also address how to integrate into the simulation process the vast quantity of data that can be collected from real systems, how to assess uncertainties and how to interpret the vast quantities of data that exascale simulations will generate. The working group will formulate roadmaps for enabling research for exascale computing, and support research software engineer training for exascale-ready software skills.

TI  - Advancing Probabilistic Machine Learning to Deliver Safer, More Efficient, and Predictable Air Traffic Control
PY  - 2021
AB  - The ambition of this partnership between NATS and The Alan Turing Institute is to develop the fundamental science to deliver the world's first AI system to control a section of airspace in live trials.  Our research will take a hierarchical approach to air traffic control (ATC) by developing a digital twin alongside a multi-agent machine-learning control system for UK airspace. Furthermore, the partnership will develop technical approaches to deploy trustworthy AI systems, considering how safety, explainability and ethics are embedded within our methods, so that we can deliver new tools which work in harmony with human air traffic controllers in a safety-critical environment.  Little has changed in the fundamental infrastructure of UK airspace in the past 50 years, but demand for aviation has increased a hundredfold. Aviation 2050, a recent government green paper, underlines the importance of the aviation network to the prosperity of the UK to the value of &pound;22 billion annually. Yet our nation is at risk without rapid action to modernise our airspace and control methods, to ensure they can handle a future increase in UK passenger traffic of over 50% by 2050 and new challenges arising from unmanned aircraft, both against a backdrop of increasing global pressures to transform the sector's environmental impact.   The augmentation of live air traffic control through the use of AI agents which can handle the complexity and uncertainties in the system has transformative potential for NATS's business. This will positively impact live operations, as well as a research tool and training facility for new ATCOs. Correspondingly, NATS's research vision is to exploit new approaches to AI that enable increases in safety, capacity and environmental sustainability while streamlining air traffic controller training.  The anticipated benefits of AI systems to air traffic control have come at a critical time, providing us with an opportunity to respond effectively to the unprecedented challenges which arise from a triad of crises: the coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, Brexit and global warming. The UK must develop independent technical advances in the sector, without compromising sustainability targets.  The Alan Turing Institute is positioned at the rapidly evolving frontiers of probabilistic machine learning, safe and trustworthy AI and reproducible software engineering. Matching this with the world-leading expertise of NATS, supported by a world-first data set of more than 20 million flight records, means that this partnership is in a unique position to build the first multi AI agents system to deliver tactical control of UK airspace.

AB  - The optimization of complex cyber-physical systems is a crucial task for their correct functioning, usability, and commercial viability. Due to their complexity, scale and resource intensiveness, conventional manual optimization is infeasible in many instances. We investigate the combination of the Digital Twin paradigm and Reinforcement Learning framework to address the long response times, limited availability of data, and the intractability of such systems. Here, the Digital Twin functions as the training environment in different development phases of the optimization. In this position paper we showcase our ongoing research on developing a reference architecture of a Digital Twin-Artificial Intelligence optimization system. This includes presenting the development process of the optimization system in terms of phases, an architecture from four viewpoints and an exemplary implementation.

AB  - System-level testing of healthcare Internet of Things (IoT) applications requires creating a test infrastructure with integrated medical devices and third-party applications. A significant challenge in creating such test infrastructure is that healthcare IoT applications evolve continuously with the addition of new medical devices from different vendors and new services offered by different third-party organizations following different architectures. Moreover, creating test infrastructure with a large number of different types of medical devices is time-consuming, financially expensive, and practically infeasible. Oslo City's healthcare department faced these challenges while working with various healthcare IoT applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a real-world test infrastructure software architecture (HITA) designed for healthcare IoT applications. We evaluated HITA's digital twin (DT) generation component implemented using model-based and machine learning (ML) approaches in terms of DT fidelity, scalability, and time cost of generating DTs. Results show that the fidelity of DTs created using model-based and ML approaches reach 94% and 95%, respectively. Results from operating 100 DTs concurrently show that the DT generation component is scalable and ML-based DTs have a higher time cost.

DO  - 10.1145/3385032.3385041
AB  - Software Engineering must increasingly address the issues of complexity and uncertainty that arise when systems are to be deployed into a dynamic software ecosystem. There is also interest in using digital twins of systems in order to design, adapt and control them when faced with such issues. The use of multi-agent systems in combination with reinforcement learning is an approach that will allow software to intelligently adapt to respond to changes in the environment. This paper proposes a language extension that encapsulates learning-based agents and system building operations and shows how it is implemented in ESL. The paper includes examples the key features and describes the application of agent-based learning implemented in ESL applied to a real-world supply chain.

TI  - Integration of an energy management tool and digital twin for coordination and control of multi-vector smart energy systems
PY  - 2020
VL  - 62
DO  - 10.1016/j.scs.2020.102412
AB  - As Internet of Things (IoT) technologies enable greater communication between energy assets in smart cities, the operational coordination of various energy networks in a city or district becomes more viable. Suitable tools are needed that can harness advanced control and machine learning techniques to achieve environmental, economic and resilience objectives. In this paper, an energy management tool is presented that can offer optimal control, scheduling, forecasting and coordination services to energy assets across a district, enabling optimal decisions under user-defined objectives. The tool presented here can coordinate different sub-systems in a district to avoid the violation of high-level system constraints and is designed in a generic fashion to enable transferable use across different energy sectors. The work demonstrates the potential for a single open-source optimisation framework to be applied across multiple energy vectors, providing local government the opportunity to manage different assets in a coordinated fashion. This is shown through case studies that integrate low-carbon communal heating for social housing with electric vehicle charge-point management to achieve high-level system constraints and local government objectives in the borough of Greenwich, London. The paper illustrates the theoretical methodology, the software architecture and the digital twin-based testing environment underpinning the proposed approach.

PY  - 2021

AB  - Automation technologies have been deployed widely to boost the efficiency of production and operations, to trim the complicated process, and to reduce the human error involved. Nevertheless, aviation remains human-centred and requires collaboration between different parties. Given the lack of a collaborative decision-making training platform for air traffic operations in the industry, this study utilises the concept of cyber-physical systems (CPS) to formulate a system architecture for pilots and air traffic control officers training in collaborative decision making by linking and integrating the virtual counterparts of flights and air traffic control operations. Collaborative decision-making training and the corresponding intelligent automation aids could be realised and supported. A performance analysis via a flight task undertaken with different computational load settings was prepared to evaluate the platform's latency and integrity. The latency is presented using its 95% confidence interval, and integrity is presented using the percentage of data loss during wireless transmission. The results demonstrated convincing performance and a promising system robustness in both domains.

AB  - Limitations regarding process design, optimization, and control often occur when using particular process simulators. With the implementation of connection methodologies, integrated tools could be made by coupling popular process simulation software with each other or with programming environments. In the current paper, we summarized and categorized the existing research regarding the application of multi-software engineering in the chemical industry, with an emphasis on software connections. CAPE-OPEN, COM, OPC, and native integration were discussed in detail, with the intention to serve as a guide for choosing the most suitable software combination and connection. These hybrid systems can handle complex user-defined problems and can be used for decision support, performing custom unit operations, operator training, process optimization, building control systems, and developing digital twins. In this work, we proposed the use of process simulator Aspen HYSYS linked together with the numeric computing platform MATLAB to solve a reaction kinetic parameter identification problem regarding the production of ?-valerolactone.

AB  - Using data analytics to improve industrial planning and operations has become increasingly popular and data scientists are more and more in demand. However, complex data analytics-based software development is challenging. It involves many new roles lacking in traditional software engineering teams - e.g. data scientists and data engineers; use of sophisticated machine learning (ML) approaches replacing many programming tasks; uncertainty inherent in the models; as well as interfacing with models to fulfill software functionalities. These challenges make communication and collaboration within the team and with external stakeholders challenging. In this paper, we describe our experiences in applying our BiDaML (Big Data Analytics Modeling Languages) approach to several large-scale industrial projects. We used our BiDaML modeling toolset that brings all stakeholders around one tool to specify, model and document their big data applications. We report our experience in using and evaluating this tool on three real-world, large-scale applications with teams from: realas.com - a property price prediction website for home buyers; VicRoads - a project seeking to build a digital twin (simulated model) of Victoria's transport network updated in real-time by a stream of sensor data from inductive loop detectors at traffic intersections; and the Alfred Hospital - Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) prediction through Computed Tomography (CT) Scans. These show that our approach successfully supports complex data analytics software development in industrial settings.

TI  - Digital Twin in Practice: Emergent Insights from an Ethnographic-Action Research Study
PY  - 2022
SP  - 1253
EP  - 1260
AB  - Based on an ethnographic action research study for a Digital Twin (DT) deployment on an automated highway maintenance project, this paper reports some of the stumbling blocks that practitioners face while deploying a DT in practice. At the outset, the scope of the case study was broadly defined in terms of digitalization and software development and deployment, which later pivoted toward the concept of Digital Twin during the collective reflection sessions between the project participants. Through an iterative learning cycle via discussions among the various project stakeholders, the case study led to uncovering the roadblocks in practice faced by the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) practitioners. This research finds that the practitioners are facing difficulty in (1) creating a shared understanding among the participants due to the lack of consensus on the Digital Twin concept, (2) adapting and investing in Digital Twin due to inability to exhaustively evaluate and select the appropriate technological capabilities in a Digital Twin, and (3) allocation of resources for Digital Twin development due to the inability to assess the impact of DT on the organizational conditions and processes.

TI  - ManuChain II: Blockchained Smart Contract System as the Digital Twin of Decentralized Autonomous Manufacturing Toward Resilience in Industry 5.0

AB  - In Industry 5.0 vision, machines are empowered with the interaction capability to autonomously make local decisions and coordinate with each other as well as humans. However, how to form a group consensus on the rapid self-organizing of the manufacturing process is critical for achieving manufacturing resilience under disturbances and disruptions. Based on our formerly developed system ManuChain (Leng et al., 2020), this article proposes a blockchained smart contract system (BSCS), named ManuChain II, as the digital twin of a decentralized autonomous manufacturing system for achieving resilience in Industry 5.0. A blockchain-secured multiagent system architecture together with a product data model is established to form the BSCS. The BSCS could prevent tampering with data and enhance the transparency of the product manufacturing process. In BSCS, two types of blockchained smart contracts (SCs) are established with a bi-level interplay computing architecture. The lower-level contracts perform the predefined and learned patterns of task coordination for achieving resilience under internal disruptions. The upper-level contracts are incorporated with communication-efficient decentralized deep-learning algorithms for the learning, updating, transferring, and sharing of coordination patterns used in the autonomous decision in lower-level SCs, thereby achieving the continuous improvement of the system's decentralized autonomous intelligence. Via incorporating the decentralized deep learning algorithms into blockchained SCs, this study reveals a new way to realize the self-organizing intelligence of the manufacturing system for enhancing resilience toward Industry 5.0.
