AB  - Digital Twins are digital representations of real-world entities. Their behavior resembles the behavior of the real entity at all times. They are candidates for the evaluation of complex adaptive embedded systems, for example in the domains of autonomous driving, or industry 4.0 production systems. However, as most simulators are specialized and only simulate selected aspects of a system with highest accuracy, the creation of a Digital Twin requires the coupling of simulators and their simulation models. Related work indicates that this is still a labor-intensive and manual task. In this paper, we present an architecture framework that transfers approaches from Component-Based Software Engineering to simulator coupling. Simulators are encapsulated as simulation components with defined interfaces. The creation of a Digital Twin is supported by orchestrating simulation components. We present the formal definition of simulation components and our simulation framework, as well as the rules for coupling simulation components into Digital Twins.

TI  - Quality assessment of the simulation modeling process
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Quality assessment is not common practice in the engineering field of simulation modeling. Though the well-known quality aspects (correctness, reliability, usability, etc.) are relevant to simulation modeling, model validation is the favorite simulation feature. This does not imply that a successful model validation will guarantee a proper handling of the other quality aspects. In this paper an integrated approach to the quality improvement problem is proposed. This approach incorporates project management, good practice in software engineering and improvement of the simulation modeling process (SMP) in particular. The SMP has to be optimized by means of a model (QUASIMODEM) of the SMP. QUASIMODEM will facilitate the intended improvements through five stages of the upgrading process. QUASIMODEM has been designed as a tool and will be built to support this approach. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Several studies in information security have emphasized the value of modeling and simulation for education, training, and testing. This paper briefly argues on the importance of simulation in the study of information security and describes general features of a set of simulations models and in particular one of our object-oriented simulation models of a firewall system. Several of these models are used for studying various aspects of perimeter defense in network security. These models have been implemented in Java with the PsimJ simulation package. The Java source code for the models, the downloadable simulation package, and more detailed description can be found in the Psim Web page.The set of simulation models mentioned previously is part of an effort to develop a larger set of well-defined object-oriented discrete-event simulation models for the educating information security students and professionals in computer science, software engineering, information technology, and other related disciplines.

TI  - Research on the Simulation Model of Rail Profile Measurement System Based on Zemax
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Line structured light profile measurement is an important technique for rail profile detection. Currently, simulation analysis is instrumental in the research of rail grinding mechanism and track structure dynamics. Optical simulation design software has also been subjected to considerable research in optical system design, simulation modeling, and error analysis. However, few reports have focused on the simulation modeling of the line laser rail profile measurement system. In view of this situation, a simulation model of the rail profile measurement system based on Zemax software is proposed. The proposed simulation model is of guiding significance for designing optical systems, selecting optical elements, and improving measurement accuracy. It can provide theoretical support for the accuracy improvement and reliability evaluation of the rail profile measurement system. hodsMethods The rail profile measurement system is divided into image acquisition, system calibration, and profile measurement modules. The image acquisition module obtains the rail laser cross section image and mainly includes the line laser, lens, and camera. The system calibration module obtains the calibration parameters, i. e., the transformation relationship between the image plane in the pixel coordinate system and the measurement plane in the world coordinate system. The profile measurement module extracts the center pixel coordinates of the light stripe from the rail laser cross section image obtained using the image acquisition module. Then, it transforms the central pixel coordinates of the light stripe into the world coordinate system using the calibration data to determine the real rail profile. Based on the division of the system function modules, the system modeling process is divided into three steps (Fig. 3). In the first step, the image acquisition module is modeled (Fig. 8). First, the optical model of the main components is established in the Zemax non-sequential mode. Then, the system simulation model is established by combining the optical model of the components and optical structure parameters to ensure that the system simulation model has the image acquisition function. In the second step, the system calibration module is modeled based on the plane target calibration method (Fig. 10). The image acquisition module collects the calibration board images under different poses, and the system calibration parameters are calculated. In the third step, the profile measurement module simulates the rail profile measurement process (Fig. 12). The image acquisition module scans the rail at a certain sampling interval along the rail direction (extension direction) and obtains the rail laser crosssection image at equal intervals. The real rail profile is calculated using the rail laser cross section image; hence, the system simulation model has the profile measurement function (Fig. 9).Results and Discussions To comprehensively evaluate the measurement accuracy of the system simulation model, component accuracy verification, rail simulation measurement, and actual rail measurement experiments are performed (Figs. 15-17). Experimental results show that the root mean square error (0.049 mm) obtained using the system simulation model is close to the root mean square error (0. 066 mm) obtained using the actual measurement device based on the 20 repeated measurement data of rail vertical wear (Table 5). The system simulation model achieves high accuracy, and the simulation measurement results are consistent with the actual situation, thus demonstrating that the simulation model can better simulate the rail profile measurement system.Conclusions A simulation model of the rail profile measurement system based on Zemax is proposed. The simulation model has image acquisition, system calibration, and profile measurement functions. The results show that the simulation model is consistent with the measurement results of the actual measurement system, and the simulation model can be used to simulate the rail profile measurement process using line structured light. The differences between the simulation model and the actual system are highlighted from different aspects, thus providing a reference for further improving the simulation model. The system simulation model can be used for analyzing related problems in the field of rail profile measurement, e. g., evaluating the impact of lasers on both sides of the rail that are not coplanar and generating rail surface defect samples using the system simulation model to solve the problem of a lack of negative samples in deep learning. Moreover, the system simulation model can be used for experimental verification and laboratory or field experiments can be performed simultaneously with system simulation experiments. The simulation data can not only verify the experimental results but also provide guidance for the experimental design. Finally, the system simulation model can be used to predict the results. Some tests unsuitable for field tests or parameters and cannot be well controlled can be performed using the simulation model, such as the vehicle body pose compensation test. The simulation model provides a new analysis method for studying rail profile measurements using line structured light and offers guiding significance for optical system design, optical element selection, and measurement accuracy improvement.

AB  - In 2017, Academic Emergency Medicine convened a consensus conference entitled, "Catalyzing System Change through Health Care Simulation: Systems, Competency, and Outcomes." This article, a product of the breakout session on "understanding complex interactions through systems modeling," explores the role that computer simulation modeling can and should play in research and development of emergency care delivery systems. This article discusses areas central to the use of computer simulation modeling in emergency care research. The four central approaches to computer simulation modeling are described (Monte Carlo simulation, system dynamics modeling, discrete-event simulation, and agent-based simulation), along with problems amenable to their use and relevant examples to emergency care. Also discussed is an introduction to available software modeling platforms and how to explore their use for research, along with a research agenda for computer simulation modeling. Through this article, our goal is to enhance adoption of computer simulation, a set of methods that hold great promise in addressing emergency care organization and design challenges.

TI  - Software process simulation modelling: A survey of practice
T2  - JOURNAL OF SIMULATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, simulation modelling of software development processes has attracted considerable interest in software engineering. Despite the growing interest, there is little literature available that reports on the state-of-practice in software process simulation modelling (SPSM). We report results of a survey of simulation in SPSM and relate it to simulation practice in general. The results of this survey indicate that software process simulation (SPS) modellers are generally methodical, work on large complex problems, develop large models, and have a systematic simulation modelling process in place. However, on the other hand, the simulation modelling process and simulation model evaluation have been identified as the most urgent problems to be addressed in SPSM. The results from this investigation are interesting and bring many problems into focus. The paper helps understand the characteristics of the SPSM and SPS modellers, and highlights areas of interest for further in-depth research in the SPSM.

AB  - This paper introduces an IP evaluation and delivery framework that operates within Java applets. The use of such applets; allows circuit designers to create, evaluate, test, and obtain FPGA circuits directly within a web browser. Based on the JHDL design tool, these applets allow structural viewing, circuit simulation, and netlist generation of application-specific circuits.An important component of this framework is the ability to deliver black-box simulation models as executable Java applets. These applet-based simulation models can be tied to third-party simulation tools using network sockets. Several techniques for interfacing black-box applet models to external simulators are described.

AB  - Software quality has become a critical issue in software engineering because affects systems development costs, delivery schedules, and user satisfaction. In specific software products, an early quality evaluation can be done by using simulation techniques over the architectural design. However, not all architectural designs can be transformed into simulation models. This paper presents a set of simulation models based on standard architectural components that helps to compose web architec-tures simulation models in order to analyze its behavior. It also includes the definition and modeling of different types of mechanisms that help to simulate consumer's behavior. These mechanisms allow generating the inputs required to the quality evaluation (that is, software requirements) and could be used in other situations. All simulation models proposed were formalized using Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS). In this context, this work gives the foundations needed to make a future evaluation of specific quality attributes for web applications.

AB  - We present a model-based verification technique built on selective and pragmatic use of formal methods, by using simplified model checking tools that focus on error detection rather than formalized proofs. This framework is to check and confirm that the trajectories and events of DEVS-Driven Modeling Language (DDML) simulation models and that of the real system agree in order to achieve replicative, predictive and structural validity through the lightweight application of formal methods. This is to reduce and ease the Simulation model verification efforts while increasing the coverage of the process, in order to verify the transformational accuracy of the model development process, increase confidence in the simulation model and allow for performance evaluation of simulation models. This framework provides a model refinement iterative procedure that helps to enhance the DEVS Simulation Model, correct errors or adapt to changing contextual requirements. This refinement procedure is applicable to evolutionary software development and systems requiring rapid prototyping, in order to meet up with changing requirements of such systems with the aid of iterative refinement. Furthermore, we present a case study example of a GSM telecommunication system to reveal the ability of this framework to not only formally verify system but also refine their models.

AB  - With an increasing complexity and scale, sufficient evaluation of Information Systems (IS) becomes a challenging and difficult task. Simulation modeling has proven as suitable and efficient methodology for evaluating IS and IS artifacts, presupposed it meets certain quality demands. However, existing research on simulation modeling quality solely focuses on quality in terms of accuracy and credibility, disregarding the role of additional quality aspects. Therefore, this paper proposes two design artifacts in order to ensure a holistic quality view on simulation quality. First, associated literature is reviewed in order to extract relevant quality factors in the context of simulation modeling, which can be used to evaluate the overall quality of a simulated solution before, during or after a given project. Secondly, the deduced quality factors are integrated in a quality assessment framework to provide structural guidance on the quality assessment procedure for simulation. In line with a Design Science Research (DSR) approach, we demonstrate the eligibility of both design artifacts by means of prototyping as well as an example case. Moreover, the assessment framework is evaluated and iteratively adjusted with the help of expert feedback.

AB  - The optimization of complex cyber-physical systems is a crucial task for their correct functioning, usability, and commercial viability. Due to their complexity, scale and resource intensiveness, conventional manual optimization is infeasible in many instances. We investigate the combination of the Digital Twin paradigm and Reinforcement Learning framework to address the long response times, limited availability of data, and the intractability of such systems. Here, the Digital Twin functions as the training environment in different development phases of the optimization. In this position paper we showcase our ongoing research on developing a reference architecture of a Digital Twin-Artificial Intelligence optimization system. This includes presenting the development process of the optimization system in terms of phases, an architecture from four viewpoints and an exemplary implementation.

TI  - A SIMULATION MODEL FOR FAULT TOLERANCE EVALUATION
T2  - UNIVERSITY POLITEHNICA OF BUCHAREST SCIENTIFIC BULLETIN SERIES C-ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we present a simulation model designed to evaluate fault tolerance solutions in large scale distributed systems. This model extends the MONARC simulation model with new capabilities for fault tolerance simulation. The model includes failure behavior and capabilities to detect and react to faults. We also present an implementation of this model in MONARC, together with specific evaluation results. The model's implementation considers permanent and transient failures occurring within processing units, network components, as well as databases. The model is easily extendable, allowing the additions of new failure models as required by user experiments. The model can be used in conjunction with key performance metrics, being able to easily pinpoint the likely points or areas of failures in the simulated environments.

TI  - Cooperative Sensing and Heterogeneous Information Fusion in VCPS: A Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cooperative sensing and heterogeneous information fusion are critical to realize vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPSs). This paper makes the first attempt to quantitatively measure the quality of VCPS by designing a new metric called Age of View (AoV). Specifically, we first present the system architecture where heterogeneous information can be cooperatively sensed and uploaded via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications in vehicular edge computing (VEC). Logical views are constructed by fusing the heterogeneous information at edge nodes. Further, we formulate the problem by deriving a cooperative sensing model based on the multi-class M/G/1 priority queue, and defining the AoV by modeling the timeliness, completeness and consistency of the logical views. On this basis, a multi-agent difference reward based actor-critic with V2I bandwidth allocation (MDRAC-VBA) solution is proposed. In particular, the system state includes vehicle sensed information, edge cached information and view requirements. The vehicle action space consists of the sensing frequencies and uploading priorities of information. A difference-reward-based credit assignment is designed to divide the system reward, which is defined as the VCPS quality, into the difference reward for vehicles. Edge node allocates V2I bandwidth to vehicles based on predicted vehicle trajectories and view requirements. Finally, we build the simulation model and give a comprehensive performance evaluation, which conclusively demonstrates the superiority of MDRAC-VBA.

AB  - In the early development stages of embedded systems, fundamental decisions concerning the system architecture and a proper hardware / software partition must be made. The choices determine, e.g. power consumption, performance, and other system features. For this reason, a method plus supporting tools for the fast, efficient, and automated evaluation of system design alternatives is required.In this contribution, we present the MIRA Framework and a novel method based on Extended Queuing Network Models (EQN) linked to a set of simulation models for architectural exploration and hardware / software tradeoff analysis. The MIRA Framework consits of hardware components expressed in XML and function represented as UML Activity Diagrams. Activity threads, introduced in this contribution, define building rules for the simulation models. This method fosters the combined simulation and analysis of system behavior as well as architectural exploration of design alternatives.As current experimental work and evaluation with nontrivial examples show, the presented method allows for fast and efficient generation of simulation models and an accurate prediction of performance measures.

TI  - Capturing Deviations From Design Intent in Building Simulation Models for Risk Assessment
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulation-based methods are emerging to address the challenges of complex systems risk assessment, and this paper identifies two problems related to the use of such methods. First, the methods cannot identify new hazards if the simulation model builders are expected to foresee the hazards and incorporate the abnormal behavior related to the hazard into the simulation model. Therefore, this paper uses the concept of deviation from design intent to systematically capture abnormal conditions that may lead to component failures, hazards, or both. Second, simulation-based risk assessment methods should explicitly consider what expertise is required from the experts that build and use the simulation models-the transfer of the methods to real engineering practice will be severely hindered if they must be performed by persons that are expert in domain safety as well as advanced computer simulation-based methods. This paper addresses both problems in the context of the functional failure identification and propagation (FFIP) method. One industrially established risk assessment method, hazard and operability study (HAZOP), is harnessed to systematically obtain the deviations from design intent in the application under study. An information system presents a user interface that is understandable to HAZOP professionals, so that their inputs are transparently entered to a data model that captures the deviations. From the data model, instructions for configuring FFIP simulation models are printed in a form that is understandable for FFIP experts. The method is demonstrated for discovering a hazard resulting from system-wide fault propagation in a boiling water reactor case.

TI  - Research on safety simulation model and algorithm of dynamic system based on artificial neural network
T2  - SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuous expansion of computer system simulation applications, the dynamic system modeling problems that people face have become more and more complex. This paper mainly studies dynamic system simulation models and algorithms based on artificial neural networks. This article mainly focuses on some practical problems of dynamic system simulation, and studies the artificial neural network model and corresponding algorithm suitable for dynamic system modeling. First, it summarizes the existing artificial neural network simulation models of dynamic systems: multi-layer feedforward network relationship model without feedback, recursive network relationship model with feedback, and their network topology diagrams are drawn. Secondly, a quantum genetic algorithm is proposed to optimize the parameters of artificial neural networks and feedforward process neural networks. To achieve the preprocessing of the parameters. Next, based on the analysis and research of BP neural network theory, this paper comprehensively compares the neural network models established under various network structures and algorithms, and establishes the simulation model based on the BP neural network monitoring data system, and compares the results with the monitoring data obtained in the field. The hidden layer of neural network with 4 and 6 nodes will increase the convergence step. When the number of nodes is 10 and 12, the convergence rate may reach 46 steps. This shows that if the non-display layer with different number of nodes in the same layer is selected for the same system simulation model based on artificial neural network, the repetition number of convergence steps of the prediction model will be different.

AB  - Quantitative analysis of software systems is being recognized as an important issue in the software development process. Performance analysis can help to address quantitative system analysis from the early stages of the software development life cycle, e.g., to compare design alternatives or to identify system bottlenecks. Modeling software systems by simulation allows the analyst to represent detailed characteristics of the system. We consider simulation for performance evaluation of software architectures specified by UML. We derive a simulation model for annotated UML software architectures. First we propose the annotation for some UML diagrams to describe performance parameters. Then we derive the simulation model by automatically extracting information about Use Case and Activity Diagrams from the XMI descriptions of UML diagrams. This information is used to build a discrete-event simulation model, which is finally executed. Simulation results are inserted back into the original UML diagrams as tagged values to provide feedback at the software architectural design level.

T2  - MULTI-AGENT-BASED SIMULATION XXIV, MABS 2023
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th International Workshop on Multi-Agent-Based Simulation (MABS)
CL  - London, ENGLAND
AB  - Large open-source projects such as the Linux kernel provide a unique opportunity to analyze many of the socio-technical processes of open-source software development. Understanding how cognitive workload affects the quality of code and productivity of work in such environments can help better protect open-source projects from potential vulnerabilities and better utilize limited developer resources.In this paper, we present two agent-based simulation models of developer interactions on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML). We also develop several non-simulation machine learning (ML) models predicting patch reversal, to compare with our agent-based simulation models. In our experiments, simulation models perform slightly better than ML models at predicting the expected number and proportion of reverted patches, and considerably better in matching the distribution of these values. Results are further improved using an explicit process model within the simulation, modeling the patch view process and associated cognitive load on LKML reviewers when new code changes are introduced by developers. We find that the process model can capture the repeated, structured multi-agent activities within a socio-technical community.

TI  - Evaluating the learning effectiveness of using simulations in software project management education: results from a twice replicated experiment
T2  - INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing demand for software project managers in industry requires strategies for the development of management-related knowledge and skills of the current and future software workforce. Although several educational approaches help to develop the necessary skills in a university setting, few empirical studies are currently available to characterise and compare their effects.This paper presents the results of a twice replicated experiment that evaluates the learning effectiveness of using a process simulation model for educating computer science students in software project management. While the experimental group applied a System Dynamics simulation model, the control group used the well-known COCOMO model as a predictive tool for project planning.The results of each empirical study indicate that students using the simulation model gain a better understanding about typical behaviour patterns of software development projects. The combination of the results from the initial experiment and the two replications with meta-analysis techniques corroborates this finding. Additional analysis shows that the observed effect can mainly be attributed to the use of the simulation model in combination with a web-based role-play scenario. This finding is strongly supported by information gathered from the debriefing questionnaires of subjects in the experimental group. They consistently rated the simulation-based role-play scenario as a very useful approach for learning about issues in software project management. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simulation games are gaining increased interest among academic researchers and practitioners where conventional teaching approaches are not adequate. In the Software Engineering field, simulation games are commonly used for enhancing the learning and understanding of complex themes such as software processes. This complexity is represented by intrinsic software development characteristics such as multiple feedback loops and cause-effect delays. One fundamental aspect for the development of a simulation game is the definition of its simulation model. A simulation model contains some dynamic features and phenomena of the system it represents. It typically involves a set of assumptions concerning the system operation and it is used to translate the underlying system model, with given inputs, producing its behavior pattern. In this work, we describe an approach to create an educational simulation model derived from academic and industrial experiences. We focus on the systematic activities executed during its development. The created model was applied in a Software Process Improvement simulation game, named SPIAL (Software Process Improvement Animated Learning Environment). A set of important issues were identified. Our work can help developers during the creation of simulation games for educational purposes.

TI  - Developing an agent-based simulation model of software evolution
T2  - INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: In attempt to simulate the factors that affect the software evolution behaviour and possibly predict it, several simulation models have been developed recently. The current system dynamic (SD) simulation model of software evolution process was built based on actor-network theory (ANT) of software evolution by using system dynamic environment, which is not a suitable environment to reflect the complexity of ANT theory. In addition the SD model has not been investigated for its ability to represent the real-world process of software evolution.Objectives: This paper aims to re-implements the current SD model to an agent-based simulation environment 'Repast' and checks the behaviour of the new model compared to the existing SD model. It also aims to investigate the ability of the new Repast model to represent the real-world process of software evolution.Methods: a new agent-based simulation model is developed based on the current SD model's specifications and then tests similar to the previous model tests are conducted in order to perform a comparative evaluation between of these two results. In addition an investigation is carried out through an interview with an expert in software development area to investigate the model's ability to represent real-world process of software evolution.Results: The Repast model shows more stable behaviour compared with the SD model. Results also found that the evolution health of the software can be calibrated quantitatively and that the new Repast model does have the ability to represent real-world processes of software evolution.Conclusion: It is concluded that by applying a more suitable simulation environment (agent-based) to represent ANT theory of software evolution, that this new simulation model will show more stable bahaviour compared with the previous SD model; And it will also shows the ability to represent (at least quantatively) the real-world aspect of software evolution.

AB  - Cyber-physical systems play a crucial role in various applications, ranging from critical infrastructure control like power grid to the technological revolution of Industry 4.0 aimed to integrate and automate the manufacturing value chain. The Systems Modeling Language (SysML) represents a significant and increasing segment of industrial support for the development of cyber-physical systems partly due to the language's built-in mechanisms for modeling the requirements. In this paper, we leverage goal-oriented obstacle analysis to systematically identify the impediments to the fulfillment of requirements, and further examine several machine learning algorithms' capabilities of classifying these impediments into the components that constitute the cyber physical systems. We then investigate the extent to which a state-of-the-practice SysML tool simulates these obstacles, thereby assessing the risks of system failures at the requirements level.

AB  - Model deficiencies, despite their negative influences on assessment of modeling and simulation (M&S) applications, carry a large amount of insightful information, which can be used to measure different aspects of the M&S development process and its verification and validation (V&V). Although there already exist various categorizations of model deficiencies, none of which can be used as a measurement tool to classify and analyze deficiency data collected in practice. This paper describes a framework for developing model deficiency classifications and the pilot application of the established classification scheme as a quantitative method to measure and control the V&V process being conducted. Investigations indicate that the proposed approach is capable of providing process diagnoses reflecting the real problems and identifying the improvement potentials. Based on the findings achieved in practice, a planning and tailoring concept is being developed for efficiently applying different V&V techniques in a simulation study.

AB  - Many of the non conventional software development methodologies (such as object-oriented analysis methodology) and tools (such as visual programming environment) have been applied in real life projects. These projects have been started without sufficient previous training given to the developers. An increment in the productivity has been seen as the projects progress. This paper proposes a simulation model for software development which can deal with variances of developers' productivity during software development. As the proposed model takes into account the developer's learning curve, it can be used to compute a developer's productivity and the quantity of gain to the developer's knowledge in executing an activity. The proposed model has been applied to four typical scenarios in our case study. The results show that it is highly practicable. An outline of a project planning prototype which is based on the proposed model is presented. The prototype can be used to make project plans which take the developer's learning curve into consideration.

AB  - The rapid growth of software industry has led to a significant increase in the production of a variety of data during software development process, highlighting the apparent need for improved data quality management. As an effective means of software process research and practice, Software Process Simulation Modeling (SPSM) requires large amount and high quality data that precisely depicts what happens during the development process. Accordingly, process simulation models can be used as a reference framework for assessing the issues in data management and data governance from a process perspective. The objective of the work reported in this paper is to provide insights into the data issues in real-world industrial settings and the corresponding coping strategies for software process modelers in particular in order to assist them in preparing and assessing data for their simulation models when conducting effective SPSM in the real-world settings. This paper reports on an empirical investigation that applies software process simulation practices to study the data issues and the data governance strategies based on an industrial case from one global ICT enterprise. As the outcome, a refined process for data preparation is presented, along with a taxonomy of the data issues and the corresponding coping strategies. This paper also explores traceability recovery approaches to mine more accurate process state information from software artifacts and analyzes the impact of the recovered data traceability information by evaluating the improved fidelity of the process simulation model.

AB  - In this position paper, we explore a way to assess deployment architectures for intelligent Cyber-Physical Systems (iCPS). Our long-term goal is to establish a method that allows a software architect of iCPS to choose an appropriate deployment architecture, based on requirements on quality, cost and security. As the first step towards the goal, this paper first presents an abstract model of iCPS to capture the possible deployment configurations. We then propose a method that assesses cost-related attributes for the configurations. Finally, we investigate security threats within different configurations, to help the engineer to achieve the configuration choice.

AB  - Responding to the rapidly growing market share for Information Systems (IS) based on Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), the demand emerges for methods of measuring the value of SOA-based IS projects. The goal of the present research is to adapt available methods of project assessment to this expanding demand. This study describes a new method which takes into consideration a possibility to divide deployment and evolution of SOA-based IS into separate flows, one per service. Like that the process of value assessment could become more precise and exact compared to other known methods which use the single flow for the whole project. In addition the work proposes Real Options for calculating such components of the value as flexibility. The described method is validated using a specific simulation model. Value assessment of a real IS project is performed using the developed method and the simulation model.

TI  - Simulating watersheds using loosely integrated model components: Evaluation of computational scaling using OpenMI
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Complicated research and management questions regarding watershed systems often require the use of more than one simulation model. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a means to integrate multiple simulation models to predict holistic system response. In this paper we explore the use of a component-based approach for the runtime integration of models, implemented as "plug-and-play" software components. The motivation for this work is to quantify performance overhead costs introduced by adopting a component-based paradigm for loosely integrating hydrologic simulation models. We construct a standard rainfall/runoff watershed model using the Open Modeling Interface (OpenMI) Software Development Kit (SDK) where infiltration, surface runoff, and channel routing processes are each implemented as independent model components. We then analyze the performance of this loosely integrated model to quantify computational scaling, using the Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System (HMS) for comparison. Our results suggest that the overhead introduced by runtime communication of data is not significant when applied for semi-distributed watershed modeling. Our analysis was limited to semi-distributed watershed modeling, however, and future research is needed to understand performance and accuracy for more data demanding hydrologic models.

CP  - 51st Annual Meeting of the Congress-of-Neurological-Surgeons
CL  - SAN DIEGO, CA
AB  - The development of models using multiple modelling paradigms is necessary to formulate and study current problems in environmental science. To simplify the coupling of those models, a formal basis for a high-level specification of such models must be set up. In this paper, we propose a discrete event system specification (DEVS) based modelling framework as a formal basis in environmental modelling. The formal framework ensures that the models are reusable and interoperable components with well defined interfaces. Moreover, a wide variety of modelling paradigms can be expressed in the DEVS formalism. We also extend the modelling paradigms that can be expressed in the DEVS framework with two techniques: Feedback-DEVS for the specification of supervised-learning models and Vector-DEVS for the specification of models in vector space. JDEVS is the Java implementation of the framework. It enables discrete event, general purpose, object oriented, component based, GIS connected, collaborative, visual simulation model development and execution. A Feedback-DEVS neural-network model and a cellular infiltration model are described as experiments using JDEVS. Those models are later coupled to show the new modelling scenarios enabled by the use of a formal framework and the flexibility of the software. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing demand for software project managers in industry requires strategies for the development of the management-related knowledge and skills of the current and future software workforce. Although several approaches help teach the required skills in a university setting, few empirical studies are currently available to characterize and compare their effects.This paper presents results of an externally replicated controlled experiment that evaluates the learning effectiveness of using a process simulation model for educating computer science students in software project management. While the experimental group applies a system dynamics (SD) simulation model, the control group uses the well-known COCOMO model as a predictive tool for project planning.The results of the empirical study indicate that students using the simulation model gain a better understanding about typical behavior patterns of software development projects. The combination of the results from the initial experiment and the replication corroborates this finding. Additional analysis shows that the observed effect can mainly be attributed to the use of the simulation model in combination with a web-based role-play scenario. This finding is strongly supported by information gathered from the debriefing questionnaires of subjects in the experimental group. They consistently rated the simulation-based role-play scenario as a very useful approach for learning about issues in software project management.

AB  - The software-based systems, alone do not cause any risk; but the risk is posed when the software-based systems are considered in the context of general systems where potential risks or hazards exist. Cyber-physical systems are cited as instances of software-based systems. Nowadays, safety and reliability of cyber-physical systems are considerably important due to the increasing complexity of these systems. Risk management techniques are required to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. Generally, safety and reliability methods are important in a risk management process among them software fault tree analysis (SFTA) and software failure modes and effects analysis (SFMEA) methods can be utilised. The main purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive survey and evaluation of the currently available approaches for software safety and reliability methods in cyber-physical systems in order to reflect the state of the art of this active area.

AB  - With the increasing demand for embedded intelligence in many diverse areas of application, manufacturers are working on designing and developing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) that meet the rapidly growing demand of the market. CPS require tight integration between virtual and physical artifacts. Architectural evaluation is one way to overcome the complexity of this integration, yet it is a challenging task. One possible approach to help systems engineers and software architects evaluate their design before implementing it is simulation. Simulation can reduce expensive prototypes by testing the system under certain conditions that would be too risky and too costly to consider in a prototype. Nevertheless, existing commercial and academic simulation platforms are often domain-specilic, require a certain amount of manual effort, and do not support straightforward coupling of different software components. This paper presents a SaaS-based (Software-as-a-Service) simulation platform that aims to solve these challenges. It enables easy abstraction of software components, composition of complex architectural scenarios, and the evaluation of architecture design by means of simulation. The proposed platform is a web-based, graphical architectural simulation infrastructure. In this paper, we present the platform along with a simulation example based on a security aspect of a vehicle system to illustrate the platform's capabilities.

AB  - Context: Cyber physical systems are getting pervasive in our every-day life. For their development the industry needs highly-qualified and skilled employees. The employees need to have a wide breadth of knowledge in many engineering disciplines and possess excellent soft skills. Ideally, the needed skills are taught in practical settings.Problem: The versatility of the problems in development of cyber physical systems poses a challenge for the teaching. A common approach to teaching software engineering concepts is to have students form teams to create a software product; this allows them to experience the problems first hand. However, this approach, compared with "traditional" software engineering and software development, is much more difficult for cyber-physical systems, due to the need to have a wide understanding in multiple engineering fields. At the same time, the education of engineering concepts lack on teaching of soft skills that are often key success factors for engineering projects.Approach: We developed a novel task-centric holistic agile approach on teaching cyber physical systems. The concept is task-centric concluding five teaching approaches that may be used when needed. The concept focuses the teaching of technical skills and soft skills.Result: The proposed concept allows students to have an insight into the difficulties involved in development of cyberphysical systems from multiple points of view in a realistic way.Conclusion: The holistic agile approach on teaching cyber physical systems has the potential to reinforce conceptual instruction with hands-on learning at a fraction of the time and cost that would be required to run a true cyber-physical systems development project.

AB  - The rise of complex Cyber-Physical Systems has led to many initiatives to promote automation of the assurance of their dependability. There exists mature practices and tools to perform necessary activities to provide evidence that a system satisfies dependability requirements. However, there is few harmonized an integrated framework that can support both the definition of the evidence and their collection and management from the specification to the V&V activities to testify of the assurance of those systems in compliance with standards. This paper presents Sophia, a framework that supports assurance of critical cyber physical systems using compositional model-based approaches. Sophia features a wide range of dependability analysis tools targeting all phases of system lifecycle for development of cyber physical systems. Sophia further helps trace the developed analysis outcomes to the requirements in standards for compliance support. We have validated the framework components through different case studies that indicate its usefulness and efficiency in helping prepare for certification of the systems.

AB  - Systems modeling practice lacks security analysis tools that can interface with modeling languages to facilitate security by design. Security by design is a necessity in the age of safety critical cyber-physical systems, where security violations can cause hazards. Currently, the overlap between security and safety is narrow. But deploying cyber-physical systems means that today's adversaries can intentionally trigger accidents. By implementing security assessment tools for modeling languages we are better able to address threats earlier in the system's lifecycle and, therefore, assure their safe and secure behavior in their eventual deployment. We posit that cyber-physical systems security modeling is practiced insufficiently because it is still addressed similarly to information technology systems.

TI  - A simulation model for strategic management process of software projects
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a simulation model for the strategic management process of software development projects is presented. The proposed model simulates the implications of strategic decisions on factors such as cost, risk, budget and schedule of software projects. The main advantage of the proposed model is that it provides an integrated framework wherein risk management, cost estimation, and project management planning for the strategic management process of software development projects are linked. The results of the simulation of the project management planning determine the budget and schedule required for a project. Different strategic management decisions pose different sets of risks, each of which require different cost commitments. Hence, each strategic decision requires a project management plan with its own unique budget and schedule of software development. Thus, the simulation model estimates the risk and cost under different strategic decisions and maps them according to the project management plans. Therefore, the proposed integrated framework helps identify the best strategic option for the development and management of software projects. The proposed simulation model is nonspecific because it contains generic plug and play components that facilitate the use of any set of risk assessment, cost estimation models and project management tools. Therefore, it provides a flexible solution to software organisations and managers of software development projects. The simulation model is applied to a case study, which showed the effect of different strategic decisions on the risk and cost of the different phases of software development and ultimately on the budget and schedule required to complete the project. It therefore provides critical insights in identifying the best strategy for the development of software projects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent technological progress in computational engineering and systems design will enable the vision of autonomous driving coming true anytime soon. Functional but particularly also qualitative aspects of automotive functions are therefore gaining in importance more than ever before. This is due to the growing complexity of modern vehicles that gradually evolve into cyber-physical systems giving rise to the increasingly ambitious challenge of reliably validating the non-/functional integration of all their inherent subsystems. Thus, whereas traditional approaches to component and system testing are becoming more and more inappropriate for costs and general viability reasons, simulation-based methodologies offer an adequate solution due to their commonly scalable and generic nature. However, this is only true given a sufficiently high fidelity of the applied simulation models and a straightforward-in-use yet powerful-in-service evaluation platform with flexible support for execution semantics nesting, co-simulator coupling, and interfacing downstream tools with monitoring and visualization capabilities.In this regard, we introduce our concept of a continuous integration platform allowing for virtually prototyping technical systems of any kind that is applicable at any stage of the development process thanks to arbitrary levels of abstraction and wide-range tooling compatibility. This platform is based on the approved FERAL simulation framework at its core combined with versatile architectural components that are adaptable for domain-specific and cross-domain use cases. We focus this work on Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) functions and showcase the end-user operation of the instantiated platform from the configuration of traffic scenarios over adjusting the functional logic and parameter values up to the visual validation of simulation results.

TI  - Modelling biological nutrient removal activated sludge systems - a review
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The external nitrification (EN) biological nutrient removal (BNR) activated sludge (ENBNRAS) system shows considerable promise for full-scale implementation. As an aid for this implementation, a mathematical simulation model would be an invaluable tool. To develop such a model, a study was conducted to select the most suitable simulation model to serve as a starting point for further development. For this, the existing available simulation models for BNRAS systems are compared with one another and evaluated against experimental observations in the literature and on ENBNRAS systems. One process immediately apparent to be crucially important is the anoxic growth of phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs), with associated PAO denitrification and anoxic P uptake for polyP formation. These linked processes are lacking in the earlier kinetic simulation models for BNRAS systems, which were based on aerobic PAO growth and P uptake only, but have been incorporated into the more recent kinetic models. This provides a substantive body of information on modelling this aspect. Other processes of significance identified to require consideration are anaerobic slowly biodegradable COD (SBCOD) hydrolysis to readily biodegradable COD (RBCOD), and COD loss. Both processes have significant impact on the predicted BEPR performance. Due to the uncertainties associated with the mechanisms and quantification of these two processes, it is concluded that the most extensively validated kinetic simulation model should be selected for development, and that the omissions in this model should be addressed progressively, using the relevant information drawn from the existing models, the literature and observations on ENBNRAS systems.

AB  - The application of models and simulations is well-established in systems engineering and development. To adapt this approach to the digital age, we propose the concept of "cyber-physical modeling and simulation (CPMS)" which enables to constitute cyber-physical systems (CPS) with scalable complexity, modularity and variability in size. Based thereon, we derive a reference architecture for designing demonstrators for industrial CPS. The reference architecture offers a structured design space and attributed components which constitute the demonstrators with regard to their application objectives and scenarios. As a viability assessment, we apply the proposed reference architecture by developing the instantiation "Portable Industrial Demonstrator for Cyber-Physical Systems (PID4CPS)". (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The rise of extensive monitoring systems and the availability of low-cost sensors as well as affordable computing power has led to the development of various big data and simulation model applications in the building sector. Nevertheless, many of these promising approaches face a common hindrance for the widespread application. In case of the big data applications, training data is often limited. Much the same, simulation models often lack required input data and require extensive work for calibration. Standard practices are often preferred to innovative approaches because construction and commissioning businesses are highly cost-sensitive. Therefore, we identified the need for a holistic approach for the combined use of machine learning and simulation techniques. In this paper, we present a toolchain to generate models and data needed for the application of innovative building automation and control tools. Using the data available during the construction process, machine-learning algorithms are employed to determine the type and location of data points in devices. From the relations of data points, the system architecture is derived and simulation models are generated automatically. Using these models, the data needed for the training of big data machine-learning algorithms can be generated. We describe the toolchain, already existing components and discuss the possible future implementation.

TI  - A Declarative Approach for Transforming SysML Models to Executable Simulation Models
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Systems Modeling Language (SysML) is an object management group standard for systems-of-systems engineering. It enables the description of complex system models; however, it cannot effectively support all system engineering activities. For instance, system performance evaluation is usually performed via simulation. In this case, the transformation of SysML system models to executable simulation models for specific simulation methodologies and tools is required. Model transformation is a key component for addressing the challenges of seamless integration of SysML model simulation in model-based system engineering. In this paper, we explore a declarative approach, based on the query/view/transformation-relations (QVT-R) standard, for the transformation of SysML models to executable simulation models, fully adhering model-driven architecture (MDA) concepts. It is supported by a framework implemented to provide executable simulation model and code generation. Methodological guidelines, for the effective use of a declarative language as QVT-R, for model transformation, are provided, emphasizing the utilization of existing domain-specific SysML profiles, as well as executable simulation library components. The experience obtained from two different domains, namely, enterprise information and railway transportation systems, modeled as systems-of-systems via SysML, is discussed, based on a quantitative analysis of the respective QVT-R transformations.

CP  - 7th International Software Metrics Symposium
CL  - LONDON, ENGLAND
AB  - Due to increasing demand for software project managers in industry, efforts are needed to develop the management-related knowledge and skills of the current and future software workforce. In particular, university education needs to provide to their computer science students not only technology-related skills but, in addition, a basic understanding of typical phenomena occurring in industrial (and academic) software projects.This paper presents a controlled experiment that evaluates the effectiveness of using a process simulation model for university education in software project management. The experiment uses a pre-test-post-rest control group design with random assignment of computer science students. The treatment of the experimental group involves a System Dynamics simulation model. The treatment of the control group involves a conventional predictive model for project planning, i.e. the well-known COCOMO model.In addition to the presentation of the results of the empirical study, the paper discusses limitations and threats to validity. Proposals for modifications of the experimental design and the treatments are made for future replications.

TI  - GENSIM 2.0: A customizable process simulation model for software process evaluation
T2  - MAKING GLOBALLY DISTRIBUTED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT A SUCCESS STORY
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Software Process
CL  - Leipzig, GERMANY
AB  - Software process analysis and improvement relies heavily on empirical research. Empirical research requires measurement, experimentation, and modeling. Moreover, whatever evidence is gained via empirical research is strongly context dependent. Thus, it is hard to combine results and capitalize upon them in order to improve software development processes in evolving development environments. The process simulation model GENSIM 2.0 addresses these challenges. Compared to existing process simulation models in the literature, the novelty of GENSIM 2.0 is twofold: (1) The model structure is customizable to organization-specific processes. This is achieved by using a limited set of macro-patterns. (2) Model parameters can be easily calibrated to available empirical data and expert knowledge. This is achieved by making the internal model structures explicit and by providing guidance on how to calibrate model parameters. This paper outlines the structure of GENSIM 2.0, shows examples of how to calibrate the simulator to available empirical data, and demonstrates its usefulness through two application scenarios. In those scenarios, GENSIM 2.0 is used to rank feasible combinations of verification and validation (V&V) techniques with regards to their impact on project duration, product quality and resource consumption. Though results confirm the expectation that doing more V&V earlier is generally beneficial to all project performance dimensions, the exact rankings are sensitive to project context.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulation models of the software development process can be used to evaluate potential process changes. Careful evaluation should consider the change within the context of the project environment. While system dynamics models have been used to model the project environment, discrete event and state-based models are more useful when modeling process activities. Hybrid models of the software development process can examine questions that cannot be answered by either system dynamics models or discrete event models alone. In this paper, we present a detailed hybrid model of a software development process currently in use at a major industrial developer. We describe the model and show how the model was used to evaluate simultaneous changes to both the process and the project environment. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Software process simulation modeling: Why? What? How?
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Software process simulation modeling is increasingly being used to address a variety of issues from the strategic management of software development, to supporting process improvements, to software project management training. The scope of software process simulation applications ranges from narrow focused portions of the life cycle to longer term product evolutionary models with broad organizational impacts. This article provides an overview of work being conducted in this field. It identifies the questions and issues that simulation can be used to address ('why'), the scope and variables that can be usefully simulated ('what'), and the modeling approaches and techniques that can be most productively employed ('how'). It includes a summary of the papers in this special issue of the Journal of Systems and Software, which were presented at the First International Silver Falls Workshop on Software Process Simulation Modeling (ProSim'98). It also provides a framework that helps characterize work in this field, and applies this new characterization scheme to many of the articles in this special issue. This paper concludes by offering some guidance in selecting a simulation modeling approach for practical application, and recommending some issues warranting additional research.

AB  - So far, many simulation researches associated with naval ships have been concentrated on the tactical systems and naval ship development. However, studies on the improvement of living conditions for naval ship crews were limited. This study targets a crew mess room which is a typical welfare facility in naval ships and existing modeling and simulation methodologies for naval tactical and strategic systems cannot be applied to the crew room simulations.This paper suggests a simulation modeling framework based on 3-dimensional discrete event simulation methodology for crew mess room congestion assessment and operation scenarios. The simulation modeling framework is verified through practical case simulations. The purpose of simulation modeling framework consists of process and system architecture for operation feasibility tests of welfare facilities in naval ships and is to guide an assessment of the operability performance of a crew mess room.

AB  - A silicon independent C-Based model of the TTP/C protocol was implemented within the EU-founded project FIT The C-based model is, integrated in the C-Sim simulation environment. The main objective of this work is to verify whether the, simulation model of the TTP/C protocol behaves in the presence of faults in the same way as the existing hardware prototype implementation. Thus, the experimental results of the software implemented fault injection applied in the simulation model and in the hardware implementation of the TTP/C network have been compared Fault injection experiments in both the hardware and the simulation model are performed using the same configuration setup, and the same fault injection input parameters (fault injection location, fault type and the fault injection time). The end result comparison has shown a complete conformance of 96.30%, while the cause of the different results was due to hardware specific implementation of the Built-In-Self-Test error detection mechanisms.

AB  - The present paper proposes an innovative system architecture for the safety management of passenger evacuation inside an Airport Terminal, in case of a big indoor fire. The basic idea, in addition to fire hazard pre-assessment, is that information from a fast-predictive simulation of the fire evolution, immediately after the fire starting, could help the airport safety management system in taking sudden decisions to manage very specific fire scenarios. The system is based on an advanced technological interconnection among a simulation model of Fire Safety Engineering, IoT safety and environmental sensors, specific Augmented Reality equipment, and a remote server, able to exchange data by Wi-Fi connections and to elaborate them on a software platform. The ultimate scope of this system is to equip rescuers and airport safety managers with added value AR tools, like AR smart-glasses or tablets, usable for supporting safety decisions and emergency interventions.

TI  - Threat Modeling of Cyber-Physical Systems-A Case Study of a Microgrid System
T2  - COMPUTERS & SECURITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyber threat modeling is an analytical process that is used for identifying the potential threats against a system and supporting the selection of security requirements in the early stages of the system de-velopment life cycle. Thus, threat modeling is a vital instrument for the realization of the secure-by -design principle. Despite being a well-known practice in software development projects, its adaptation to cyber-physical systems still requires systematic elaboration. The complex interactions between cyber and physical spaces and their reflection on the cyber threat landscape constitute a significant challenge for the system development teams. This study proposes a detailed methodology to apply STRIDE to cyber-physical systems and demonstrates its applicability in a case study of a microgrid system. Our method-ology provides a systematic threat elicitation procedure based on an attack taxonomy that was created for this research. This paper also shows how assets could be identified, data flow diagrams formed, trust boundaries determined, and threats prioritized, in the case of a cyber-physical system.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Applying ergonomics within the multi-modelling paradigm with an example from multiple UAV control
T2  - ERGONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a position statement on using ergonomics in conjunction with the multi-modelling paradigm. Multi-modelling is a computational approach to combine models of systems and components for design and simulation of cyber physical systems and systems of systems. Despite potentially significant benefits in terms of more human-centric system modelling, there is limited evidence of the application of ergonomics within multi-modelling. This article presents the case for applying ergonomics within multi-modelling. We open with an introduction to multi-modelling and benefits, applications and gaps for ergonomics in multi-modelling, and of potentially useful models from ergonomics. We then describe a proof-of-concept implementation of ergonomics within a multi-model of UAV control. This demonstrates that as well as user-centred modelling, this approach supports ergonomics in how we can access rich systems models, and the collaborative value of applying ergonomics theory in systems design. Practitioner Summary: Examines multi-modelling, a computational approach for complex modelling, and the contribution of ergonomics. An autonomous UAV test implementation demonstrates the application of ergonomics knowledge for improving design and evaluation processes, and how multi-modelling can give ergonomics access to rich systems models.

TI  - Towards a Software Architecture to Facilitate Multiple Runs of Simulation Models
T2  - MODSIM 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: LAND, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM07)
CL  - Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND
AB  - A variety of techniques in environmental modelling require multiple runs of simulation models. These include for instance uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, using stochastically generated replicate climate inputs, calibration and optimisation, and straight batch running of multiple scenarios. These techniques are in theory applicable to the vast majority of spatial and temporal simulation models in use, and fairly generic tools exist that implement them. Yet the overhead associated with applying these tools to the simulation model at hand is often still significant in practice, with limited prospect for economy of scale.This paper illustrates the architectural considerations to have in order to facilitate these techniques from the ground up in modelling frameworks, while allowing the use of existing analysis tools. One of the aforementioned techniques, uncertainty analysis, is presented and is used as a driver to determine an object oriented architecture for modelling engines, suitable to underpin uncertainty analysis.First, a general conceptual framework for uncertainty estimation of simulation models driven by point time series is presented. This framework does not require knowing the inner workings of the model, and allows for a generalised description of outputs as a random vector with a probability distribution. To illustrate the importance of accounting for uncertainty in decision support, this framework is applied to a simple example of an urban water supply with one reservoir, embodied in a temporal model running at an annual time scale. It demonstrates that the reliability of the water supply is sensitive to the value of the mean annual streamflow, and that the uncertainty of this parameter must be accounted for in the modelling process to avoid an excessively optimistic reliability assessment.The second part of the paper takes this general uncertainty framework and the urban water supply example as a use case. They are analysed, and a summarized design process is presented. The aim of the process is to derive, from the mathematical description of the conceptual framework, an object oriented software architecture for organising simulation models and modelling engines, such that they are more amenable to being subject to uncertainty analysis. To foster a layered design, the design process purposely makes no assumption about the details of how model runs are distributed. This paper concludes with an outline of the computing aspects and the current thinking about how multiple model runs can be parallelised and distributed with different distributed computing tools.

TI  - Architectural reliability analysis of framework-intensive applications: A web service case study
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel methodology for modeling the reliability and performance of web services (WSs) is presented. To present the methodology, an experimental environment is developed in house, where WSs are treated as atomic entities but the underlying middleware is partitioned into layers. WSs are deployed in JBoss AS. Web service requests are generated to a remote middleware on which JBoss runs, and important performance parameters under various configurations are collected. In addition, a modularized simulation model in Petri net is developed from the architecture of the middleware and run-time behavior of the WSs. The results show that (1) the simulation model provides for measuring the performance and reliability of WSs under different loads and conditions that may be of great interest to WS designers and the professionals involved; (2) configuration parameters have substantial impact on the overall performance; (3) the simulation model provides a basis for aggregating the modules (layers), nullifying modules, or to include additional aspects of the WS architecture; and (4) the model is beneficial to predict the performance of WSs for those cases that are difficult to replicate in a field study.

AB  - To develop state-of-the-art cyber physical systems (CPS), today's engineers need to possess both technical and social skills Technical skills are crucial to master the complexity of products and systems integrating hardware, software and some kinds of communication mechanism with the physical world. Excellent social skills are the key success factor for CPS development projects that usually run within multidisciplinary and multicultural teams. Ideally, students need to gather experience in practical projects focusing on up-to-date topics. In this work we describe a novel task-centric holistic agile teaching approach (T-CHAT) for teaching CPS-engineering in realistic industry-like scenario. We present the implementation of this approach and discuss the evaluation results based on the students' feedback.

TI  - Effective software project management education through simulation models:: An externally replicated experiment
T2  - PRODUCT FOCUSED SOFTWARE PROCESS IMPROVEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 5th International Conference on Product Focused Software Process Improvement
CL  - Kansai Sci City, JAPAN
AB  - It is an undeniable fact that software project managers need reliable techniques and robust tool support to be able to exercise a fine control over the development process so that products can be delivered in time and within budget. Therefore, managers need to be trained so that they could learn and use new techniques and be aware of their possible impacts. In this context, effective learning is an issue. A small number of empirical studies have been carried out to study the impact of software engineering education. One such study is by Pfahl et al [11] in which they have performed a controlled experiment to evaluate the learning effectiveness of using a process simulation model for educating computer science students in software project management. The experimental group applied a Systems Dynamics simulation model while the control group used the COCOMO model as a predictive tool for project planning. The results indicated that students using the simulation model gain a better understanding about typical behaviour patterns of software development projects. Experiments need to be externally replicated to both verify and generalise original results. In this paper, we will discuss an externally replicated experiment in which we keep the design and the goal of the above experiment intact. We then analyse our results in relation to the original experiment and another externally replicated experiment, discussed in [12].

AB  - It would be strategically advantageous to organisations if they could predict the behaviour of new systems meant to replace existing legacy ones. In fact, such organisations could tackle possible performance problems of the new systems before they become operational. This paper describes how CAPPLES, a capacity planning and performance analysis method for the migration of legacy systems, can be used to predict such behaviour. The paper describes the process of constructing, validating and deploying a simulation model using CAPPLES. Peculiarities of the legacy system migration that affect the simulation process are presented through the use of a case study.

TI  - Dynamic simulation modeling of an inspection-based software lifecycle process
T2  - SIMULATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A dynamic simulation model of an inspection-based software lifecycle process has been developed to support quantitative process evaluation. It can be used in project planning and management, and aid in process improvement. The model serves to examine the effects of inspection practices on cost, schedule, and quality throughout the lifecycle. It uses system dynamics to model the interrelated flows of tasks, errors, and personnel throughout different development phases and is calibrated to industrial data. It demonstrates the effects of performing inspections and other managerial policies. The dynamic effects are tracked throughout the time history of a project to show resource usage, task completions and defect trends per phase. Cumulative metrics and development tradeoffs for decision making are also presented. Several types of validation tests are performed against industrial data, existing theory and other prediction models. The results indicate a valid model that can be used for process evaluation and project planning, and serve as a framework for incorporating other dynamic process factors.

M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional safety analysis techniques have shown difficulties in incorporating dynamically changing structures of CPSs (Cyber-Physical Systems). STPA (System-Theoretic Process Analysis), one of the widely used, needs to unfold and arrange all hidden structures before beginning a full-fledged analysis. This paper proposes an intermediate model "Information Unfolding Model (IUM)" and a process "Information Unfolding Process (IUP)" to unfold dynamic structures which are hidden in CPSs and so help analysts construct control structures in STPA thoroughly.

M3  - Article
AB  - A computer simulation model demonstrating the effect of directional selection upon a simplified quantitative genetic character, is presented. Complementary homozygous parents were crossed to generate a fully heterozygous F1 population. Phenotypic truncation selection was effected upon the F2 and subsequent generations, and genotypic and phenotypic response to selection, as well as the change in population heterozygosity, was monitored to generation F9.  The model simulates selection for alternative breeding regimes, modes of allelic interaction, selection pressure, population size and levels of environmental variation.  Three alternative methods for the simulation of the environmental component of phenotypic variance are incorporated, and mechanisms and relative merits of the rival methods are discussed. Data generated by the model conformed closely to theoretical expectation, lending support to the use of the model as a platform for development of more comprehensive simulation models. Potential improvements to the model are discussed.

AB  - Recent years have seen an increasing interest in understanding and analyzing cyber-physical system (CPS) models and their development tools. Existing work in this area is limited by the lack of an open corpus of CPS models, which we aim to address by building the by-far largest curated corpus of CPS artifacts. Next, to address the safety-critical aspect of CPS development tools, we discuss the design and evaluation of the very first differential testing framework for arbitrary CPS tool chain. We identify challenges unique to commercial CPS tool chain testing and present a tool implementation which has already found 9 new, confirmed bugs in Simulink, the most widely used CPS development tool.

TI  - Performance Analysis of Embedded Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Networks on Smart Cyber-Physical Systems for IoT Environments
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, modern society is experiencing a significant transformation. Thanks to the digitization of society and manufacturing, mainly because of a combination of technologies, such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, machine learning, smart cyber-physical systems, etc., which are making the smart factory and Industry 4.0 a reality. Currently, most of the intelligence of smart cyber-physical systems is implemented in software. For this reason, in this work, we focused on the artificial intelligence software design of this technology, one of the most complex and critical. This research aimed to study and compare the performance of a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network designed for solving the problem of character recognition in three implementation technologies: personal computers, cloud computing environments, and smart cyber-physical systems. After training and testing the multilayer perceptron, training time and accuracy tests showed each technology has particular characteristics and performance. Nevertheless, the three technologies have a similar performance of 97% accuracy, despite a difference in the training time. The results show that the artificial intelligence embedded in fog technology is a promising alternative for developing smart cyber-physical systems.

M3  - Article
AB  - Cyber-physical systems are becoming more intelligent with the adoption of heterogeneous sensor networks and machine learning capabilities that deal with an increasing amount of input data. While this complexity aims to solve problems in various domains, it adds new challenges for the system assurance. One issue is the rise in the number of abnormal behaviors that affect system performance due to possible sensor faults and attacks. The combination of safety risks, which are usually caused by random sensor faults and security risks that can happen during any random system state, makes the full coverage testing of the cyber-physical system challenging. Existing techniques are inadequate to deal with complex safety and security co-risks against cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we propose AST-SafeSec, an analysis methodology for both safety and security aspects that utilizes reinforcement learning to identify the most likely adversarial paths at various normal or failure states of a cyber-physical system that can influence system behavior through its sensor data. The methodology is evaluated using an autonomous vehicle scenario by incorporating a security attack into the stochastic sensor elements of a vehicle. Evaluation results show that the methodology analyzes the interaction of malicious attacks with random faults and identifies the incident caused by the interactions and the most likely path that leads to the incident.

Various design and reconfiguration alternatives have to be considered and evaluated through indicators such as: On Time Delivery (OTD) within the plant, number of material shortages or product waiting time, etc. Due to the dynamic behavior of MHS, simulation-based approaches play an essential role in such analysis. However, developing simulation models for MHS can be time-consuming (especially for modeling Large Scale Systems) and difficult to build (some skills and knowledge are required to use simulation software). To overcome these challenges, data-driven approaches have been proposed in the literature for the generation of MHS simulation models. Nevertheless, the available approaches focus on specific domains and may not always account for all the necessary data, including MHS control policies. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a framework that employs a data catalog regrouping five data categories (layout, product features, production process, material handling process, and MHS control methods) to support the generation of MHS simulation models using SIMIO. The article details the data structure used to gather MHS simulation data, the selection of a simulation tool, the modeling patterns integrated into the simulations, and the application of the transformation rules. The whole approach is implemented to form the generation framework. The framework is designed to assist decision-makers (who have basic simulation knowledge) in the evaluation of MHS design/reconfiguration alternatives. The paper finally presents a validation of the framework on two case studies.

TI  - Empirical analysis in software process simulation modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Software process simulation modeling is increasingly being used to address a variety of issues from the strategic management of software development, to supporting process improvements, to software project management training. The scope of software process simulation applications ranges from narrow focused portions of the life cycle to longer-term product evolutionary models with broad organizational impacts. This paper discusses some of the important empirical issues that arise in software process simulation modeling. We first address issues concerning real-world data used to (1) establish input parameters to a software process simulation model, and (2) establish actual organizational results against which the model's results (i.e., outputs) will be compared. On the input side, the challenges include small sample sizes, considerable variability and outliers, lack of desired data, loosely defined metrics, and so forth. On the output side, the paper addresses (1) verification and validation of the model, and (2) quantitative approaches to evaluating model outputs in support of managerial decision making including financial performance using Net Present Value (NPV), multi-criteria utility functions, and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The paper focuses on the stochastic modeling using Monte Carlo simulation. The paper is grounded in the authors' practical application experiences, and major points are illuminated by examples drawn from that field work. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cyber-physical systems interact closely at runtime with their operational context, i.e., other systems, users, and external entities. Therefore, eliciting and documenting interactions with the operational context allows documenting rationales for design decisions, which is essential to define a system architecture that suits the system's purpose. For cyber-physical systems acting in system networks, this task becomes challenging since these networks can change at runtime, because individual systems can leave or join a network spontaneously. Hence, it becomes impossible to predict at design time the operational contexts at runtime. To aid context analysis and specification of such systems, this paper contributes a solution approach where the context of a system is not defined based on a static system boundary but depends on the specific intended use. We propose a view-centric perception of the operational context to leverage the functionality of external systems. This allows differentiating between functionality offered by the cyber-physical system network as a whole and the functionality provided by each individual system. An evaluation with an industrial case example and industry collaboration shows that this approach allows making suitable assumptions of the operational context at design time to guide architecture decisions.

TI  - Hierarchical Data Fusion-Based Health State Assessment of Nuclear Power Plant Operation Under Human-Cyber-Physical System Architecture
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-cyber-physical system has emerged as a pivotal tool for intelligent production throughout the whole lifecycle. In this paper, a health state assessment approach based on hierarchical data fusion is proposed under human-cyber-physical system architecture. The human-cyber-physical system emphasizes the flexibility of dynamic operating states and the evolvability of the enabling models. First of all, a multiple hierarchy consisting of equipment, systems and function is established as a physical basis for human-cyber-physical system. Regarding the equipment-level assessment characterized by extensive input parameters, a dynamic weighting method is exploited to highlight the abnormal parameters. Thus, the degraded device can be significantly reflected in the system-level assessment by fusing equipment parameters. To evaluate the operation function of a plant, a Nearest Class Mean classifiers-based Random Forests algorithm is explored considering the small-scale and imbalanced instances in different health levels. However, the conventional fixed and changeable models threaten the accuracy and rationality of the human-cyber-physical system. We introduce incremental learning to reform Random Forests that can update promptly with new data and knowledge. Finally, the proposed scheme and technologies are applied in a nuclear power plant to demonstrate their effectiveness.Note to Practitioners-The modern production desires to be further intelligent for improvement of economic benefits but with the consistent requirements of high safety and reliability. The trades-off between efficiency and safety bring the greater challenges to the operation and maintenance for production. This paper proposes an evolvable human-cyber-physical system scheme that not only integrates more intelligent elements but also attaches some solution to the abovementioned problem. The scheme is implemented on the multi-hierarchy health states assessment which is the core in production maintenance against lagging. This equipment-system-function fusion and assessment provide a unified platform for multi-departments to collaborate and self-manage. The novel weighting method abandons the conventional subjective evaluation criteria with high time consumption. Computers are convenient to possess sensing data efficiently and highlight the anomaly obviously. In particular, it is mentioned that the intelligent models in human-cyber-physical systems are always fixed and unable to alter with the physical system changes. Incremental learning, a promising branch of machine learning, is introduced to reform the assessment model to be stainable developed with new data adding. The scheme takes a nuclear plant as example because it is more corresponding to these issues. The future studies can extend the scheme to other scenarios.

TI  - Predicting Resilience of Interdependent Urban Infrastructure Systems
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is increasing the frequency and the intensity of weather events, leading to large-scale disruptions to critical infrastructure systems. The high level of interdependence among these systems further aggravates the extent of disruptions. To mitigate these impacts, models and methods are needed to support rapid decision-making for optimal resource allocation in the aftermath of a disruption and to substantiate investment decisions for the structural reconfiguration of these systems. In this paper, we leverage infrastructure simulation models and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to develop resilience prediction models. First, we employ an interdependent infrastructure simulation model to generate infrastructure disruption and recovery scenarios and compute the resilience value for each scenario. The infrastructure-, disruption-, and recovery-related attributes are recorded for each scenario and ML algorithms are employed on the synthetic dataset to develop accurate resilience prediction models. The results of the prediction models are analyzed and possible design strategies suggested based on the resilience enhancement attributes. The proposed methodology can support infrastructure agencies in the resource-allocation process for pre- and post-disaster interventions.

AB  - Typical education in management of software projects lacks practical experience. But experience is essential in under-standing the problems and especially their solutions. A real software project is difficult to practice because of its long duration and the potential of high damage if the project fails. Simulation games in a sandbox are a well-known approach for practicing complex content. But the design and development of such a game needs much knowledge about all the relevant processes that should be simulated. In this paper, we propose a general framework and a method that can be used for developing project management simulation games for an educational purpose in the software engineering domain. We developed a general simulation model including aspects of ergonomic analysis, work psychology, learning theory and software engineering. With this, we are able to simulate not only the working processes but also the character of the developers. It can be used without understanding the simulation model, so there is no need to understand all the complex content behind. Considering existing solutions, our approach supports different types of games, without making limitations to the game design. We show that with adequate abstraction there is no need to develop an own simulation model for each simulation game. Instead, all relevant aspects can be integrated in a general simulation model.

TI  - Equipment remaining useful life prediction oriented symbiotic simulation driven by real-time degradation data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODELING SIMULATION AND SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an emerging simulation technology in the field of system modeling and simulation, the equipment symbiotic simulation has become research emphasis. In the field of equipment maintenance support, the outstanding problem of equipment remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is analyzed, i.e., the stable model parameters without self-evolution ability, which has become the primary factor that hinders self-adaptive prediction of equipment RUL. Combined with parallel systems theory, the equipment RUL prediction oriented symbiotic simulation framework is proposed on the basis of modeling analysis and Wiener state space model (SSM) is taken as the basic simulation model in the framework. Driven by the dynamic injected equipment degradation observation data, the model parameters are updated online by using expectation maximum (EM) algorithm and the data assimilation between simulation outputs and observation data is executed by using Kalman filter, so as to realize dynamic evolution of the simulation model. The simulation model evolution which makes the simulation outputs close to equipment real degradation state provides high fidelity model and data for predicting equipment RUL accurately. The framework is verified by the performance degradation data of a bearing. The simulation results show that the symbiotic simulation method can accurately simulate the equipment performance degradation process and the self-adaptive prediction of equipment RUL is realized on the basis of improving prediction accuracy, proving the feasibility and effectiveness of symbiotic simulation method.

TI  - Testing self-healing cyber-physical systems under uncertainty: a fragility-oriented approach
T2  - SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - As an essential feature of smart cyber-physical systems (CPSs), self-healing behaviors play a major role in maintaining the normality of CPSs in the presence of faults and uncertainties. It is important to test whether self-healing behaviors can correctly heal faults under uncertainties to ensure their reliability. However, the autonomy of self-healing behaviors and impact of uncertainties make it challenging to conduct such testing. To this end, we devise a fragility-oriented testing approach, which is comprised of two novel algorithms: fragility-oriented testing (FOT) and uncertainty policy optimization (UPO). The two algorithms utilize the fragility, obtained from test executions, to learn the optimal policies for invoking operations and introducing uncertainties, respectively, to effectively detect faults. We evaluated their performance by comparing them against a coverage-oriented testing (COT) algorithm and a random uncertainty generation method (R). The evaluation results showed that the fault detection ability of FOT+UPO was significantly higher than the ones of FOT+R, COT+UPO, and COT+R, in 73 out of 81 cases. In the 73 cases, FOT+UPO detected more than 70% of faults, while the others detected 17% of faults, at the most.

TI  - A Study on Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment Based on the "Asset Container " Method and CWSS
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, legislation and standardization of cyber security management for cyber-physical systems such as automotive systems have been progressing steadily. ISO/SAE 21434, published in 2021, addresses the management and analysis of electrical systems within road vehicles from a cybersecurity perspective. It also recommends some methods for the threat analysis and risk assessment (TARA) process. However, there are two problems in the evaluation methods derived from conventional security analysis approaches. One problem is related to the insufficient evaluation of attack feasibilities for cyber-physical systems by the CVSS-based approach. Another problem is the unclear relationship between damage factors in analyzing the impact of damage to each asset. In this paper, we focus on the TARA process, and apply an "asset container " method for threat classification, proposed by the authors at DECSoS 2017, and a CWSS-based risk quantification method. Moreover, we can also add some perspective to improve risk evaluation suitable for automotive systems. Following our past studies on methodologies to evaluate the risk of such special cyber-physical systems, we can quantify risks limited to some cyber-physical systems, such as direct access attacks to in-vehicle networks.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE-EVOLUTION AND PROCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The process of engineering cyber-physical systems (CPS) is inevitably challenging because of the intrinsic problem of merging the specification of different ensembles that indicate hardware, software, and physical aspects of such systems. This intrinsic complexity is exacerbated when modelling and analysing the performance characteristics of CPS since multiple models need to coexist in order to get meaningful performance indicators. In this paper, we present a case study, a delivery robots system, whose experience is exploited towards building a guided process for engineering CPS through performance-based modelling and analysis. Model-based performance results are provided while analysing different design alternatives, thus to support architects in the process of better understanding the performance characteristics of CPS under development.

AB  - In this paper, we describe the software design framework and simulation model for agricultural machinery driving training based on serious game. The traditional driving training depends on the real machinery, which always results in high training cost, low efficiency and safety accident. To solve the above problems, a new training framework is realized by expressing the complex driving instruction as linked list and EBNF. By comparison among linear interpolation, parabolic interpolation and Lagrange interpolation method, a succinct high-efficient machine simulation model is constructed. Then a serious game for agricultural machinery driving training based on these models is developed. In this game, we make use of the latest Unity3d engine to generate a living virtual environment for learners to get familiar with agricultural machinery knowledge and basic operation techniques. Due to the low requirement of hardware, the serious game will help to decrease training expenses greatly and alleviate the current problems of agricultural machinery driving training.

CP  - 18th International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS)

AB  - To reduce the cost and risk of the development of system of systems (SoS) by pre-evaluation before the SoS is built, a model-driven approach is proposed to evaluate the SoS based on its architecture, especially focused on measures of performance and effectiveness. In order to implement the pre-evaluation, the system architecture needs to be transformed to the simulation model of the system under the directing of the evaluation requirement model, then the evaluation can be done based on the evaluation model and the data from simulation. The architecture, evaluation requirement model, simulation model and evaluation model involved in the above process constitute the model system (a set of models related with each other) of our approach. Through the modeling activities based on the model system, we can implement the systematically pre-evaluation of SoS. The model system and its meta-model, which are the core of our approach, are detailed after the introduction of the framework of our approach. Then the transformations from DoDAF architecture to evaluation requirement model and simulation model are studied for accelerating the evaluation process. The case study shows that our approach can not only ensure the standardization and systematization of the evaluating process, but can improve the evaluating efficiency and creditability based on the proposed transformation method.

M3  - Article
AB  - Avatar actions can be captured using certain gesture sensors or can be predefined by game designers through desktop applications. In other words, developing an online avatar editor could be necessary to specify the detailed actions for use by people who are not game creators. Our research team proposed a web-based toolset, myKLA, to construct and design avatar actions with editor and player features. The goal of myKLA is to help users define the required behaviors of avatars within a set time frame without codes. We used cyber-physical system theory in a software reconstruction initiative. Additionally, an exchangeable JSON file format for predefining the avatar actions was opened and shared here. Furthermore, the cyclomatic complexity of the main code blocks in our toolset was measured and changed using the McCabe approach to fine-tune the performance. An algorithm was proposed for quickly calculating an integrated activity diagram from several sub-activity diagrams. Our research showed that it is easy to create an avatar head and embed it in other web-based applications for additional interaction utilization. Therefore, our findings will be useful in creating and designing new educational tools.

TI  - Statistical Approach to Architecture Modes in Smart Cyber Physical Systems

AB  - Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (sCPS) are complex distributed decentralized systems of cooperating components. They typically operate in uncertain environments and thus require means for managing variability at run-time. Architectural modes have traditionally been a proven means for the runtime variability. They are easy to understand, easy to realize in resource-constrained systems and (contrary to more sophisticated methods of learning) provide an explicit specification that can be inspected and validated at design time. However, in uncertain environments (which is the case of sCPS), they tend to lack expressivity to take into account the level of uncertainty and factor it in the mode-switching logic. In this paper we present a rich language to specify mode-switch guards. The semantics of the language is based on statistical tests, which, as we show, is a convenient way to reason about uncertainty in the state of the environment.

AB  - A general framework is proposed for cyber-physical system reliability modeling and evaluation considering some typical cyber attacks. The impacts of attacks from cyber space on physical space are analyzed, including the denial of service attack and deception attack. The cyber intrusion is modeled by a semi-Markov process, which decides the occurrence probability of cyber-attacks. The occurrence probability is related to the attacker level and defender level, therefore the cyber intrusion process is more practical and applicable for most attack situations. A case study on industrial heat exchanger system is provided to quantify the influences of cyber attacks on system performance and reliability. Some important conclusions are also drawn, which will be useful in designing resilient cyber-physical systems.

TI  - Convolutional Neural Network Formulation to Compare 4-D Seismic and Reservoir Simulation Models
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a novel approach based on Deep Learning methods using a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to compare observed four-dimensional (4-D) seismic data with reservoir simulation model results and select the simulation models with the best match. Our approach advantages are twofold: 1) it is not a pixel-based approach, as it learns spatial features through training examples and 2) it does not require the simulation model and 4-D seismic maps to be in the same domain, enabling a direct comparison of maps in the seismic domain with maps in the numerical simulation domain. Additionally, we present a new methodology to quantitatively assess the performance of each method relative to the expected results. For this purpose, we build an annotated dataset containing the maps that best match the 4-D seismic in different realistic scenarios while taking into account the specialists' knowledge. We apply our methodology to evaluate if a method is able to perform according to what specialists expect, considering the annotated data. We also propose an improvement to traditional methods using a statistical method to convert maps of different physical properties into a common property, which can be used as an alternative to avoid forward and/or inversion procedures commonly used to bring 4-D seismic and simulation data to the same domain. Finally, we present an extensive comparison, qualitative and quantitative, of our approaches with other methods in the literature, such as the traditional pixelwise strategy for maps in the same domain, and methods based on binarization of maps in different domains. The results show that our proposed methods are capable of more accurately identifying the best-matched models, according to the specialists' answers.

AB  - The modeling and analysis of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) is inevitably challenging due to the intrinsic problem of merging the specification of different ensembles that indicate hardware, software and physical aspects of such systems. This intrinsic complexity is exacerbated in performance engineering since multiple models need to co-exist in order to get meaningful performance indicators. In this paper we introduce a guided process called IMPACt (multi Modelling PerformAnce Cps),which helps architects during the design phase, to better understand the behavior of the system under development and the design choices they made, through performance analysis on results obtained by runnable models derived from system high-level specification.

TI  - Assessing the Cost Effectiveness of Fault Prediction in Acceptance Testing
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Until now, various techniques for predicting fault-prone modules have been proposed and evaluated in terms of their prediction performance; however, their actual contribution to business objectives such as quality improvement and cost reduction has rarely been assessed. This paper proposes using a simulation model of software testing to assess the cost effectiveness of test effort allocation strategies based on fault prediction results. The simulation model estimates the number of discoverable faults with respect to the given test resources, the resource allocation strategy, a set of modules to be tested, and the fault prediction results. In a case study applying fault prediction of a small system to acceptance testing in the telecommunication industry, results from our simulation model showed that the best strategy was to let the test effort be proportional to "the number of expected faults in a module x log(module size)." By using this strategy with our best fault prediction model, the test effort could be reduced by 25 percent while still detecting as many faults as were normally discovered in testing, although the company required about 6 percent of the test effort for metrics collection, data cleansing, and modeling. The simulation results also indicate that the lower bound of acceptable prediction accuracy is around 0.78 in terms of an effort-aware measure, Norm(P-opt). The results indicate that reduction of the test effort can be achieved by fault prediction only if the appropriate test strategy is employed with high enough fault prediction accuracy. Based on these preliminary results, we expect further research to assess their general validity with larger systems.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Decision support for planning and improving software development projects is a crucial success factor. The special characteristics of software development aggregate these tasks in contrast to the planning of many other processes, such as production processes. Process simulation can be used to support decisions on process alternatives on the basis of existing knowledge. Thereby, new development knowledge can be gained faster and more cost effective.This chapter gives a short introduction to experimental software engineering, describes simulation approaches within that area, and introduces a method for systematically developing discrete-event software process simulation models. Advanced simulation modeling techniques will point out key problems and possible solutions, including the use of visualization techniques for better simulation result interpretation.

AB  - Identifying performance problems in modern software systems is nontrivial, even more so when looking at specific application domains, such as cyber-physical systems. The heterogeneity of software and hardware components makes the process of performance evaluation more challenging, and traditional software performance engineering techniques may fail while dealing with interacting and heterogeneous components. The goal of this paper is to introduce a model-based approach to understand software performance problems in cyber-physical systems. In our previous work, we listed some common bad practices, namely software performance antipatterns, that may occur. Here we are interested in shedding light on these antipatterns by means of performance models, i.e., queuing network models, that provide evidence of how antipatterns may affect the overall system performance. Starting from the specification of three software performance antipatterns tailored for cyber-physical systems, we provide the queuing network models capturing the corresponding bad practices. The analysis of these models demonstrates their usefulness in recognizing performance problems early in the software development process. This way, performance engineers are supported in the task of detecting and fixing the performance criticalities.

TI  - Using simulation to aid decision making in managing the usability evaluation process
T2  - INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: This paper is developed in the context of Usability Engineering. More specifically, it focuses on the use of modelling and simulation to help decision-making in the scope of usability evaluation.Objective: The main goal of this paper is to present UESim: a System Dynamics simulation model to help decision-making in the make-up of the usability evaluation team during the process of usability evaluation.Method: To develop this research we followed four main research phases: (a) study identification, (b) study development, (c) running and observation and finally, (d) reflexion. In relation with these phases the paper describes the literature revision, the model building and validation, the model simulation and its results and finally the reflexion on it.Results: We developed and validated a model to simulate the usability evaluation process. Through three different simulations we analysed the effects of different compositions of the evaluation team on the outcome of the evaluation. The simulation results show the utility of the model in the decision making of the usability evaluation process by changing the number and expertise of evaluators employed.Conclusion: One of the main advantages of using such a simulation model is that it allows developers to observe the evolution of the key indicators of the evaluation process over time. UESim represents a customisable tool to help decision-making in the management of the usability evaluation process, since it makes it possible to analyse how the key process indicators are affected by the main management options of the Usability Evaluation Process.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the case of kidney transplantations, there is always a serious imbalance between the number of kidneys donated for transplantation and the number of persons wishing to receive a transplant. This not only affects the quality of life of those unable to obtain a transplant, but it also has important repercussions on the treatment of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) by transplantation and dialysis. Also there are a number of ways in which the kidney transplantation can be achieved, such as the cadaveric kidney transplantation, live donor kidney transplantation, kidney paired donation and list exchange. A simulation study of all the referred programmes is performed using simulation models developed for each programme to obtain the better estimate of the average waiting time of a patient per year. With the estimates given by the simulation models, the best serving programme for each blood type patient is selected, declared and recommended.

It is not obvious how to teach their combination while respecting individual challenges posed to students and educators. We have devised a software project class for teaching the agile MDE for CPS. The project class was held in three different semesters. In this paper, we report on the setup of our exploratory study and its goals for teaching. We base our evaluation and insights on interviews and questionnaires. Our results show the feasibility of combination of agile MDE for CPS but also the challenges this combination poses to students and educators.

TI  - Experimentation with dynamic simulation models in software engineering: planning and reporting guidelines
T2  - EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulation-based studies (SBS) have become an interesting investigation approach for Software Engineering (SE). However, the reports on experiments with dynamic simulation models found in the technical literature lack relevant information, hampering the full understanding of the procedures and results reported, as well as their replicability. Apart from the limitations on the length in conferences and journal papers, some of the relevant information seems to be missing due to methodological issues not considered when conducting such studies. This is the case of missing research questions and goals, lack of evidence regarding the dynamic simulation model validity, poorly designed simulation experiments, amongst others. Based on findings from a previous quasi-systematic literature review, we propose a set of reporting guidelines for SBS with dynamic models in the context of SE aiming at providing guidance on which information the report should contain. Furthermore, these guidelines were evolved to support SBS planning by identifying potential threats to simulation study validity and in making recommendations to avoid them, through qualitative analysis and external evaluation. Finally, we conducted different evaluations regarding both the reporting and planning guidelines, apart from using them to support the planning of a SBS as regards software evolution. A set of 33 reporting and planning guidelines for different stages of the simulation lifecycle and focused on the experimentation with dynamic simulation models have been put together. The first assessments point to a comprehensive set of guidelines, supporting a comprehensive preparation and review of the plans and reports from the studies, apart from the planning of a SBS focused on software evolution, potentially reducing the threats to the experimentation with the validity of dynamic simulation models. The 33 guidelines cannot be understood as separate groups for reporting and planning as they overlap in many aspects. The main goal is to use the guidelines to support the planning of a simulation-based study with dynamic models so that experimenters may identify potential threats to validity and produce relevant information for a complete simulation experiment report in advance. Despite their initial contribution to increase the validity of SBS, the reporting and planning of simulation-based experiments with dynamic models still has to be discussed and improved in SE. Therefore, additional assessments of this set of guidelines are needed to strengthen the confidence in their completeness and usefulness.

The question that we address is how to predict future vulnerability discoveries. Among important factors we can consider various changes in the user environment. Existing vulnerability discovery models (VDM) take them into account only partly. We have developed an agent based simulation model which considers additional relevant factors from the user environment that affect the discovery process.

T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) is an open and standardized automotive software architecture, developed by automobile manufacturers, suppliers, and tool developers. Its design is a direct consequence of the increasingly important role played by software in vehicles. As design choices during the software deployment phase have a large impact on the behavior of the system, designers need to explore various trade-offs. Examples of such design choices are the mapping of software components to processors, the priorities of tasks and messages, and buffer allocation. In this paper, we evaluate the appropriateness of DEVS, the Discrete-Event System specification, for modeling and subsequent performance evaluation of AUTOSAR-based systems. Moreover, a DEVS simulation model is constructed for AUTOSAR-based electronic control units connected by a communication bus. To aid developers in evaluating a deployment solution, the simulation model is extended with co-simulation with a plant and environment model, evaluation at different levels of detail, and fault injection. Finally, we examine how the simulation model supports the relationship between the supplier and the original equipment manufacturer in the automotive industry. We demonstrate and validate our work by means of a power window case study.

AB  - This paper presents a model-based approach to generate configurable software architectures of so called Cloud-based Cyber-Physical Systems (CCPS). Cloud computing makes dynamically scalable computing power and data storage available. These advantages are included in the design of Cloud-based Cyber-Physical Systems. The designed platform architecture is evaluated by two scenarios of automation engineering. The different scenarios of camera-based process monitoring are analyzed and subject of a timing analysis, an energy consumption estimation as well as a cost analysis. Significant improvements concerning processing time are shown and the energy optimal solution is identified. Moreover the most cost-effective solution is highlighted.

TI  - Extending the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel for architecture-driven simulation modernization
T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid improvement of hardware, the constant evaluation of simulation development methodologies and environments has brought us a new challenge: simulations modernization. This paper presents a simulation knowledge discovery metamodel that extends the Object Management Group's knowledge discovery metamodel by adding a simulation model package for enabling architecture-driven simulation modernization. While there are some endeavors that propose integration methods, modernization of legacy simulations has not been investigated. Architecture-driven modernization has been introduced as a process of comprehending and transforming existing software assets. It advocates a model-based approach to software modernization in which the knowledge extracted from software assets is captured in models that conform to a metamodel, namely the knowledge discovery metamodel. It specifies an ontology of software assets. Model transformations are then recommended as means of modernization of legacy assets. But diversity in methodologies and approaches to specify simulation modeling assets prohibits the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel from providing adequate meta definitions to capture knowledge in simulations. System Entity Structure has long been used for knowledge representation by the simulation community. It provides formalism for composition, taxonomy and coupling relations. Hence, System Entity Structure is proposed as an intermediate metamodel to capture the meta-constructs and their relations. It is then made available to define particular metamodels for particular simulation modeling methodologies or approaches. The promoted methodology is exercised with samples in order to collect evidence of its applicability. Metamodel segments are presented for knowledge discovery for discrete event systems specification and Modelica simulation programming language. A complete metamodel is then introduced for the real-time distributed simulation domain model of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Institute of Flight Systems. Finally, this metamodel is used to introduce discovery artifacts. These samples provide valuable indications that the methodology works.

TI  - A framework for improving the requirements engineering process management
T2  - SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a system dynamics model for improving the requirements engineering process management. The paper argues that improving RE process management improves the quality of the specification produced. It uses a simulation modelling approach to capture the complex and dynamic nature of quality and also the cost of resources and time needed to complete the process. Current claims by various researchers and empirical evidence has led to our proposition that "the earlier in the requirements engineering phase that system dynamics simulation modelling is used, the more effective the RE process management is and the better its product quality will be." In developing such a model, the paper fills an important gap in the RE process management literature and has potential to provide requirement engineers, managers and software development organisations with a model-based process framework to aid quality assessment and improvement. The paper concludes by suggesting that the framework makes a useful contribution both in providing the foundations for theory building in RE process management and quality improvement by aiding shared understanding through learning and training situations.

TI  - Software process simulation to achieve higher CMM levels
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Organizations interested in improving their process performance face two key questions:What is the best approach for making decisions about process changes?How can the risk associated with potential process alternatives be assessed?Quantitative process analysis tools are being developed by Northrop Grumman's Surveillance and Battle Management Systems (SBMS Melbourne, Florida) and Portland State University, under sponsorship of the Software Engineering Research Center (SERC). These tools consist of stochastic simulation models of the software development process. The stochastic/analytic portions of the models provide a quantitative understanding of the current process and provide a mechanism for the quantitative analysis of proposed process change alternatives prior to implementation. The use of simulation models also supports a quantitative assessment of risk or uncertainty associated with process change alternatives. For Northrop Grumman's SBMS Melbourne site, the use of software process simulation is a key part of the company's strategy for achieving a higher software development process capability and moving to Levels 4 and 5 of the Capability Maturity Model (CMM)(TM).(3) This paper provides a brief background on alternative quantitative approaches, describes the model currently being utilized by the SBMS Melbourne site, and provides an example of its use in analyzing a potential process change.

TI  - Reliability evaluation of Markov cyber-physical system oriented to cognition of equipment operating status
T2  - COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of computing, communication, and control technologies, cyber-physical systems that integrate physical space, information space, and social space have emerged and are widely used in various important infrastructures. This article introduces the composition and basic algorithm of the hidden Markov model, and gives the mathematical description of the hidden Markov model. Since the hidden Markov model can deduce the hidden state of the observation object through the observed feature values, a device operating state cognition scheme based on the hidden Markov model is proposed. A method for analyzing cascading failures is proposed, and the critical threshold value of cyber-physical system under random attack is obtained. It is verified by simulation experiments, and the changes of system critical thresholds under different network parameters are compared and analyzed. We mainly use several sets of simulation experiments to verify the reliability of the critical threshold, and then verify near the critical threshold. Before simulating the cascading failure process, we first construct two random networks based on the average degree and the number of nodes. According to the previous description of the cyber-physical system model, a node in network B is randomly connected with three nodes in network A, so that the two networks are connected together to form a coupled system. Random attack or failure is represented by randomly deleting nodes. In the simulation experiment, we will simulate the process of cascading failure at each step, and after each step of cascading failure, we output and save the number of remaining nodes. When no nodes in the two networks are deleted, the cascading failure will stop, and then we will verify the critical threshold through the data obtained from the analysis. This provides the support of related theories and methods for the design of stable and reliable cyber-physical systems.

TI  - A CBT module with integrated simulation component for software project management education and training
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to increasing demand for software project managers in industry, efforts are needed to develop the management-related knowledge and skills of the current and future software workforce. In particular, university education needs to provide to their computer science and software engineering (SE) students not only technology-related skills but, in addition, a basic understanding of typical phenomena occurring in industrial (and academic) software projects. The objective of this paper is to present concepts of a computer-based training (CBT) module for student education in software project management. The single-learner CBT module can be run using standard web-browsers (e.g. Netscape). The simulation component of the CBT module is implemented using the system dynamics (SD) simulation modelling method. The paper presents the design of the simulation model and the training scenario offered by the existing CBT module prototype. Possibilities for empirical validation of the effectiveness of the CBT module in university education are described, results of a first controlled experiment are presented and discussed, and future extensions of the CBT module towards collaborative learning environments are suggested.

AB  - The primary scientific targets of the European COST Action Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems (MPM4CPS) are: i) the conceptualization of techniques and tools for improving interoperability; ii) the development of new ontologies and formalisms (and the links between them) to deal with the heterogeneity; and, iii) to perform the integration of the problems resulting from several application domains, under a common MPM4CPS umbrella. The action also aims at crystallizing MPM4CPS contents into a suitable format for educational purposes. This entails to create the base for a European Master and PhD program in MPM4CPS involving several European leading Universities and setting up the respective discipline roadmap facing the challenge of development mutually recognized cross-domain expertise based study program in CPS. This paper offers a methodology for the creation of CPS expert profile for educational purposes, provides an analysis of results of an initial survey of experts in the field and sets up a discussion about the next steps of the research. The paper depicts the work in a progress.

AB  - Software performance antipatterns (SPAs) document common performance problems in software architecture and design and how to fix them. They differ from software antipatterns in their focus on the performance of the software. This paper addresses performance antipatterns that are common in today's Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). We describe the characteristics of today's CPS that cause performance problems that have been uncommon in real-time embedded systems of the past. Three new performance antipatterns are defined and their impact on CPS is described. Six previously defined performance antipatterns are described that are particularly relevant to today's CPS. The paper concludes with some observations on how this work is useful in the design, implementation, and operation of CPS.

TI  - Optimizing Energy Consumption in Cyber Physical Systems using Multiple Operating Modes
T2  - 2018 IEEE 8TH ANNUAL COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATION WORKSHOP AND CONFERENCE (CCWC)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th IEEE Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC)
CL  - Las Vegas, NV
AB  - Energy consumption has been considered as an important optimization metric in developing Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). In addition to considering the minimal power consumption in the design cycle, the effective management of power consumption during operation of the system is also a key for reducing the overall energy budget. In this paper, we target at improving energy consumption of CPS using multiple operating modes. Our target CPS architecture consists of a set of sensor and actuator modules, a communication network, and a computation and control unit. The components in the system have multiple operating modes such as active mode, idle mode, and some low power operating modes. If a component has not been used for a certain time period, the component is placed into lower operating modes gradually. Once a sensor detects an activity, all the components go to an active operating mode and the system responds to the environmental change. In order to show the viability of the proposed technique, we conduct some experiments in various environmental setups. The experimental evaluation shows around 33% energy gain compared to the systems that does not have any low power operating modes.

TI  - Triton: a Domain Specific Language for Cyber-Physical Systems
T2  - 2021 22ND IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY (ICIT)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 22nd IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The design of cyber-physical systems is non-trivial, and often filled with tedious, error prone tasks that could be represented in a better way. Engineers often work with low-level languages such as C and C++, real-time operating systems, or straight on the metal under limited hardware constraints which requires engineers to have extensive domain specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose Triton, which is a language focused on increasing abstraction by providing high-level domain-specific features to engineers working on cyber-physical systems and IoT devices through a domain specific language (DSL). We propose dedicated code blocks to handle task scheduling at the language level, with the addition of a constraint system to handle faults, such as erroneous sensor data. Triton integrates with the Remote Method Delegation (RMD) platform to allow the developer to easily offload work to the cloud, in addition to providing native support for publish-subscribe network communications. The Triton prototype has been implemented for the JVM target, allowing for interroperability with other JVM languages and supports execution on any platform with an available JVM. Example code provided shows a clear reduction in boilerplate and a simple case-study shows the effectiveness of the proposed solution when compared with languages traditionally seen in embedded or cyber-physical systems development.

TI  - Blockchain-based cyber physical systems: Comprehensive model for challenge assessment
T2  - COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Blockchain as the trust-enabling technology has supported and transformed cyber-physical systems in recent years. Therefore, many organizations have adopted blockchain-based technology to develop industrial software-product-service systems. However, the implementation of blockchain at the organizational levels can be related with several technical, organizational, legal, financial, and environmental challenges (intra-organizational and inter-organizational). Analysis of these challenges will play a significant role in organizational performance. This study has investigated an extensive list of challenges of software blockchain-based implementation in cyber-physical systems. The proposed comprehensive model is applied to the software development industry in Iran as a case study. Based on the experts' opinions, challenge identification was conducted via the two-phase fuzzy Delphi method for medium and large organizations. Extensive quantitative and qualitative challenges are evaluated via the efficient best-worst fuzzy method. Obtained results indicate that smart contracts vulnerabilities and deterministic execution of the technical challenge group have the most critical importance and governance of the legal challenge group has the least vital importance. It is mentionable that most technical challenges have higher priority than other considered challenges.

T2  - TheScientificWorldJournal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Complex chemical, physical, and biological processes mediate nitrogen (N) transformations and movement during agricultural production, making the optimization of fertilizer use and environmental protection exceedingly difficult. Various computer models have been developed to simulate the site-specific fate and transport of N resulting from different crop production scenarios, but these models are very complex and difficult to use for most farmers, consultants, and conservationists. In an effort to facilitate access and simplify the use of sophisticated models, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has developed an Internet-based nitrogen analysis tool. Based on the Nitrate Leaching and Economic Analysis Package (NLEAP), the Web site allows a user to conduct multiyear N simulation modeling specific to a crop field. Servers handle much of the required data assembly and formatting, thus sparing the user"s resources. Model runs are executed on the servers and the results are transmitted to the user. This new tool is presented along with early implementation results.

TI  - Simulation Failure-Robust Bayesian Optimization for Data-Driven Parameter Estimation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in modeling and computation have resulted in high-fidelity digital twins capable of simulating the dynamics of a wide range of industrial systems. These simulation models often require calibration, or the estimation of an optimal set of parameters in some goodness-of-fit sense, to reflect a system's observed behavior. While searching over the parameter space is an inevitable part of the calibration process, simulation models are rarely designed to be valid for arbitrarily large parameter spaces. The application of existing calibration methods, therefore, often results in repeated model evaluations using parameters that can cause the simulations to be impractically slow or even result in catastrophic failure. In general, the shape of subregions in the parameter space that could result in simulation failure is unknown. In this article, we propose a novel failure-robust Bayesian optimization (FR-BO) algorithm that learns these failure regions (FRs) from online simulations and informs a Bayesian optimization algorithm to avoid FRs while optimizing model parameters. This results in acceleration of the optimizer's convergence and prevents wastage of time trying to simulate parameters with high failure probabilities. The effectiveness of the proposed FR-BO algorithm is demonstrated via a well-known benchmark example where we compare against state-of-the-art gradient matching techniques, and a practical example related to parameter estimation for digital twins of buildings.

TI  - A framework for Model-Driven Engineering of resilient software-controlled systems
T2  - COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Emergent paradigms of Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things expect cyber-physical systems to reliably provide services overcoming disruptions in operative conditions and adapting to changes in architectural and functional requirements. In this paper, we describe a hardware/software framework supporting operation and maintenance of software-controlled systems enhancing resilience by promoting a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) process to automatically derive structural configurations and failure models from reliability artifacts. Specifically, areflectivearchitecture developed arounddigital twinsenables representation and control of systemConfiguration Itemsproperly derived from SysML Block Definition Diagrams, providing support for variation. Besides, a plurality of distributed analytic agents for qualitative evaluation over executable failure models empowers the system with runtime self-assessment and dynamic adaptation capabilities. We describe the framework architecture outlining roles and responsibilities in a System of Systems perspective, providing salient design traits about digital twins and data analytic agents for failure propagation modeling and analysis. We discuss a prototype implementation following the MDE approach, highlighting self-recovery and self-adaptation properties on a real cyber-physical system for vehicle access control to Limited Traffic Zones.

AB  - CPS engineers need to possess both technical and social skills to run CPS-engineering projects successfully. Especially social skills are crucial as the project fails are mostly caused because of lacking social skills of project members. Besides strong social skills, CPS engineers need to have a wide range of various technical skills as the products they deal with are getting increasingly complex integrating hardware, software and some kinds of communication mechanism with their environment. Students studying CPS engineering need to be well prepared for their future jobs. Therefore, they need to get an opportunity to face with realistic project situations. In this work we describe our experience gathered during the first run of a CPS engineering course based on a novel task-centric holistic agile teaching approach (T-CHAT).

TI  - Behavioral characterization: finding and using the influential factors in software process simulation models
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Most software process simulation work has focused on the roles and uses of software process simulators, on the scope of models, and on simulation approaches. Consequently, the literature reflects a growing body of models that have recently been characterized by modeling purpose, scope, key result variables, and simulation method. While the software process simulation arena is maturing, little effort appears to have been given to statistical evaluation of model behavior through sensitivity analysis. Rather, most of software process simulation experimentation has examined selected factors for the sake of understanding their effects with regard to particular issues, such as the economics of quality assurance or the impact of inspections practice. In a broad sense, sensitivity analysis assesses the effect of each input on model outputs. Here, we discuss its use for behaviorally characterizing software process simulators. This paper discusses the benefits of using sensitivity analysis to characterize model behavior; the use of experimental design for this purpose; our procedure for using designed experiments to analyze deterministic simulation models; the application of this procedure to four published software process simulators; the results of our analysis; and the merits of this approach.

T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - A simulation model for modeling photovoltaic (PV) system power generation and performance prediction is described in this paper. First, a comprehensive literature review of simulation models for PV devices and determination methods was conducted. The well-known five-parameter model was selected for the present study, and solved using a novel combination technique which integrated an algebraic simultaneous calculation of the parameters at standard test conditions (STC) with an analytical determination of the parameters under real operating conditions. In addition, the simulation performance of the model was compared with other models, and further validated by outdoor tests, which indicate that the proposed model fits well the entire set of experimental field test I-V curves of the PV module, especially at the characteristic points. After validation, this model was employed to predict the PV system power output under real conditions. The results show that the predictions agree very well with the PV plant field collected data. Thus, the operating performance of a standalone PV system located on a remote island in Hong Kong has been further evaluated with the aid of this model. It is found that the PV array power output is restricted by the status of the battery bank. This research demonstrates that the PV simulation model developed during the study is simple, but very helpful to PV system engineers in understanding the I-V curves and for accurately predicting PV system power production under outdoor conditions.

AB  - The verification and safety assurance of cyber-physical systems pose significant challenges, necessitating innovative solutions for their deployment. Machine Learning (ML) has gained prominence for its diverse applications, particularly in autonomous systems. Despite its potential, the integration of ML into safety-critical domains is met with caution due to multiple concerns. This paper introduces a monitoring system capable of predicting and mitigating requirement violations, featuring a discretized mathematical model for predictions. This monitor includes a decision mechanism to transit between high-assurance and high-performance controllers within a simplex architecture depending on the state of the system. This paper shows an example of how the suggested monitor is able to avoid a property violation by predicting it in advance. These advancements hold promise for enhancing the safety and reliability of cyber-physical systems in safety-critical applications.

TI  - Revitalizing Object Oriented Discrete-Event Simulation with The Simula and Demos Philosophy

CP  - International Multi-Conference on Engineering and Technological Innovation
CL  - Orlando, FL
AB  - After more than forty years since the key concepts of object orientation were first introduced in Simula, these concepts have evolved since then and have been implemented in most modern programming languages. Objects allowed the process view of modeling the world and this may be considered the best way of developing discrete event simulation models. The DEMOS package added more powerful simulation facilities to the Simula language. However, Simula and DEMOS never became widely used, despite the significant contribution to object orientation and simulation.The Object Oriented Simulation Language (OOSimL) is introduced as a modern language for developing discrete-event simulation models using the object-oriented and process modeling approaches. Part of the syntax and semantics of OOSimL was influenced by Simula and the DEMOS package.OOSimL can also be used effectively as a higher-level object-oriented general-purpose programming language. It supports the general conceptual framework of the process style of discrete-event simulation and that facilitates the teaching and learning of object-oriented modeling and simulation.

TI  - Leak Location of Pipeline with Multibranch Based on a Cyber-Physical System
T2  - INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Data cannot be shared and leakage cannot be located simultaneously among multiple pipeline leak detection systems. Based on cyber-physical system (CPS) architecture, the method for locating leakage for pipelines with multibranch is proposed. The singular point of pressure signals at the ends of pipeline with multibranch is analyzed by wavelet packet analysis, so that the time feature samples could be established. Then, the Fischer-Burmeister function is introduced into the learning process of the twin support vector machine (TWSVM) in order to avoid the matrix inversion calculation, and the samples are input into the improved twin support vector machine (ITWSVM) to distinguish the pipeline leak location. The simulation results show that the proposed method is more effective than the back propagation (BP) neural networks, the radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, and the Lagrange twin support vector machine.

AB  - This paper presents the architecture, the simulation model and scheduling algorithms for a cloud educational resource datacenter (CERD). CERD is a way to provide an economically profitable shared remote access to paid software for educational facilities. The architecture reflects the physical and logical structure of CERD and its components. The simulation model describes the simulation scheme and the method for generation and processing of user requests. The problem of efficient CERD scheduling for the optimal use of cloud virtual machines and software licenses have been studied in details. Within the research two intelligent algorithms for scheduling are implemented: the simulated annealing algorithm and genetic algorithm. The algorithm estimation criteria are the performance time and the count of satisfied requests. The most efficient algorithm will be used in further experimental researches on actual CERD implementation.

TI  - Using manufacturing process flow for time synchronization in HLA-based simulation
T2  - NINTH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DISTRIBUTED SIMULATION AND REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th IEEE International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real-Time Applications (DS-RT 2005)
CL  - Montreal, CANADA
AB  - Time synchronization has always been a critical deciding factor of whether interoperating simulation models using the High Level Architecture (HLA) is achievable efficiently. In this paper, we propose a conservative time synchronization algorithm that makes use of the manufacturing process flow information (a sequence of steps production lots flow through) in the computation of the request time. This time is used by the simulation federate to issue requests to advance time to the HLA Runtime Infrastructure (RTI). The proposed algorithm monitors the simulation events that potentially trigger external timestamp messages at the exit step and j processing steps before this exit step as well as simulation events that extend the timestamp of external messages. We evaluated the performance of this algorithm using a Borderless Fab simulation model on the AutoSched AP. The experimental results show that the algorithm performs much better than a straightforward use of the RTI's time synchronization, and the further back we went in looking at the processing steps, the better the execution time that was achieved.

CP  - 23rd Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS)
CL  - Boston, MA
AB  - Industry and academia are facing a significant challenge to address the shortage of required workforce to enable the realization of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). To run CPS-engineering projects, engineers are required to have multi-disciplinary technical skills due to the complex nature of CPS that consist of hardware, software and communication systems in a single product. However, having technical skills are not enough since CPS-engineering projects are prone to failure due to lack of social skills of project members. To be prepared for their future work as CPS engineers, students need an opportunity to gather experience in projects in which they face real life situations. This paper proposes a novel task-centric holistic agile teaching approach for teaching CPS-engineering in realistic up-to-date industry-like scenario. This approach especially accentuates the development of social skills. The work presented in this paper describes the implementation of the approach and presents the results of the students' feedback.

AB  - The integration of machine learning into cyber-physical systems (CPS) promises enhanced efficiency and autonomous capabilities, revolutionizing fields like autonomous vehicles and telemedicine. This evolution necessitates a shift in the software development life cycle, where data and learning are pivotal. Traditional verification and validation methods are inadequate for these AI-driven systems. This study focuses on the challenges in ensuring safety in learning-enabled CPS. It emphasizes the role of testing as a primary method for verification and validation, critiques current methodologies, and advocates for a more rigorous approach to assure formal safety.

TI  - Co-simulation Framework for AUTOSAR Multi-Core Processors with Message-based Network-on-Chips
T2  - 2016 IEEE 14TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS (INDIN)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 14th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)
CL  - Poitiers, FRANCE
AB  - Simulation environments play a very important role in the development of embedded systems helping system architects in exploring design decisions. However, the simulation of AUTOSAR multi-core processors with Network-on-Chips (NoCs) for inter-core communication is still a significant research problem. Message-based NoCs provide significant advantages for real-time embedded systems as in the case of the automobile industry. Such a simulation would provide early insights into the real-time behavior of the AUTOSAR application on the message-based multi-core chip. This paper presents as a novel contribution a co-simulation framework supporting the integration of the AUTOSAR architecture with NoC-based platforms. We describe a simulation model for application cores playing the role of virtual AUTOSAR ECUs on the MPSoC platform. The framework introduces an interface for the co-simulation of simulation models for the AUTOSAR-based software (virtual ECUs), the natural environment and the NoC behavior. This co-simulation interface combines a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) and a local coordinator for the synchronization and the data exchange between the simulators hosting the simulation models. The implementation is performed using the VEOS simulator for the AUTOSAR-based software and physical environment models, and the GEM5 simulator for the on-chip communication level. An anti-lock braking use case serves for the evaluation of the co-simulation framework.(1)

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART I-JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND CONTROL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses how a business model based on traditional maintenance can evolve to generate servitization strategies, with the help of remote maintenance support. The application of cyber-physical systems and cloud technologies play a key role for such maintenance purposes. In fact, the utilization of large quantities of data collected on machines and their processing by means of advanced techniques such as machine learning enable novel techniques for condition-based maintenance. New sensor solutions that could be used in maintenance and interaction with cyber-physical systems are also presented. Here, data models are an important part of these techniques because of the huge amounts of data that are produced and should be processed. These data models have been used in a real case, supported by the Machinery Information Management Open System Alliance Open System Architecture for Condition-Based Maintenance standard architecture, for streamlining the modeling of collected data. In this context, an industrial use case is described, to enlighten the application of the presented concepts in a working pilot. Finally, current and future directions for application of cyber-physical systems and cloud technologies to maintenance are discussed.

TI  - An instance-based-learning simulation model to predict knowledge assets evolution involved in potential digital transformation projects
T2  - KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT RESEARCH & PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Software engineering professionals must consider the appropriate technological solutions to meet their client's needs and the organisational impact. The decision to implement a solution is not explicitly based on how it empowers the knowledge assets. Organisational knowledge assets are the foundation of the knowledge economy and a key element in evaluating the health of an organisation. This paper provides software engineers with a simulation model which illustrates the decision-making process for the implementation of technological solutions based on an evaluation of their client's knowledge assets and how such assets impact and are impacted by the deployment of a solution. We use an agent-based approach and implement an instance-based learning model (a cognitive approach) to represent scenarios for experience-based decisions. 11 case studies were used to train the prediction engine and validate the usefulness of the model in generating scenarios and nurturing decision-making and user experiences.

TI  - Architectural Homeostasis in Self-Adaptive Software-Intensive Cyber-Physical Systems
T2  - SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE, ECSA 2016
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 10th European Conference on Software Architecture Workshops (ECSA)
CL  - Copenhagen, DENMARK
AB  - Self-adaptive software-intensive cyber-physical systems (sasiCPS) encounter a high level of run-time uncertainty. State-of-the-art architecture-based self-adaptation approaches assume designing against a fixed set of situations that warrant self-adaptation; as a result, failures may appear when sasiCPS operate in environment conditions they are not specifically designed for. In response, we propose to increase the homeostasis of sasiCPS, i.e., the capacity to maintain an operational state despite run-time uncertainty, by introducing run-time changes to the architecture-based self-adaptation strategies according to environment stimuli. In addition to articulating the main idea of architectural homeostasis, we describe three mechanisms that reify the idea: (i) collaborative sensing, (ii) faulty component isolation from adaptation, and (iii) enhancing mode switching. Moreover, our experimental evaluation of the three mechanisms confirms that allowing a complex system to change its self-adaptation strategies helps the system recover from runtime errors and abnormalities and keep it in an operational state.

AB  - The digital manufacturing cyber-physical system makes extensive use of computational tools, optimization methods and machine learning models. Development of a scalable, reliable and resilient future manufacturing system requires integrating security as a parameter in the design, manufacturing and qualification phases because numerous attack vectors exist for such connected manufacturing systems [1]. Many industrial parts have been redesigned using optimization and machine learning methods to save weight and improve functionality. Additive manufacturing has enabled manufacturing of such designs. It has been shown that using the same machine learning algorithms and manufacturing machines, designs and tool paths can be reverse engineered and part replicas can be created with high accuracy [2]. These observations require thinking of building security as an integral part of the manufacturing cyber-physical system. The entire digital manufacturing system, from the product design to manufacturing and qualification phases, can be built on the same platform, which can further increase concerns about intellectual property protection. Implementation of security in digital manufacturing cyber-physical system requires manufacturing and computer security professionals to work collaboratively on creating solutions specifically for DM. This talk will discuss the need for cybersecurity in the context of digital manufacturing and present examples of methods that can help in securing the manufacturing field from intellectual property theft and reverse engineering.

TI  - Utilizing Intervals in Component-based Design of Cyber Physical Systems

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE 16th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE)

AB  - Within the design of Cyber Physical Systems, model-based approaches are powerful means to describe and test the behavior of the system. Still, a good methodology is needed to go from the idealized model environment to an implementable system architecture that is capable of dealing with uncertainties in both the physical and the cyber subsystem. This paper presents a concept that explicitly utilizes intervals to express uncertainties in the physical system, the control process and the cyber system to improve the robustness and stability of the design. This interval concept has been integrated in a component-based framework that allows one to describe properties of the components out of which the CPS is composed. With a prototype implementation of the component framework, this paper shows the usefulness of this approach for an exemplary CPS. The results indicate the practical benefits of value intervals for property assessment of composed CPSs which can be exploited at design time as well as run time.

TI  - A Systematic Literature Review on Software Maintenance for Cyber-Physical Systems
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Review
AB  - Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are widely used in almost every sector of our modern life. They are also changing the way how systems are designed and maintained as CPS represent a combination of hardware and software components. Thus, the maintenance of CPS is challenging due to the various components that are involved, including embedded software technologies, internet of things (IoT), machine to machine interactions, connectivity and wireless networks. In this paper, we performed a systematic literature review of the existing studies related to software maintenance of CPS starting from January 2006 until December 2020. After extensive manual analysis and filtering, we identified a total of 109 primary studies that we deeply analyzed through different criteria to answer four main research questions about software maintenance activities, techniques, types and evaluation methods used in CPS. Based on the data collected from this survey, we created a taxonomy to classify the existing research works, identified research trends, and highlighted gaps in the literature and avenues for further research in the field.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 14th International Scientific Conference on eLearning and Software for Education - eLearning Challenges and New Horizons
CL  - Bucharest, ROMANIA
AB  - The article summarizes the long-term experiences of the author in the field of creation, usage and evaluation of didactic computer applications in education. In this article, there are systematized principles of creation and effective usage of didactic software. Special attention is paid to visualized controllable interactive simulation model and simulation experiments oriented to acquisition of new knowledge based on the own observations of the learner. The author summarizes recommendations regarding the graphic design and the interactivity of the didactic simulation models for learning. The preparation of recommendations and advice on how to build and use educational application was based on the pedagogical and psychological knowledge about the learning process. It takes into account how an individual receives and processes new information - how he/she builds his knowledge system. It is also important to set up the questions and tasks correctly, therefore they can be answered or solved by implementing simulation experiments. Knowledge system of the learner is not a static storage of isolated information and information units in his/her memory, but their transformation into active knowledge which is integrated and ordered to a system - connected into logical hyper structures and forms. The actual knowledge system enables an individual to solve non-standard problems not only in science, technology and various research areas from which the necessary, suitable and useable knowledge system is built but also in everyday life. If a person wants to design and implement educational software to support learning, he/she must respect the rules of creating and building a knowledge system and the pedagogical, psychological and didactic rules and principles of learning.

TI  - Transforming UML-Based System Descriptions into Simulation Models as Part of System Development Frameworks
T2  - COMPUTER AIDED SYSTEMS THEORY - EUROCAST 2009
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 12th International Conference on Computer Aided Systems Theory (EUROCAST 2009)
CL  - SPAIN
AB  - The support of the engineering process for computer-based systems by CO-Design Frameworks is the key to lower production cost and the, time-to-market for complex devices. Early in the design Cycle, system models must be rated, concerning design constraints and decisions must be made. To enable system engineers to gauge concurring system-realizations approaches, such frameworks must allow the prediction of key characteristics for the system under development, like performance, battery consumption and heat production. Hereby, the prediction of the system performance constitutes the vital constraint.In this work, we demonstrate, how an EQN-based performance simulation method can be seamlessly embedded into a Hardware / Software Co-Design framework based on UML system descriptions. The presented approach yields a performance simulation model, ready for the automated simulation process, and therefore fosters the performance evaluation of the system under development.

TI  - A systematic literature review on the industrial use of software process simulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Review
AB  - Context: Software process simulation modelling (SPSM) captures the dynamic behaviour and uncertainty in the software process. Existing literature has conflicting claims about its practical usefulness: SPSM is useful and has an industrial impact; SPSM is useful and has no industrial impact yet; SPSM is not useful and has little potential for industry.Objective: To assess the conflicting standpoints on the usefulness of SPSM.Method: A systematic literature review was performed to identify, assess and aggregate empirical evidence on the usefulness of SPSM.Results: In the primary studies, to date, the persistent trend is that of proof-of-concept applications of software process simulation for various purposes (e.g. estimation, training, process improvement, etc.). They score poorly on the stated quality criteria. Also only a few studies report some initial evaluation of the simulation models for the intended purposes.Conclusion: There is a lack of conclusive evidence to substantiate the claimed usefulness of SPSM for any of the intended purposes. A few studies that report the cost of applying simulation do not support the claim that it is an inexpensive method. Furthermore, there is a paramount need for improvement in conducting and reporting simulation studies with an emphasis on evaluation against the intended purpose. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Co-simulation platform for the assessment of transactive energy systems
T2  - ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into smart grids provides great flexibility in terms of ancillary services like the restoration of power supply, regulation of voltage levels, and reactive power support, among others. In this context, this work introduces a simulation model applied in the conception of a transactive energy system (TES) architecture. The proposed approach allows for the integration of distinct domains asso-ciated with smart grids considering the joint use of simulation tools that constitute a multidomain system, thus enabling the assessment of control actions, optimization algorithms, load flow, and communication infrastruc-ture. The Simulation Model for Transactive Energy Systems (SIMTES) framework relies on a multiagent system (MAS) and consists of two main stages: operation scheduling and real-time operation. The obtained results demonstrate the applicability of SIMTES, showing that the use of DERs associated with the grid and prosumers clearly influences energy pricing in electricity markets.

AB  - Changes in the Software requirements, technological advances require flexibility in software system development. Unexpected changes and mistakes cause difficulties. They effectively manage destructive changes, rework, and errors; project managers need to consider dynamic behavior loops of feedback on lead delays and disturbances. System Dynamics (SD) modeling methods have been used in the last few decades to meet this demand for analytical and project performance improvement. The SD model is used to improve the simulated change management policy for the Iranian project in the project's planning and petrochemical industry. Dynamic simulations of the SD model. The results show that effective Knowledge Management (KM) is a crucial control factor for the project's mechanically essential controls. Therefore, the proposal on the Knowledge Management aspect and attempts are to improve the manufacturing industry model. Effective formulation of dynamic simulation models project change management policy, time, consider Cost, quality, resources, and financial indicators. This model, such as financing, outsourcing activities, adjustment of the schedule, labor management, etc., to compare the alternative change management strategy in terms of the project's performance indicators to enable the decision-makers.

TI  - A SysML-based language for evaluating the integrity of simulation and physical embodiments of Cyber-Physical systems
T2  - ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating early design concepts is crucial as it impacts quality and cost. This process is often hindered by vague and uncertain design information. This article introduces the SysML-based Simulated-Physical Systems Modelling Language (SPSysML). It is a Domain-Specification Language for evaluating component reusability in Cyber-Physical Systems incorporating Digital Twins and other simulated parts. The proposed factors assess the design quantitatively. SPSysML uses a requirement-based system structuring method to couple simulated and physical parts with requirements. SPSysML-based systems incorporate DTs that perceive exogenous actions in the simulated world. SPSysML validation is survey- and application-based. First, we develop a robotic system for an assisted living project. We propose an SPSysML application procedure called SPSysAP that manages the considered system development by evaluating the system designs with the proposed quantitative factors. Asa result of the SPSysML application, we observed an integrity improvement between the simulated and physical parts of the system. Thus, more system components are shared between the simulated and physical setups. The system was deployed on the physical robot and two simulators based on ROS and ROS2. Additionally, we share a questionnaire for SPSysML assessment. The feedback that we already received is published in this article.

TI  - Virtual Reality in Discrete Event Simulation for Production-Assembly Processes
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The connection of simulation models with virtual reality (VR) technology is of great importance in implementing Industry 4.0 in industrial practice. The article deals with the use of virtual reality in discrete event simulation (DES) using the Tecnomatix Plant Simulation software to visualize, analyze and optimize the modelled production-assembly process. The importance of virtual reality is evident in the academic sphere in connection with interactive teaching and its use for industrial practice. The article presents a case study focused on creating a virtual environment and optimizing the production-assembly process in the TX Plant Simulation software environment. During the mentioned study, the analysis of production-assembly flows, the processing of input data into the simulation model, the creation of 3D elements for the needs of virtualization-which are not part of the TX Plant Simulation software library-and the visualization that simulates the real environment based on computational algorithms were carried out. Virtualization was solved using the Oculus Rift S Headset. The output is a generally applicable procedure for modelling and testing a virtual model with its verification on a case study.

TI  - Towards a cyber physical system for personalised and automatic OSA treatment
T2  - IET CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS: THEORY & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a breathing disorder that takes place in the course of the sleep and is produced by a complete or a partial obstruction of the upper airway that manifests itself as frequent breathing stops and starts during the sleep. The real-time evaluation of whether or not a patient is undergoing OSA episode is a very important task in medicine in many scenarios, as for example for making instantaneous pressure adjustments that should take place when Automatic Positive Airway Pressure devices are used during the treatment of OSA. Here, the design of a possible Cyber Physical System (CPS) suited to real-time monitoring of OSA is described, and its software architecture and possible hardware sensing components are detailed. It should be emphasised here that this study does not deal with a full CPS, rather with a software part of it under a set of assumptions on the environment. The study also reports some preliminary experiments about the cognitive and learning capabilities of the designed CPS involving its use on a publicly available sleep apnoea database.

AB  - The rise of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) brings a new level of complexity into the world of software and systems development and operations. Dynamic dependencies and changes throughout the product lifecycle necessarily impact system performance. At the same time, these new, highly automated systems require exceptional reliability and usability. From a software vendor's view, experiences with enterprise systems can be extrapolated and transformed into a new model of system operations, where product and service merge to form one common business model. A software vendor must overcome the challenge of ensuring sustainability in a rapidly changing technical environment. The paper shows how this and other challenges can be addressed from a vendor's view. It explores how a product portfolio for connected systems can be designed, which capabilities need to be covered, and how systems should be delimited to guarantee robustness and flexibility. Finally it describes the demand for new public architecture concepts that should be covered by academic research.

TI  - A model-driven approach to machine learning and software modeling for the IoT Generating full source code for smart Internet of Things (IoT) services and cyber-physical systems (CPS)
T2  - SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS MODELING
M3  - Article
AB  - Models are used in both Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). SE models may specify the architecture at different levels of abstraction and for addressing different concerns at various stages of the software development life-cycle, from early conceptualization and design, to verification, implementation, testing and evolution. However, AI models may provide smart capabilities, such as prediction and decision-making support. For instance, in Machine Learning (ML), which is currently the most popular sub-discipline of AI, mathematical models may learn useful patterns in the observed data and can become capable of making predictions. The goal of this work is to create synergy by bringing models in the said communities together and proposing a holistic approach to model-driven software development for intelligent systems that require ML. We illustrate how software models can become capable of creating and dealing with ML models in a seamless manner. The main focus is on the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT), where both ML and model-driven SE play a key role. In the context of the need to take a Cyber-Physical System-of-Systems perspective of the targeted architecture, an integrated design environment for both SE and ML sub-systems would best support the optimization and overall efficiency of the implementation of the resulting system. In particular, we implement the proposed approach, called ML-Quadrat, based on ThingML, and validate it using a case study from the IoT domain, as well as through an empirical user evaluation. It transpires that the proposed approach is not only feasible, but may also contribute to the performance leap of software development for smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) which are connected to the IoT, as well as an enhanced user experience of the practitioners who use the proposed modeling solution.

AB  - A Cyber-physical System (CPS) architecture in shop floor is proposed for achieving the goals of intelligent manufacturing. The proposed architecture provides a guideline to construct a CPS system from the hardware interconnection, to the data acquisition, processing, and visualization, and the final knowledge acquisition and learning. Furthermore, three key enabling technologies are discussed, i.e., interconnection and interoperability among different devices, industrial big data analysis for production process management and control, and intelligent decision-making based on knowledge acquisition and learning methodology. Finally, a CPS added on a small-scale flexible automated production line in our Micro Manufacturing System Lab is taken as an example to verify the feasibility of proposed CPS architecture.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Software Process
CL  - Minneapolis, MN
AB  - This paper describes the application of comparative simulation models to reason about the economic risks and benefits of adopting new methods and tools for software development. It addresses three questions: (i) can technology substitution be modeled with sufficient confidence? (ii) what modeling strategy is most appropriate? and (iii) what are the outcomes of modeling technology substitution on an industrial case study? The end goal is to develop models that support economic evaluations that are necessary and sufficient to support technology substitution decisions. Such models will help developers and managers to assess the value of a new technology and employ strategies to de-risk its adoption.

TI  - Reliability, failure detection and prevention in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with agents
T2  - CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The complexity of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) opens up several challenges regarding the assurance of high levels of reliability. Therefore, we need to develop a new data quality analysis and new CPS components/subsystems for the detection, isolation, recovery, and prevention of failures and intrusion events. Furthermore, we have to develop new reliability assessment models and metrics in order to properly evaluate CPSs. Agent technologies, through their characteristics such as autonomy, social ability, reactivity, and proactivity, have the potential to address these challenges and requirements. We propose a multi-agent based solution, namely ReliaCPS, for detecting and preventing the failures of the system components of CPSs. We also use a case study of a CPS for monitoring ambient parameters to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Our results indicate improvements in terms of reliability metrics (32.69% for the mean time between failures and mean time to failure, 50% for the mean time to repair and 0.94% for reliability function over time).

AB  - Eclipse Arrowhead, an upcoming open source framework for designing cyber-physical system-of-systems, is starting to become complete enough to be the subject of serious evaluation and prototyping. As a consequence, it has become increasingly pertinent to provide software that makes it straightforward to use and learn it. To address this, we here present Arrowhead Kalix, a Java 11 library designed for the efficient and effective development of correct, concise and relatively performant Arrowhead-compliant systems. In this paper, we outline the philosophy behind the design of the library, its architecture, its fundamental components and give some examples of how it can be used. The purpose of the paper is both to educate and to provide academics using Kalix with a credible point of reference.

AB  - Software is the most crucial innovation driver for cyber-physical systems and validating its correct behavior is crucial to many application domains from automated vehicles to medical systems, smart homes, and smart cities. Typical for these systems is that software errors can cause severe ramifications and can be very costly to fix. Consequently, facilitating a priori software validation and verification is of crucial importance for cyber-physical system development. We hence present a model-based method which facilitates test creation, test maintenance, and improved test coverage in automotive software engineering. To this end, we translate specification models used in the BMW Group's SMArDT engineering methodology into activity diagrams, apply optimizations, and ultimately generate test cases. We realize these transformations using the MontiCore language workbench and report on ongoing evaluation at the BMW Group. First results indicate that model-based test case creation can provide great benefits to all stakeholders, once the initial learning efforts have been mastered.

TI  - Architecture-level particular risk modeling and analysis for a cyber-physical system with AADL
T2  - FRONTIERS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are becoming increasingly important in safety-critical systems. Particular risk analysis (PRA) is an essential step in the safety assessment process to guarantee the quality of a system in the early phase of system development. Human factors like the physical environment are the most important part of particular risk assessment. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the safety of the system considering human factor and physical factor. In this paper, we propose a new particular risk model (PRM) to improve the modeling ability of the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL). An architecture-based PRA method is presented to support safety assessment for the AADL model of a cyber-physical system. To simulate the PRM with the proposed PRA method, model transformation from PRM to a deterministic and stochastic Petri net model is implemented. Finally, a case study on the power grid system of CPS is modeled and analyzed using the proposed method.

AB  - With the evolution of the Internet of things and smart cities, a new trend of the Internet of simulation has emerged to utilise the technologies of cloud, edge, fog computing, and high-performance computing for design and analysis of complex cyber-physical systems using simulation. These technologies although being applied to the domains of big data and deep learning are not adequate to cope with the scale and complexity of emerging connected, smart, and autonomous systems. This study explores the existing state-of-the-art in automating, augmenting, and integrating systems across the domains of smart cities, autonomous vehicles, energy efficiency, smart manufacturing in Industry 4.0, and healthcare. This is expanded to look at existing computational infrastructure and how it can be used to support these applications. A detailed review is presented of advances in approaches providing and supporting intelligence as a service. Finally, some of the remaining challenges due to the explosion of data streams; issues of safety and security; and others related to big data, a model of reality, augmentation of systems, and computation are examined.

AB  - The architectural design can be considered the earliest specification of any software. When the architectural components are used to describe a simulation model, the architecture can be used as a vehicle to estimate the behavior of the final product. In this paper, an analysis model to evaluate web applications quality is proposed. The approach mix an ontological perspective to understand quality properties and an adaptation of Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) formalism to develop the set of simulation models required to represent the software architecture.

AB  - When modifying a cyber-physical system, the consequences of changes need to be understood beforehand to adequately assess risks and costs. Model-based change impact analysis is key for estimating the impact of a change before actually modifying the system. Existing change impact analysis approaches apply very similar algorithms for change propagation to instances of domain-specific metamodels. However, they lack fundamental concepts for domain-spanning change impact analysis. In this paper, we propose a generic methodology for domain-spanning change impact analysis to address limitations of existing approaches. Evaluation results show the relevancy and comprehensives of the methodology for several domains.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing use of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in a plethora of domains (e.g. healthcare, industry, smart homes, transportation, etc.) triggers an urgent demand for simulation frameworks that can simulate in an integrated manner all the components (i.e. CPUs, Memories, Networks, Physical Environment) of a system-under-design(SuD). By utilizing such a simulator, software design can proceed in parallel with physical development which results in the reduction of the so important time-to-market. The main problem, however, is that currently there is a shortage of such simulation frameworks; most simulators used for modelling the digital aspects of CPS applications (i.e. full-system CPU/Mem/Peripheral simulators) lack any support of the CPS physical aspects and vice versa. The presented fully-distributed simulation framework (APOLLON) is the first known open-source, high-performance simulator that can handle holistically complex CPSs including processors, peripherals, networks and physical aspects of them. APOLLON is an extension of the COSSIM simulation framework and it integrates, in a novel and efficient way, a combined processing and network simulator with the widely-used Ptolemy physical simulator, in a transparent way. Our highly integrated approach is further augmented with Machine Learning capabilities by implementing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) recurrent neural networks in both the Cyber and Physical domains, enabling users to develop their complex recurrent neural networks significantly fast and accurately. APOLLON has been evaluated when executing a number of benchmarks and real-world use cases; the end results demonstrate that the presented approach has up to 99% accuracy in the reported SuD aspects.

CL  - Umea Univ, Umea, SWEDEN
AB  - Modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) need to be able to operate efficiently and reliably within continually changing, uncertain, and unanticipated environments. Namely, these systems should be capable of learning, automatically reconfiguring themselves, and be able to cooperate and collaborate with other CPSs. In a nutshell, exhibit human-like, smart capabilities in an autonomic manner. However, engineering such systems is all but trivial, primarily because we need to develop systems at design-time that are capable of autonomously coping with the uncertainty and change at runtime. Therefore, not only the importance of self-adaptivity as a system's feature increases, but it becomes a fundamental approach for the systems to continue meeting their functional specifications, fulfilling their business objectives while preserving the performance-despite all the runtime changes that the system may encounter. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes the initial research vision and agenda with the envisioned contributions towards an approach for self-adaptation of cooperative, smart CPSs through shared knowledge and learning.

AB  - Today's products are characterized by a highly interdisciplinary level. Likewise, household appliances are affected to this evolution. Mechanical structures, actuators, sensors and distributed control units can be found in modern tumble dryers, as well as in other mechatronic systems. The main challenge in the development process of such systems is to ensure the functionality which contains the proper interaction within the components of the tumble dryer. Mechanical knowledge, thermodynamical expertise, control engineering competence and knowledge in software have to be managed and brought together. Apart from the interdisciplinary challenge, the rising functionality of modern tumble dryers leads to a further challenge, which appears in the development. Intelligent processes within their components have to be tested intensively, to ensure the benefit they promise. Time-consuming iterations during the development are inacceptable, to guarantee a specified start of production.To face the mentioned challenges in the development process, Miele already applies model-based systems engineering in its development [1]. Using simulation models enables Miele to analyze a lot of different and complex concepts of tumble dryers, to consider innovative and novel ways to dry clothes. As part of these Model-in-the-Loop simulations in early phases of the development, holistic system simulation-models are established. These models basically contain physical and control behavior. Immediately after different concepts are analyzed by the virtual systems, the concepts have to be validated.This work focusses the Rapid-Control-Prototyping (RCP) technology to validate novel innovative heating concepts for tumble dryers. Evaluation different concepts and the integration into home appliance processes is a formidable challenge, accepted in this paper. The RCP technology enables to test first component setups of heating systems, which are controlled by the simulation model of the controller. To set up the Rapid-Control-Prototyping scenario, a testing bench is built up, including equally the software environment. The controller models are elaborated and simulated within the MathWorks (R) environment, in detail (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hybrid attack graphs are a powerful tool when analyzing the cybersecurity of a cyber-physical system. However, it is important to ensure that this tool correctly models reality, particularly when modelling safety-critical applications, such as a nuclear reactor. By automatically verifying that a simulation reaches the state predicted by an attack graph by analyzing the final state of the simulation, this verification procedure can be accomplished. As such, a mechanism to estimate if a simulation reaches the expected state in a hybrid attack graph is proposed here for the nuclear reactor domain.

AB  - With the development of science and technology, simulation technology has been widely applied in the aerospace, power grid, medical and health care, financial, social and other fields. Under the traditional simulation environment, usually the operation of the simulation model in the ideal state, running status of model in the real environment is unable to predict in advance. Fault injection is artificially produced and introduced to the target system, thus accelerate the system errors and fault assessment technology. In system modeling and simulation phase, using fault injection could find the system error and improve system reliability. Through the analysis of the system fault, this paper puts forward the abstract definition of fault, uses variation patterns to describe the fault behavior, and gives ST_Net Petri net system and meta model definition of fault, discuss the injection mechanism and influence of the properties of variation pattern.

AB  - Today's computing world features a growing number of cyber-physical systems that require the cooperation of many physical devices. Examples include autonomous cars and co-working robots, which are expected to appropriately adapt to any possible context they find themselves in (e.g. the presence of a nearby human).However, the controlling software continues to be developed using established object-oriented modelling techniques like UML, which do not natively possess a notion of context and thus may introduce accidental complexity. With increasing complexity, the probability of the introduction of software errors rises, which can have fatal consequences in cyber-physical systems. To address this, we envision a model-driven architecture for self-adaptive cyberphysical systems that explicitly models structured context. Entities are modelled as message-passing parallel processes and can play roles in specific contexts, which dynamically alter their behaviour and relationships with other parts of the system. Since the planning of complex adaptations can be cumbersome in real-world scenarios, we envision an intuitive formulation of adaptations as graph rewriting rules on the context model.This paper discusses the current state of research and identifies open research challenges. Based on this, the envisioned architecture as well as an evaluation strategy are presented.

TI  - Deep Learning Approaches to Source Code Analysis for Optimization of Heterogeneous Systems: Recent Results, Challenges and Opportunities
T2  - JOURNAL OF LOW POWER ELECTRONICS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - To cope with the increasing complexity of digital systems programming, deep learning techniques have recently been proposed to enhance software deployment by analysing source code for different purposes, ranging from performance and energy improvement to debugging and security assessment. As embedded platforms for cyber-physical systems are characterised by increasing heterogeneity and parallelism, one of the most challenging and specific problems is efficiently allocating computational kernels to available hardware resources. In this field, deep learning applied to source code can be a key enabler to face this complexity. However, due to the rapid development of such techniques, it is not easy to understand which of those are suitable and most promising for this class of systems. For this purpose, we discuss recent developments in deep learning for source code analysis, and focus on techniques for kernel mapping on heterogeneous platforms, highlighting recent results, challenges and opportunities for their applications to cyber-physical systems.

AB  - This paper is a short introduction to the TET-DEC (Teaching, Education and Training for Dependable Embedded Cyber-physical Systems) Special Session at Euromicro SEAA 2015. It provides some views from European research projects' perspectives on the role of teaching, education and training in context of achieving a sustainable innovation ecosystem as e.g. the European Technology Platform (ETP) ARTEMIS is aiming at. In 2014, ARTEMIS together with the ETPs ENIAC and EPoSS formed as "Private Partners" with the European Commission (EC) and the public authorities of the member states the new ECSEL Joint Technology Initiative (JTI) (Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership). In the "Cyber-physical Systems" Part of ECSEL the ARTEMIS ideas have been continued. Studies and examples from different European projects are discussed, particularly the industrial E&T Use Case of the project SafeCer (Safety Certification of Software-Intensive Systems with Reusable Components). In ARTEMIS-IA (Industrial Association of ARTEMIS) the ARTEMIS Working Group on Education and Training is working on the E&T issues. In three ARTEMIS projects (R3-COP, MBAT and SafeCer) was tried to deliver supporting training material to promote more widespread use of the outcomes of the projects.

TI  - Digital twins as run-time predictive models for the resilience of cyber-physical systems: a conceptual framework
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital twins (DT) are emerging as an extremely promising paradigm for run-time modelling and performability prediction of cyber-physical systems (CPS) in various domains. Although several different definitions and industrial applications of DT exist, ranging from purely visual three-dimensional models to predictive maintenance tools, in this paper, we focus on data-driven evaluation and prediction of critical dependability attributes such as safety. To that end, we introduce a conceptual framework based on autonomic systems to host DT run-time models based on a structured and systematic approach. We argue that the convergence between DT and self-adaptation is the key to building smarter, resilient and trustworthy CPS that can self-monitor, self-diagnose and-ultimately-self-heal. The conceptual framework eases dependability assessment, which is essential for the certification of autonomous CPS operating with artificial intelligence and machine learning in critical applications. This article is part of the theme issue 'Towards symbiotic autonomous systems'.

TI  - The AXIOM platform for next-generation cyber physical systems
T2  - MICROPROCESSORS AND MICROSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are widely used in many applications that require interactions between humans and their physical environment. These systems usually integrate a set of hardware-software components for optimal application execution in terms of performance and energy consumption. The AXIOM project (Agile, eXtensible, fast I/O Module), presented in this paper, proposes a hardware-software platform for CPS coupled with an easy parallel programming model and sufficient connectivity so that the performance can scale-up by adding multiple boards. AXIOM supports a task-based programming model based on OmpSs and leverages a high-speed, inexpensive communication interface called AXIOM-Link. The board also tightly couples the CPU with reconfigurable resources to accelerate portions of the applications. As case studies, AXIOM uses smart video surveillance, and smart home living applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation Framework for Assessing Validation Methods on Modeling and Simulation Models
T2  - JOHNS HOPKINS APL TECHNICAL DIGEST
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling and simulation (M & S) is a critical step throughout the systems engineering process for developing and fielding a combat system. Verification and, more specifically, validation are essential to determining whether a simulation is credible and reliable. Although policy and guidance increasingly emphasizes the importance of rigorous validation founded in the application of strong statistical analysis, implementation continues to be challenging. As a result, test organizations and statisticians have been interested in developing a robust approach for measuring the performance of the validation methods used to assess model accuracy. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) developed a flexible and extensible framework to evaluate the performance of the validation methods. The framework provides the modularity to evaluate multiple validation methods and is sufficiently generic to support assessment of multiple simulation models. This article details the framework design and the analysis of multiple statistical validation methods, including an exemplar assessment of the methods applied for a recently accredited missile system simulation.

CL  - Kallithea, GREECE
AB  - In silico studies allow the use of computer models to simulate the environment, object, and subject behavior of an experiment. They are valuable tools to support the quantitative analysis of the behavior of different types of projects because they allow the use of different techniques such as stochastic and analytical methods to evaluate the impact of project decisions without the real execution costs. Recently, in silico studies have been used to study distributed software development projects. In this paper, we present a simulation model defined by a set of variables that describe the dynamics of Distributed Software Development (DSD) projects. The assessment of our simulation model is based on a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) where we seek evidence, from primary studies published until October 2018, that the variables and relationships in our model do exist in actual DSD projects. We use a SLR as a validation mechanism. Our results are twofold. First, there is a gap of studies on some variables including knowledge expertise and task allocation strategy in distributed software development projects. And, second, there still is a lack of data to support results related to productivity, especially testing activities, on DSD projects. Despite the problem of lack of common terminology for reporting the results on DSD studies, we argue that we need more studies to be able to clearly infer the dynamics of the relationship between variables on distributed software development. Our study brings one step closer to fulfill this gap.

AB  - Scheduling and control of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are becoming increasingly complex, requiring the development of new techniques that can effectively lead to their advancement. This is also the case for failure detection and scheduling component replacements. The large number of factors that influence how failures occur during operation of a CPS may result in maintenance policies that are time-monitoring based, which can lead to suboptimal scheduling of maintenance. This paper investigates how to improve maintenance scheduling of such complex embedded systems, by means of monitoring in real-time the critical components and dynamically adjusting the optimal time between maintenance actions. The proposed technique relies on machine learning classification models in order to classify component failure cases vs. non-failure cases, and on real-time updating of the maintenance policy of the sub-system in question. The results obtained from the domain of printers show that a model that is responsive to the environmental changes can enable consumable savings, while keeping the same product quality, and thus be relevant for industrial purposes.

TI  - A Decentralized Compositional Framework for Dependable Decision Process in Self-Managed Cyber Physical Systems
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) need to interact with the changeable environment under various interferences. To provide continuous and high quality services, a self-managed CPS should automatically reconstruct itself to adapt to these changes and recover from failures. Such dynamic adaptation behavior introduces systemic challenges for CPS design, advice evaluation and decision process arrangement. In this paper, a formal compositional framework is proposed to systematically improve the dependability of the decision process. To guarantee the consistent observation of event orders for causal reasoning, this work first proposes a relative time-based method to improve the composability and compositionality of the timing property of events. Based on the relative time solution, a formal reference framework is introduced for self-managed CPSs, which includes a compositional FSM-based actor model (subsystems of CPS), actor-based advice and runtime decomposable decisions. To simplify self-management, a self-similar recursive actor interface is proposed for decision (actor) composition. We provide constraints and seven patterns for the composition of reliability and process time requirements. Further, two decentralized decision process strategies are proposed based on our framework, and we compare the reliability with the static strategy and the centralized processing strategy. The simulation results show that the one-order feedback strategy has high reliability, scalability and stability against the complexity of decision and random failure. This paper also shows a way to simplify the evaluation for dynamic system by improving the composability and compositionality of the subsystem.

AB  - Software embedded in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) usually has a large life-cycle and is continuously evolving. The increasing expansion of IoT and CPSs has highlighted the need for additional mechanisms for remote deployment and updating of this software, to ensure its correct behaviour. Performance problems require special attention, as they may appear in operation due to limitations in lab testing and environmental conditions.In this context, we propose a microservice-based method to detect performance problems in CPSs. These microservices will be deployed in installation to detect performance problems in run-time when new software versions are deployed. The problem detection is based on Machine Learning algorithms, which predict the performance of a new software release based on knowledge from previous releases. This permits taking corrective actions so that system reliability is guaranteed.

TI  - Modeling and Control of Discrete Event and Hybrid Systems Using Petri Nets and OPC Unified Architecture
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Discrete event system is a type of system, which changes its state based on asynchronously occuring events. One of many approaches of describing this category of systems is a mathematical formalism called the Petri Net. This article introduces an original software solution, leveraging the graphical representation of this formalism in conjunction with the communication standard OPC Unified Architecture. This combination enables the user to model and control discrete event and hybrid systems using an intuitive, user-friendly graphical interface. The software application also brings new possibilities into scope of this academic domain due to the implementation of a Petri Net formalism extension - continuous elements, which greatly expands the area of systems, which can be modelled and controlled using this tool. The developed software tool was successfully verified in control of a virtual systems. Offering a graphical environment for the design of discrete event / hybrid system control algorithms, it can be used for education, research and practice in cyber-physical systems (Industry 4.0).

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Resilience Week (RWS)
CL  - Wilmington, DE
AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) consist of embedded computers with sensing and actuation capability, and are integrated into and tightly coupled with a physical system. Because the physical and cyber components of the system are tightly coupled, cyber-security is important for ensuring the system functions properly and safely. However, the effects of a cyber-attack on the whole system may be difficult to determine, analyze, and therefore detect and mitigate. This work presents a model based software development framework integrated with a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed for rapidly deploying CPS attack experiments. The framework provides the ability to emulate low level attacks and obtain platform specific performance measurements that are difficult to obtain in a traditional simulation environment. The framework improves the cybersecurity design process which can become more informed and customized to the production environment of a CPS. The developed framework is illustrated with a case study of a railway transportation system.

AB  - IBM-Watson is among the leading intelligent systems available today. It is extremely complex, employing multiple processors, peripherals, interconnects, along with specialized software and applications. Developing software for this architecture, in absence of target platform, is an extremely error-prone affair. Bringup of software once the hardware is available detects large amount of bugs, throwing the project cost and schedule out of control. This paper introduces a methodology based on IBM-Watson system-level simulation, developed using high-level simulation models of all the components of the target architecture. This methodology helps to debug, verify and fine-tune the IBM-Watson software much before the availability of the target hardware. Use of this methodology enables detecting the bugs much earlier in the development cycle. Majority of the defects are removed much earlier and software bringup-time on actual hardware has reduced from months to days!

AB  - Architecting Cyber-Physical Systems is not trivial since their intrinsic nature of mixing software and hardware components poses several challenges, especially when the physical space is subject to dynamic changes, e.g., paths of robots suddenly not feasible due to objects occupying transit areas or doors being closed with a high probability. This paper provides a quantitative evaluation of different architectural patterns that can be used for cyber-physical systems to understand which patterns are more suitable under some peculiar characteristics of dynamic spaces, e.g., frequency of obstacles in paths. We use stochastic performance models to evaluate architectural patterns, and we specify the dynamic aspects of the physical space as probability values. This way, we aim to support software architects with quantitative results indicating how different design patterns affect some metrics of interest, e.g., the system response time. Experiments show that there is no unique architectural pattern suitable to cope with all the dynamic characteristics of physical spaces. Each architecture differently contributes when varying the physical space, and it is indeed beneficial to switch among multiple patterns for an optimal solution.

AB  - Many fundamental decisions in information system (IS) design are influenced by how quickly work must be done-where to provide computer support and the choice of hardware platform and data base management system-yet modeling the overall dynamics of designs is not a routine part of IS development. We believe that design performance modeling can be made more accessible to IS developers by allowing the specification of performance models via conventional data flow diagrams (DFDs) annotated with information on the performance of the DFD components. A prototype simulation environment has been developed that produces stochastic simulation results automatically from annotated DFDs. The prototype reads DFDs from a custom tool and formulates a corresponding simulation model. The prototype provides model-based expert advice in the use of the simulation model and in interpretation of its output. The use of the prototype is illustrated through its application to the quality assurance subsystem of a manufacturing operation.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is changing the way we perceive information. It has inspired solutions for a variety of everyday problems. With the advent of IoT, the internet will house several "intelligent "objects capable of making their own decisions and communicate with each other in an efficient manner. SOA services coupled with decision making capability helps in efficient processing of information. Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) represent a new paradigm of future intelligent systems. Cyber Physical System consist of loosely coupled subsystems which interact with mechanisms of Service oriented Architecture (SOA). Web service is a very important candidate technology to achieve SOA requirements that allows the service providers to publish their services to many service consumers.The proposed paper aims at providing the basic architecture of IoT and CPSs and a system which provides notification (as a future work) through email or SMS and recommendation services to the end users. A recommendation system is basically used for predicting users preferences and interests. Recommender Systems, these days, are no longer personal recommender systems, rather they are group recommender systems which list out recommendations for a group of users.

TI  - A methodology for the design and deployment of distributed cyber-physical systems for smart environments
T2  - FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The pervasiveness and the growing processing capabilities of mobile and embedded computing systems are leading to a shift from the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm to the Fog computing scenario where the environment is instrumented with high-performance computing in the proximity to cyber-physical systems. The design of such systems requires an accurate planning, on the one hand, to ensure that specific application requirements will be properly met at run-time, and, on the other hand, to minimize the system's monetary costs. In this paper we present a methodology for an automated design and deployment of distributed cyber-physical systems into smart environments. We propose an engine based on a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation which takes in input a planimetry of the environment and a description of the applications and, based on a repository of available processing boards, identifies the cost-optimized instantiation of the processing architecture and the corresponding distribution of the application functionalities. By comparing our proposal with the existing methodologies that address similar problems we can highlight the following novelties: (i) we address a system architecture composed of heterogeneous devices, (ii) we adopt a realistic model of the environment, and (iii) we perform a joint co-exploration of architecture instantiation and applications mapping. An experimental evaluation, considering a smart office case study, demonstrates the potential of the proposed approach in minimizing the overall system monetary cost around 42% w.r.t. a baseline approach not exploiting planimetry information. Such results have been also confirmed by an extensive experimental campaign using synthetic problems, which also highlighted how the execution times of the optimization process are affordable for the design-time process.

AB  - Recent years have seen many empirical studies of model-based cyber-physical systems and commercial CPS development tool chains such as Matlab/Simulink. To benefit such research, this paper presents the by-far largest corpus of freely available Simulink models to date, containing over 1,000 models.Surprising findings based on this corpus include that (a) tool support for metric collection is not adequate and (b) users do not reuse model components as they would in object-oriented programs. The paper both confirms and contradicts earlier findings that are based on significantly fewer models, suggesting the utility of the corpus for future research. While others have not yet leveraged this model corpus, we hope that our freely available corpus and infrastructure will benefit future model-based empirical research and tool development efforts, by reducing the model-collection overhead and thus easing evaluation.

TI  - Modeling more software performance antipatterns in cyber-physical systems
T2  - SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS MODELING
M3  - Article
AB  - The design of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is challenging due to the heterogeneity of software and hardware components that operate in uncertain environments (e.g., fluctuating workloads), hence they are prone to performance issues. Software performance antipatterns could be a key means to tackle this challenge since they recognize design problems that may lead to unacceptable system performance. This manuscript focuses on modeling and analyzing a variegate set of software performance antipatterns with the goal of quantifying their performance impact on CPS. Starting from the specification of eight software performance antipatterns, we build a baseline queuing network performance model that is properly extended to account for the corresponding bad practices. The approach is applied to a CPS consisting of a network of sensors and experimental results show that performance degradation can be traced back to software performance antipatterns. Sensitivity analysis investigates the peculiar characteristics of antipatterns, such as the frequency of checking the status of resources, that provides quantitative information to software designers to help them identify potential performance problems and their root causes. Quantifying the performance impact of antipatterns on CPS paves the way for future work enabling the automated refactoring of systems to remove these bad practices.

AB  - This paper describes the flight test validation of a Trajectory Control System on a subscale lift-plus-cruise vertical takeoff and landing urban air mobility aircraft concept. The aircraft was sized using the Parametric Energy-based Aircraft Configuration Evaluator framework. A simulation model was developed using the Modular Aircraft Dynamics and Control Algorithm Simulation Platform. The flight control system was developed and optimized using a genetic algorithm optimization algorithm. The developed flight control system architecture was deployed to a Pixhawk flight controller for flight test validation. Flight testing was conducted at Sharpe Field, near Tuskegee, Alabama, which was a training airfield used by the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II. Piloted flights were performed to validate the flight control system and simulation model. The results demonstrated the successful implementation of Simplified Vehicle Operations design philosophies within the proposed flight control system through a series of flight tests, including manually piloted transition flights.

TI  - Social navigation framework for autonomous vehicle with hierarchical cyber-physical system architecture
T2  - ADVANCED ROBOTICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - An autonomous vehicle operating alongside humans should ideally have a high social capability, such as being able to communicate with humans, negotiate space, predict reactions, etc. This can be achieved by a prediction feature trained with diverse data on human behavior. Hierarchical cyber-physical system (CPS) architecture design, which sends the prediction feature to an external server while observing a limited operational design domain (ODD) and acquiring data continuously, has great potential to refine the training process as well as improve the performance. However, this architecture design requires the planning and prediction modules to be explicitly decoupled, which takes away from the recent success on social navigation. In this paper, we propose a novel autonomous navigation framework enabling social behavior while decoupling the planning and prediction modules to take advantage of the hierarchical CPS architecture. In the proposed framework, pedestrian trajectories are predicted as reactions to pre-generated candidates for an ego vehicle trajectory, and the ego vehicle trajectory is then selected to maximize mutual benefit to both the ego vehicle and surrounding pedestrians. We evaluated the proposed framework with simulations using the social force model and found that it was able to achieve the social behavior.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Winter Simulation Conference on Simulation - Making Decisions in a Complex World
CL  - Washington, DC
AB  - JARTA is a Java library to model and fit Autoregressive-To-Anything (ARTA) processes. These processes are able to capture the dependency structure of a system, in contrast to commonly used models, that assume independently distributed random values. This study uses a simulation model of a warehouse to demonstrate the importance of capturing dependencies when modeling stochastic processes. Consequently there is a need for a suitable modeling approach. With JARTA we provide a modern software package to model processes with an appropriate dependency structure. Its two main goals are providing a clean code base for integration in other projects and high transparency for educational purposes. To support these goals JARTA is published under an open source license at http://sourceforge.net/projects/jarta/.

AB  - The lack of conceptualization and inclusion of human, social, and organizational dynamics in software process simulation models is a critical obstacle in (1) exploring the impact of socio-technical dimensions in software development and (2) measuring the performance of software processes. This paper presents a conceptual multi-resolution modeling and simulation framework that delineates various dimensions of organizational behavior as they relate to software development. The framework conceptualizes software development as a transformation system from the perspective of knowledge acquisition and cognitive systems engineering. Explicit distinctions between the strategy, operational, and technical views are clearly presented. Specifically, the paper formulates a preliminary conceptual model and elaborates on design space of the operational and technical views that focus on organizational, social, and human dynamics in process performance modeling and simulation.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PARALLEL PROGRAMMING
M3  - Article
AB  - Data volumes are drastically increasing, immense information created over the past 10 years exceeds the storage capacity across all media types. While the storage systems play a critical role in modern memory hierarchy, their interfaces and simulation models are overly simplified by computer-system architecture research. Specifically, gem5, a popular full system simulator, includes only Integrated Drive Electronics interface, which was originally designed three decades ago, and simulates the underlying storage device with a constant latency value. In this work, we implement an NVMe disk and controller to enable a realistic storage stack of next generation interfaces and integrate them into gem5 and a high-fidelity solid state disk simulation model. We verify the functionalities of NVMe that we implemented, using a standard user-level tool, called NVMe command line interface. Our evaluation results reveal that the performance of a high performance SSD can significantly vary based on different software stacks and storage controllers even under the same condition of device configurations and degrees of parallelism. Specifically, the traditional interface caps the performance of the SSD by 95%, whereas NVMe interface we implement in gem5 can successfully reveal the true performance aggregated by many underlying flash-based media.

AB  - Cyber-Physical System is a kind of new systems by combining physical world with computation processes. There are many kinds of software in Cyber-Physical System, and the software system is composed of them. It's difficult for the software system to examine the attributes such as correctness, safety, reliability by using software testing or formal method. So we propose a model for CPS software system trustworthiness evaluation based on trustworthiness attributes. Firstly, present a method to calculate the satisfaction of trustworthiness attributes by considering the aging of trustworthiness evidences; secondly, based on the weight distribution, a software trustworthiness calculating method is brought forward. Then based on the trustworthiness of software and the logical structures of the software system, we present a method to evaluate the trustworthiness level of CPS software system. At Last, we use an example to explain the effectiveness of the model.

AB  - The development of electric/electronic systems of today's vehicles is becoming more and more complex. New challenges are arising through highly distributed systems, so-called cyber-physical systems, which interact with and have an impact on the physical world. Methods and tools are thus essential to support the development process, especially when systems are safety-critical and demand reliability. In this paper, we present a novel method to decrease the design effort and speed up the verification of hardware. Our approach helps to avoid building safety-critical systems from scratch using industry standards like IP-XACT and UML/MARTE. Furthermore, our tool-aided method supports designers in making design-decisions for hardware very early in the development process. To demonstrate its efficiency, our methodology is applied to an industrial use-case of a battery management system. The results show that using our approach, it is possible to decrease development time and effort in the development of safety-critical systems.

AB  - Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (sCPS) are complex distributed decentralized systems that typically operate in an uncertain environment and thus have to be resilient to both network and individual node failures. At the same time, sCPS are commonly required to exhibit complex smart coordination while being limited in terms of resources such as network. However, optimizing network usage in a general sCPS coordination framework while maintaining the system function is complex. To better enable this, we allow incorporating key network parameters and constraints into the architecture, realized as an extension of the autonomic component ensembles paradigm. We show that when chosen well, these parameters make it possible to improve network resource usage without hampering the system utility too much. We demonstrate the parameter selection on a mobile gossip-based sCPS coordination scenario and use simulation to show the impact on overall system utility.

TI  - Toward Semantic Event-Handling for Building Explainable Cyber-Physical Systems
T2  - IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of cyber-physical systems (CPS), understanding system behaviors is crucial for ensuring reliability, efficiency, and trust. However, due to the increasing complexity of the modern CPS, gaining such understanding is becoming more challenging. In this article we provide a foundation for explaining system behavior through detected system events. To this end, the article proposes a technology-agnostic, semantic event-handling module to address the challenge of enhancing explainability within CPS. This module is designed to be part of the common architecture for Explainable CPS and, therefore, can be integrated seamlessly into existing CPS frameworks by providing different interfaces to access detected events. Two case studies in the smart building and smart grid domain are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the approach, utilizing an open-source software stack for the prototypical implementation. A qualitative evaluation of the proposed approach, based on the ISO/IEC 25010:2023, was used to analyze the software design. Our evaluation result shows that the semantic event-handling module is appropriate as a generic approach to handling events within a CPS. The module becomes a foundation for incorporating explainability into the system, which is needed as a foundation to ensure human trust and enable informed decision-making.

TI  - Simulation of the Bidding Behavior of Electricity Retailers Based on the Q-Learning Algorithm
T2  - WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, the reform of electricity marketization has become a new trend in the development of the world's electric power industry and electricity retailers have a huge role in further activating power market competition. Simulation of the bidding behavior of electricity sales companies is helpful to analyze the rationality of the transaction behaviors of electricity sales companies and predict the potential risks of market operation. Considering the complex and diverse behaviors of electricity retailers and the immaturity of existing simulation technologies in the power sales market, this paper proposes a Q-learning algorithm-based simulation method for the bidding behavior of electricity retailers. Firstly, we analyze the factors influencing the bidding behavior of electricity retailers, then, we construct a simulation model of electricity retailers' bidding behavior based on the Q-learning algorithm, and finally, we simulate the bidding process of medium- and long-term trading in provincial power markets by using simultaneous learning from both sides of the generation and consumption. The results show that the behavior of different types of electricity retailers meets the expected level of the model and the simulation method has generalization and extension significance. On this basis, this paper also proposes a bid simulation system architecture based on the bid line simulation model of electricity retailers, which provides a certain reference value for market operation agencies to carry out the corresponding deduction work.

CP  - 7th International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT)
CL  - Allahabad, INDIA
AB  - Information Technology (IT) organizations are highly inspired to use the technological advancements in a rapid way to develop software products across different locations, irrespective of risk involved. Practitioners also readily grab the opportunities offered to showcase their talent, in spite of the difficulties they undergo. A global practitioner is exposed to risk in various phases of Global Software Development (GSD) due to the competitive environment he is in. Practitioner's risk affects the organization and is likely to result in project failure. Thus for successful completion of the project, it is essential to identify the risk in the various phases of GSD dynamically. This paper proposes a framework to dynamically assess the risk of the global practitioners using MultiAgent Simulation Model (MASM). Global practitioner agent and organizational agent are used in this work for risk assessment. This paper also explains a step-by-step risk assessment procedure. The risk level associated with each global practitioner is computed using two-valued binary logic and hence the risk associated with project completion is found using the probability equations.

AB  - Traditional simulators and simulation equipment are independent of the actual equipment, and the related training is on the operation of weapons and equipment. It is obviously that the function of simulation training is missing. The real feel and training effects cannot fully meet the training requirements of the actual equipment. This paper analyzes the development status of embedded simulation technology at home and abroad, and expounds the requirements of embedding the simulation system in actual equipment. It aims at multi-entity embedded simulation modeling, real-time online simulation, the simulation scheduling management of the real-time operating system, the management of data interaction, etc. The key issue is to study the architecture design of a multi-entity distributed embedded simulation system for practical exercises. It proposes an architecture design plan for an embedded simulation system which has an independent simulation function layer and facilitates the general development of simulation models. By building an embedded simulation verification environment that supports the air platform, we conduct simulation verification. The result shows that the system architecture have the ability of realizing multi-entity operation management, solving the problem of multi-entity simulation data interaction and management, and meeting the needs of supporting multi-entity distributed simulation.

AB  - There is a critical need for cost effective Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V). The goal of this research is to create a flexible tool that NASA IV&V can use to quantitatively assess the economic benefit of performing IV&V on NASA software development projects and to optimize that benefit across alternative IV&V plans. The tool is based on extensive research into Software Process Simulation Models (SPSMs) conducted at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) by Watts Humphrey, Marc Kellner, Bill Curtis, and others.SPSMs can be used to quantify the costs and benefits associated with NASA IV&V practices enabling management to effectively allocate scarce resources for IV&V activities. In addition, SPSMs facilitate the IV&V of NASA Software Development Processes by enabling checks and performance assessments.

TI  - Holistic Context-Sensitivity for Run-Time Optimization of Flexible Manufacturing Systems
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Highly flexible manufacturing systems require continuous run-time (self-) optimization of processes with respect to diverse parameters, e.g., efficiency, availability, energy consumption etc. A promising approach for achieving (self-) optimization in manufacturing systems is the usage of the context sensitivity approach based on data streaming from high amount of sensors and other data sources. Cyber-physical systems play an important role as sources of information to achieve context sensitivity. Cyber-physical systems can be seen as complex intelligent sensors providing data needed to identify the current context under which the manufacturing system is operating. In this paper, it is demonstrated how context sensitivity can be used to realize a holistic solution for (self-) optimization of discrete flexible manufacturing systems, by making use of cyber-physical systems integrated in manufacturing systems/processes. A generic approach for context sensitivity, based on self-learning algorithms, is proposed aiming at a various manufacturing systems. The new solution encompasses run-time context extractor and optimizer. Based on the self-learning module both context extraction and optimizer are continuously learning and improving their performance. The solution is following Service Oriented Architecture principles. The generic solution is developed and then applied to two very different manufacturing processes.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Winter Simulation Conference
CL  - Savannah, GA
AB  - Boeing Commercial Airplanes produces four twin-aisle airplane models at its Everett, Washington production facility-the largest building by volume in the world. Efficient and effective material handling of large airplane substructures is critical to maintain production rates, and the Everett facility employs two interconnected systems of overhead cranes to move airplane sections through the factory. The crane scheduling team needed a tool to evaluate current and proposed crane schedules for feasibility, rate capability, and potential bottlenecks. Boeing Research and Technology partnered with Simio LLC to develop a simulation model of the crane network that would execute and evaluate a series of crane moves. The model employs both discrete event and agent-based paradigms to model the complex system and to allow for highly configurable initial states. This approach allows for rapid schedule evaluation, non-recurring planning, and real-time system modeling. In this paper we present the system, the model, and results.

AB  - As Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are evolving towards flexible and smart systems, their dependable communication becomes a decisive factor. In order to still guarantee a predictive and real-time behavior, verifying the network performance of such adaptive systems is vital. Therefore, the performance-verification has to consider the runtime variability while scaling for larger number of applications and networks in CPS. We introduce a novel performance-verification approach with integrated variability enabling the analysis of adaptive Ethernet based CPS. It incorporates a formal model capturing all relevant characteristics for deriving safe communication bounds. Its soundness has been evaluated in an extensive automotive case study and several changing test setups targeting scalability. The results show that this integrated variability approach is superior to a common static analysis and previously utilized heuristic. In direct comparison it outperforms static analysis by up to 95 percent within the evaluated automotive system. Moreover, the results show that it scales well and provides a profound basis for analyzing larger adaptive networked systems.

TI  - Rate-Based Queueing Simulation Model of Open Source Software Debugging Activities
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Open source software (OSS) approach has become increasingly prevalent for software development. As the widespread utilization of OSS, the reliability of OSS products becomes an important issue. By simulating the testing and debugging processes of software life cycle, the rate-based queueing simulation model has shown its feasibility for closed source software (CSS) reliability assessment. However, the debugging activities of OSS projects are different in many ways from those of CSS projects and thus the simulation approach needs to be calibrated for OSS projects. In this paper, we first characterize the debugging activities of OSS projects. Based on this, we propose a new rate-based queueing simulation framework for OSS reliability assessment including the model and the procedures. Then a decision model is developed to determine the optimal version-updating time with respect to two objectives: minimizing the time for version update, and maximizing OSS reliability. To illustrate the proposed framework, three real datasets from Apache and GNOME projects are used. The empirical results indicate that our framework is able to effectively approximate the real scenarios. Moreover, the influences of the core contributor staffing levels are analyzed and the optimal version-updating times are obtained.

AB  - The development of complex systems often leads to delays in integration and roll-out, massive cost overruns, and in many cases to sub-optimal solutions regarding system performance and robustness. In order to overcome these issues, model-based systems engineering methodologies can be employed. The application of simulation models in addition to system specifications increase the engineers' understanding of complex system behavior. The approach also allows the detection of incomplete or inconsistent functional requirements as well as other design failures.With increasing complexity of system models it is necessary to optimize parameters to achieve a resource-efficient system. Indirect simulation is a well-known tool for this task, and there are numerous heuristics that can control the search in the parameter space. However, this task is much harder if the design parameters are not only numerical values from a predefined interval. In many cases the design issue (and optimization task) involves decisions about how a system architecture should be composed out of modules and interfaces / connections. In such cases, already the generation of feasible design variants may be hard to automate as a part of an optimization algorithm. Domain-specific knowledge and technical constraints have to be taken into account, and the non-numerical parameters have to be encoded such that they become accessible by the controlling heuristic.This paper presents a model-based methodology to optimize the architecture of a wireless sensor network that is designed for future avionic applications. We show how dynamically reconfigurable simulation models can be used to simplify an optimization of architecture or topology of a system. The system modeling and design tool MLDesigner is used for model implementation and simulations. In addition to that, the heuristic optimization process is described in such a model, thus controlling on a meta level the actual optimization. It can be changed or adapted easily, because it is not programmed but described with a high-level model.

TI  - Quantitative evaluation of model consistency evolution in compositional service-oriented simulation using a connected hyper-digraph
T2  - JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE C-COMPUTERS & ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Appropriate maintenance technologies that facilitate model consistency in distributed simulation systems are relevant but generally unavailable. To resolve this problem, we analyze the main factors that cause model inconsistency. The analysis methods used for traditional distributed simulations are mostly empirical and qualitative, and disregard the dynamic characteristics of factor evolution in model operational running. Furthermore, distributed simulation applications (DSAs) are rapidly evolving in terms of large-scale, distributed, service-oriented, compositional, and dynamic features. Such developments present difficulty in the use of traditional analysis methods in DSAs, for the analysis of factorial effects on simulation models. To solve these problems, we construct a dynamic evolution mechanism of model consistency, called the connected model hyper-digraph (CMH). CMH is developed using formal methods that accurately specify the evolutional processes and activities of models (i.e., self-evolution, interoperability, compositionality, and authenticity). We also develop an algorithm of model consistency evolution (AMCE) based on CMH to quantitatively and dynamically evaluate influencing factors. Experimental results demonstrate that non-combination (33.7% on average) is the most influential factor, non-single-directed understanding (26.6%) is the second most influential, and non-double-directed understanding (5.0%) is the least influential. Unlike previous analysis methods, AMCE provides good feasibility and effectiveness. This research can serve as guidance for designers of consistency maintenance technologies toward achieving a high level of consistency in future DSAs.

The model provides insights by exploiting the fundamental relationships between various components in an aerial robot, such as sensor framerate, compute performance, and body dynamics (physics). F-1 serves as a tool that can aid computer and cyber-physical system architects to understand the optimal design (or selection) of various components in the development of autonomous machines.

TI  - Towards a taxonomy of technical debt for COTS-intensive cyber physical systems
T2  - 17TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS ENGINEERING RESEARCH (CSER)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 17th Annual Conference on Systems Engineering Research (CSER)
CL  - Washington, DC
AB  - Most existing studies addressing COTS obsolescence issues in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) have strong emphasis on the sustainment phases. We have identified a gap on methods, processes, and tools for effective COTS risk analysis in the early systems acquisition phases. To fill the gap, this study proposes a taxonomy of COTS-related technical debt in order to support early identification, communication, and assessment of obsolescence risks in CPS system engineering life cycles. The taxonomy contributes to the identification of seven key types of COTS technical debt according to systematic signs discoverable during early COTS activities, which may contribute to obsolescence in later phases. These seven types of COTS technical debt include COTS functionality mismatch, performance mismatch, interoperability difficulty, versioning frequency, documentation and support readiness, and limitation on system evolution. It is expected that such notions will help to increase the efficiency of COTS-based CPS development, readiness, and sustainment, through more informed COTS decision-making to avoid expensive and unaffordable obsolescence issues in the envisioned systems sustainment phases.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The design and development of large-scale software projects is a complex endeavor, often facing problems like cost and schedule overruns as well as low quality. Over the last years the management of software development projects has been recognized as the cornerstone point of seeking improvement and solutions. Simulation modeling of the software project process is gaining interest among academics and practitioners, as a method to tackle the complex questions with which relevant enterprises are confronted. It offers support on several issues, such as defining software product development strategies, decision-making regarding process improvement and training, in a time span ranging from a short portion of the life cycle to long term product evolution, with organization-wide implications. The aim of this work is to implement a model simulating a core part of a software project process, enabling the estimation of several project development details such as delivery times and quality metrics. The purpose of the model is to assist project managers in control and monitoring, but also in identifying the best planning alternatives. The model scope covers a portion of the life cycle of an incremental software development venture. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This is the first such program in the US that also has an ABET accredited general engineering curriculum. Students will receive a B.E. in Software Engineering Degree, and be prepared to sit for the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) examination [2]. In addition to its strong engineering foundation, the program benefits from the success of the Stevens graduate program in software engineering.This paper describes the program: the motivation, the curriculum, the program assessment plan, the early challenges, and the results to date, including some consideration as a potential model of an undergraduate Cyber-Physical Systems Engineering curriculum.

T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Smart infrastructure has the potential to revolutionise how infrastructure is delivered, managed and automatically controlled. Data and digital twins offer an opportunity to enable this revolution and secure sustainable future smart infrastructure. In this article, we discuss data as an engineering tool and propose to use data throughout the asset's whole life cycle from identifying the need, planning and designing to construction, operation, integration and maintenance. This requires systems thinking where focus is not limited to the problems but rather constructs a systemic perspective to understand the interrelationships between components and systems. Future infrastructure is connected, intelligent and data-driven. To enable more sustainable decision-making, we should not only consider how to integrate different infrastructure elements but also use data to monitor, learn from and inform decisions. To this end, we present a case study where several assets, such as bridges, railways and transport systems are integrated, and data are curated for the purpose of aiding climate-conscious, sustainable decision-making. An example systems architecture for integration of different digital twins is explained and benefits of this data-driven, systemic perspective are discussed.

AB  - In the process of developing Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems, simulation has proved to be an essential tool for the evaluation of existing and conceived P2P systems. So far, in practice, there has been a clear separation between a simulation model of a P2P system and a real P2P system that operates on a real physical network. This separation hinders the transition of models to real systems and the evaluation of already deployed systems by means of simulation.To bridge this gap, we put forward the idea of simulation-based development of P2P systems. In this approach, an initial simulation model of a P2P system is iteratively transformed into the intended real P2P system. As a concretion of this approach, we propose a methodology and a framework for the simulation-based development of P2P systems. The presented framework effectively supports a developer in modelling, simulating and ultimately developing P2P systems. We demonstrate the validity of our approach and the framework by constructing an example P2P application. This application is simulated in a series of experiments as well as deployed in a large-scale internet-based P2P system. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Testing cyber-physical system (CPS) development tools such as MathWorks' Simulink is very important as they are widely used in design, simulation, and verification of CPS data-flow models. Existing randomized differential testing frameworks such as SLforge leverages semi-formal Simulink specifications to guide random model generation which requires significant research and engineering investment along with the need to manually update the tool, whenever MathWorks updates model validity rules. To address the limitations, we propose to learn validity rules automatically by learning a language model using our framework DeepFuzzSL from existing corpus of Simulink models. In our experiments, DeepFuzzSL consistently generate over 90% valid Simulink models and also found 2 confirmed bugs by MathWorks Support.

TI  - Integrating heterogeneous engineering knowledge and tools for efficient industrial simulation model support
T2  - ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Design of simulation models and their integration into industrial automation systems require knowledge from several heterogeneous data sources and tools. Due to the heterogeneity of engineering data, the integration of the tools and data are time-consuming and error-prone tasks nowadays. The key goal of this article is to provide an effective and efficient integration of heterogeneous data sources and tools as a knowledge basis to support dynamic simulation for industrial plants. The integrated knowledge is utilized both (i) in the design phase of simulation models for defining structure and interfaces of the models and (ii) in the runtime phase of industrial systems for model-driven configuration of the integrated environment. Reaching such goals with a manual approach or point-to-point integration is not beneficial as it may be possible for a few tools and data sources, but quickly gets very complex. A growing number of elements increases the risk of errors and the effort needed for integration. The proposed solution is based on a specification of a common data model to represent engineering knowledge and a service-oriented tool integration with the Engineering Service Bus. Engineering knowledge is integrated in a knowledge base implemented with ontologies in Web Ontology Language-Description Logic (OWL-DL). The proposed approach is demonstrated and evaluated on an educational hydraulic system. Major results of the article are: (i) a data model to represent engineering knowledge for dynamic industrial systems, (ii) the integration platform that, based on this model, integrates the tools for system design and runtime, and (iii) basic design-time and runtime processes for the integrated industrial simulations.

TI  - Evaluating Variability Modeling Techniques for Supporting Cyber-Physical System Product Line Engineering
T2  - SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND MODELING: TECHNOLOGY-SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF MODELS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th International Conference on System Analysis and Modeling (SAM)
CL  - Saint Melo, FRANCE
AB  - Modern society is increasingly dependent on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) in diverse domains such as aerospace, energy and health-care. Employing Product Line Engineering (PLE) in CPSs is cost-effective in terms of reducing production cost, and achieving high productivity of a CPS development process as well as higher quality of produced CPSs. To apply CPS PLE in practice, one needs to first select an appropriate variability modeling technique (VMT), with which variabilities of a CPS Product Line (PL) can be specified. In this paper, we proposed a set of basic and CPS-specific variation point (VP) types and modeling requirements for proposing CPS-specific VMTs. Based on the proposed set of VP types (basic and CPS-specific) and modeling requirements, we evaluated four VMTs: Feature Modeling, Cardinality Based Feature Modeling, Common Variability Language, and SimPL (a variability modeling technique dedicated to CPS PLE), with a real-world case study. Evaluation results show that none of the selected VMTs can capture all the basic and CPS-specific VP and meet all the modeling requirements. Therefore, there is a need to extend existing techniques or propose new ones to satisfy all the requirements.

AB  - Falsification is a popular simulation-based testing method for Cyber-Physical Systems to find inputs that violate a formal requirement. However, detecting violations considering multiple probabilistic requirements simultaneously with a dense space of changing factors in the execution scenario is an open problem. We address this problem by proposing a novel approach that combines parametric model checking and many-objective optimization. Results of a preliminary empirical evaluation show the effectiveness of the approach compared to selected baseline methods.

TI  - Tuning self-adaptation in cyber-physical systems through architectural homeostasis
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Self-adaptive software-intensive cyber-physical systems (sasiCPS) encounter a high level of run-time uncertainty. State-of-the-art architecture-based self-adaptation approaches assume designing against a fixed set of situations that warrant self-adaptation. As a result, failures may appear when sasiCPS operate in environment conditions they are not specifically designed for. In response, we propose to increase the homeostasis of sasiCPS, i.e., the capacity to maintain an operational state despite run-time uncertainty, by introducing run-time changes to the architecture-based self-adaptation strategies according to environment stimuli. In addition to articulating the main idea of architectural homeostasis, we introduce four mechanisms that reify the idea: (i) collaborative sensing, (ii) faulty component isolation from adaptation, (iii) enhancing mode switching, and (iv) adjusting guards in mode switching. Moreover, our experimental evaluation of the four mechanisms in two different case studies confirms that allowing a complex system to change its self-adaptation strategies helps the system recover from run-time errors and abnormalities and keep it in an operational state.

TI  - An Attacker Modeling Framework for the Assessment of Cyber-Physical Systems Security
T2  - COMPUTER SAFETY, RELIABILITY, AND SECURITY, SAFECOMP 2020
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 39th International Conference on Computer Safety, Reliability and Security (SAFECOMP)
CL  - Lisbon, PORTUGAL
AB  - Characterizing attacker behavior with respect to Cyber-Physical Systems is important to assuring the security posture and resilience of these systems. Classical cyber vulnerability assessment approaches rely on the knowledge and experience of cyber-security experts to conduct security analyses and can be inconsistent where the experts' knowledge and experience are lacking. This paper proposes a flexible attacker modeling framework that aids in the security analysis process by simulating a diverse set of attacker behaviors to predict attack progression and provide consistent system vulnerability analysis. The model proposes an expanded architecture of vulnerability databases to maximize its effectiveness and consistency in detecting CPS vulnerabilities while being compatible with existing vulnerability databases. The model has the power to be implemented and simulated against an actual or virtual CPS. Execution of the attacker model is demonstrated against a simulated industrial control system architecture, resulting in a probabilistic prediction of attacker behavior.

AB  - Future intelligent management systems compose of heterogeneous devices with lots of applications cooperatively to analyze data. Recent advances in Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) provide opportunities for solving this challenge with reusability, composability, and abstraction. In this paper, we develop an intelligent management platform using cloud computing and SOA. It provides different service modules to collect, store, analyze, and visualize the Internet of Things (IoT) data to fit Cyber-Physical System (CPS), all these functions are wrapped as RESTful APIs so it can be imported to other applications, making the same service can be reused to meet the requirements of different fields. In addition, an editable dynamic dashboard service is proposed to personalize the management demand in a click-and-drag way. Users can analyze and observe data for intelligent management. Finally, we apply these services to build three different applications to validate the power of our service platform.

CL  - Nizhny Novgorod, RUSSIA
AB  - Measuring the value of IT is always a challenge for investors. Market share for service oriented Information Systems (IS) is constantly growing and it creates the demand for methods of measuring the value of SOA-based IS projects. This research is aimed at adopting existing IT Project assessment methods to this growing demand. The work proposes the method that considers the fact that SOA-based IS deployment and evolution could be split in separate flows, one per service. It will allow usage of individual discount rate values per service since project risk values should be different for different services. It should make project value assessment more accurate comparing to existing methods which use the single flow for the entire project. This research also proposes Real Options for calculating the flexibility fraction of the value. The developed method was verified using own simulation model. Both developed method and the simulation model were applied to value assessment of a real-world project.

T2  - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING FOR RESILIENT SYSTEMS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th International Workshop on Software Engineering for Resilient Systems (SERENE)
CL  - Budapest, HUNGARY
AB  - The obvious growth of complexity in embedded and cyber physical systems requires from developers to be innovative in the way they carry out the verification process. To increase the amount of information available from a system, software instrumentation has been previously used in these domains, therefore solving the problem of observability. In addition, as this kind of systems tends to be increasingly involved in safety critical and dependable applications, ensuring reliability properties must also be considered as a part of the verification process. In this paper, the system observability problem is initially being introduced. Then, as a solution to overcome the previous limitation, instrumentation is being explored. To address the verification concerns of resilient systems, a three components model is designed, the latter explicitly defining degradation and compensation models to capture the resiliency routine. Finally, to conclude the models definition, a handful number of LTL properties are identified and discussed.

TI  - A Simplified Model of the HVDC Transmission System for Sub-Synchronous Oscillations
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - As the installed capacity of the power system is scaled up and the distance of transmission increases constantly, high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission technology has been widely applied across the power system. The HVDC system can lead to sub-synchronous oscillations (SSO) in the turbine and new energy generation systems. When the SSO caused by HVDC are studied through small signal analysis, it is usually necessary to establish the detailed state space model and electromagnetic transient model, which shows various disadvantages such as the high complexity of the model, the high order of the state space matrix, the complex calculation of eigenvalues, and the slow pace of simulation. In the present study, a simplified model intended for the HVDC transmission system is proposed, which can be used to simplify the calculation model and accelerate the simulation by omitting the high-frequency component and simultaneously keeping the sub-synchronous frequency component unchanged. The time domain simulation method is used to compare the dynamic response of the proposed simplified simulation model with that of the original detailed model, and the accuracy of the proposed model is demonstrated. The proposed simplified simulation model is applied to explore the SSO of wind-thermal power bundling in the HVDC transmission system. Additionally, the simulation results of SSO are compared by using the simplified model and the detailed model; the results of which demonstrate the effectiveness and rapidity of the simplified simulation model. The simplified model proposed can greatly improve the efficiency of SSO risk assessment. By selecting reasonable types and parameters of new energy units, SSO of the system can be avoided under risky operation mode, and the power grid operation mode can be monitored and adjusted to ensure the safe operation of the system. Finally, it can promote the sustainable development of the power system.

AB  - During the last decade software process simulation has been used to address a wide diversity of management problems. Some of these problems are related to strategic management, technology adoption, understanding, training and learning, and risk management, among others. In this work a dynamic integrated framework for software process improvement is presented. This framework combines traditional estimation static models with an intensive utilization of dynamic simulation models of the software process. The aim of this framework is to support a qualitative and quantitative assessment for software process improvement and decision making to achieve a higher software development process capability according to the Capability Maturity Model. The paper describes the concepts underlying this framework, its implementation, the dynamic approach followed to systematically develop the dynamic modules, and an example of its potential use and benefits.

AB  - One of the key architecture-related activities is the evaluation of the architecture drivers and design, and simulation is one mean to automatically assess architecture-significant aspects such as performance. Despite the maturity of the existing architecture specification and simulation techniques, the proper simulation of architecture models is still effort-intensive and time-consuming. This is caused by the usual informality of the architecture specification on the one hand, and by the formalisms required for proper execution of architecture simulations on the other hand. To bridge this gap, we present in this paper a semi-automated approach to support the specification and simulation of architecture drivers and design. The approach has been used in different industrial projects in the field of transportation and smart factories. In this paper, we present an anonymized example centered on the security of software deployment and execution in the transportation domain.

TI  - SFTA-Based Approach for Safety/Reliability Analysis of Operational Use-Cases in Cyber-Physical Systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The software is often responsible for controlling the behavior of mechanical and electrical components, as well as interactions among these components in cyber-physical systems (CPS). The risks in CPS systems could result in losing tools, features, performance and even life. Therefore, safety analysis for software in these systems is a highly critical and serious issue. In general, safety and reliability approaches play a major role in a risk management process in CPS. In this paper, after reviewing the major techniques of software reliability and safety in CPS, an software fault tree analysis (SFTA)-based approach is presented for analysis of operational use-cases (UC) in a CPS system. In our approach, the events related to use-cases are extracted, and the related SFTA is then obtained using the proposed algorithm. Moreover, a semi-automatic method is presented in this paper to produce software failure mode and effects analysis (SFMEA) from SFTA. The results of our approach are applicable for software safety analysis in a real CPS system, including the control system of Iranian National Observatory telescope. Assessment of the suggested method is performed through numerous safety/reliability criteria and the qualitative/quantitative analysis based on these criteria.

AB  - The resilience of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is of major public concern, but is an ill-defined property that is challenging to engineer, given the complexity and multi-disciplinarity of CPSs. Co-simulation techniques are therefore attractive options, permitting cross domain analysis of cyber and physical failures, as well as their prevention, detection and tolerance. We propose the use of a multi-attribute resilience profile as a basis for assessment and trade-off analysis in CPSs. We propose augmentations to the INTO-CPS methods that explicitly use this profile to analyse resilience by means of co-simulation at several design stages. A small pilot study shows how such methods may help the CPS engineer to identify and evaluate new resilient designs.

AB  - This tutorial is based on the book with the same title, published by Springer, 2009. The tutorial presents an introduction to object oriented simulation modeling and using the OOSimL simulation language for implementing the simulation models. The emphasis is on early introduction to simulation because simulation is considered an important area in the computing curricula.An overview of relevant object-oriented modeling principles and then an introduction to object-oriented modeling and simulation using the process interaction approach with the new language, OOSimL. In addition to the simulation concepts, a brief exposure is included to developing models with the Eclipse integrated development environment. The simulation language was designed and developed for teaching OO simulation early in undergraduate programs in computing. Object orientation enhances the modeling and implementation of various families of systems. The OOSimL compiler generates Java code and C++ code. This simulation language was designed and developed for teaching OO simulation to students of computing (Computer Science, Software Engineering, and related disciplines). The language supports and promotes standard object-oriented (and software engineering) concepts and principles.

AB  - Internal and external factors that influence reliability of CPSs are analyzed in this paper. A strategy for reliability testing and evaluation of CPSs is put forward in the consideration of these factors, including the technology framework and processes. The main work comprises the testing and evaluation of component reliability covering hardware, software, and architecture, as well as the performance reliability including service reliability, cyber security reliability, resilience & elasticity reliability and vulnerability reliability. To give a general look of the system reliability, the four indices of performance reliability are synthesized by the multi-index method. The strategy proposed in the paper will make a great contribution to the complete, dynamic and continuous testing and evaluation for the CPS.

AB  - The steady progression of the digital transformation within all business sectors and society thrive the importance of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), whereas their areas of application grow and expand to an unmanageable amount. Since the model-based engineering concept has been used for an integral part of CPSs, i.e., embedded devices, these methodologies should be carefully assessed, whether they still can be applied to design the emerging CPSs and to which extent. Accordingly, we first identify the specific challenges of CPSs. We then benchmark the established model-based engineering concepts concerning the identified challenges. In order to address the identified critical deficiencies and weaknesses, we propose to adopt carefully selected methods and strategies from the cyber-space domain as well as approaches followed by science and industry. Consequently, we propose a tailored engineering framework for CPS design, which represents a blueprint for future CPS projects. Our blueprint combines the strengths of the analyzed methods and concepts from all three domains - model-based, cyber-space engineering and currently available solutions or strategies.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 5th IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Software Engineering for Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (SEsCPS)
CL  - Montreal, CANADA
AB  - Model-driven approaches in developing and operating Cyber-Physical Systems are increasingly complemented by data-driven methods. Examples for their use cases are the analysis of model repositories for discovering patterns and relationships in models, the design-time learning of approximate system and environment models from data, and the detection of divergence from design-time assumptions during operations. In this paper we argue that model- and data-driven approaches have combined use cases that that need complementary services provided by modeling and data analytic frameworks. However, convergence of model-driven and data-driven methods is hindered by the strongly different tool infrastructure. The paper summarizes the integration challenges and proposes a semantic bridge as a solution for filling the gap between the model - and data-driven tool suites.

AB  - This article through simulation provides the functioning mathematical model of information security system (ISS) from unauthorized access (UAA) in automated systems (AS). The model is developed in CPN Tools software environment for its analysis, getting probabilistic-temporal characteristics and its further comparison with the analytical model. The systematic analysis of functional components in ISS from UAA highlighted its key subsystems. Integrated CPN Tools breaks the model into subsystems by preserving ISS functioning logics from UAA, and observes the taking processes. This model performs the computation experiment, namely, researches ISS real consumer properties from UAA in AS, which in following researches provides the analysis software complex development and qualitative assessment of the similar systems functioning. Simulation results of ISS functioning process from UAA in AS can be various characteristics of each state, describing the system work both generally and for its subsystems. The programming Metalanguage, used in CPN Tools adjusts the simulation model and controls the marker random transition from the initial state to final through intermediate, determines transition properties, enters different marker types, sets time delays, etc. The article substantiates the required transitions by ISS simulation model from UAA in AS to get reliable characteristics as the further research direction.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 12th IEEE/IFIP/ACM International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM)
CL  - Ecole Technologie Superiere, Montreal, CANADA
AB  - Predicting Web service response time percentiles is often an important aspect of service level management exercises. Existing techniques can be very time consuming since they involve the manual construction of complex analytic or simulation models. To address this problem, we propose Prospective, a fully automated and data-driven approach for predicting Web service response time percentiles. Prospective relies on historical response time data collected from a Web service. Given a specification for workload expected at the Web service over a planning horizon, Prospective uses this historical data to offer predictions for response time percentiles of interest. At the core of Prospective is a lightweight simulator that uses collaborative filtering to estimate response time behaviour of the service based on behaviour observed historically. Results show that Prospective is able to predict various response time percentiles of interest with high accuracy for a wide variety of workloads.

AB  - This study is about the process of designing and implementing a low-cost flight simulator as a complex system. Its main objective has been targeted to be the training of pilots in order to improve aircraft control skills. For this purpose, the simulator has been developed using a Cyber Physical Systems approach and a mechatronics design methodology. In addition, software design techniques have been used for cybernetic components. The mechatronic system consists of mechanical, electrical and electronic elements, such as three actuators that control the Stewart platform in real time, controlling movements of up, down, left and right. These have been integrated with software consisting of a virtual flight system that manages the control, communication and animation of the airplane from the mathematics of models implemented with a Unity 3D Engine in a network of computers. Extreme Programming as an agile methodology has been used to guarantee the quality of the software. The validation of the proposed solution has been performed with several professional pilots trained with the Microsoft Flight Simulator. The results demonstrated that this flight simulator supports the development of aircraft control skills leading to an increase of their abilities.

AB  - Self-healing is becoming an essential behavior of smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), which enables them to recover from faults by themselves. Such behaviors make decisions autonomously at runtime and they often operate in an uncertain physical environment making testing even more challenging. To this end, we propose Fragility-Oriented Testing (FOT), which relies on model execution and reinforcement learning to cost-effectively test self-healing behaviors of CPSs in the presence of environmental uncertainty. We evaluated FOT's performance by comparing it with a Coverage-Oriented Testing (COT) algorithm. Evaluation results show that FOT significantly outperformed COT for testing nine self-healing behaviors implemented in three case studies. On average, FOT managed to find 80% more faults than COT and for cases when both FOT and COT found the same faults, FOT took on average 50% less time than COT.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - European Simulation and Modelling Conference (ESM 2003)
CL  - Consiglio Reg Campania, Naples, ITALY
AB  - The current generation of network-centric applications exhibits an increasingly higher degree of mobility. Wireless networks allow devices to move from one location to another without loosing connectivity. Also, new software technologies allow code fragments or entire running applications to migrate from one host to another. Performance modeling of such complex systems is a difficult task, which should be earned out during the early design stages of system development. However, the integration of performance modeling analysis with software system specification for mobile systems is still an open problem, since there is no unique widely accepted notation for describing mobile systems. Moreover performance modeling is usually developed separately from high-level system description. This is not only time consuming, but the separation of performance model and system specification makes more difficult the feedback process of reporting the performance analysis results at the system design level, and modifying system model to analyze design alternatives. In this paper we address the problem of integrating system performance modeling and analysis with a specification of mobile software system based on UML. In particular we introduce a unified UML notation for high-level description and performance modeling of mobile systems. The notation allows inclusion of quantitative information, which are used to build a process-oriented simulation model of the system. The simulation model is executed, and the results are reported back in the UML notation. We describe a prototype tool for translating annotated UML models into simulation programs and we present a simple case study.

TI  - Towards DevOps for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs): Resilient Self-Adaptive Software for Sustainable Human-Centric Smart CPS Facilitated by Digital Twins
T2  - MACHINES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Industrial Revolution drives the digitization of society and industry, entailing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) that form ecosystems where system owners and third parties share responsibilities within and across industry domains. Such ecosystems demand smart CPSs that continuously align their architecture and governance to the concerns of various stakeholders, including developers, operators, and users. In order to satisfy short- and long-term stakeholder concerns in a continuously evolving operational context, this work proposes self-adaptive software models that promote DevOps for smart CPS. Our architectural approach extends to the embedded system layer and utilizes embedded and interconnected Digital Twins to manage change effectively. Experiments conducted on industrial embedded control units demonstrate the approach's effectiveness in achieving sub-millisecond real-time closed-loop control of CPS assets and the simultaneous high-fidelity twinning (i.e., monitoring) of asset states. In addition, the experiments show practical support for the adaptation and evolution of CPS through the dynamic reconfiguring and updating of real-time control services and communication links without downtime. The evaluation results conclude that, in particular, the embedded Digital Twins can enhance CPS smartness by providing service-oriented access to CPS data, monitoring, adaptation, and control capabilities. Furthermore, the embedded Digital Twins can facilitate the seamless integration of these capabilities into current and future industrial service ecosystems. At the same time, these capabilities contribute to implementing emerging industrial services such as remote asset monitoring, commissioning, and maintenance.

AB  - This paper presents a methodology to aid the development of multi-agent cyber-physical systems. The software architecture is structured in a multi-layer fashion, distributed on different devices (agents), making its design very challenging. A methodology is thus needed to meet the performance goal of such a system. The proposed methodology relies on Model-Based Software Design techniques, and on the Model/Software/Hardware-In-The-Loop (MIL, SIL, HIL) simulations. In particular, the HIL verification technique, which is widely adopted in the automotive and avionic industry also in the early development phases as a Computer-Aided Design tool, is the core tool of the real-time performances assessment verification. To speed-up the development process, and to obtain a toolchain coherent with the proposed approach, the adoption of a Model-Based Software Design methodology represents an optimal solution. Within those assumptions, we propose a benchmark of the methodology, applied on a customized multi-agent system. The aim is to prove that the proposed method is able to achieve and verify a set of real-time requirements on the system behavior.

TI  - On Data Integrity Attacks Against Real-Time Pricing in Energy-Based Cyber-Physical Systems
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we investigate a novel real-time pricing scheme, which considers both renewable energy resources and traditional power resources and could effectively guide the participants to achieve individual welfare maximization in the system. To be specific, we develop a Lagrangian-based approach to transform the global optimization conducted by the power company into distributed optimization problems to obtain explicit energy consumption, supply, and price decisions for individual participants. Also, we show that these distributed problems derived from the global optimization by the power company are consistent with individual welfare maximization problems for end-users and traditional power plants. We also investigate and formalize the vulnerabilities of the real-time pricing scheme by considering two types of data integrity attacks: Ex-ante attacks and Ex-post attacks, which are launched by the adversary before or after the decision-making process. We systematically analyze the welfare impacts of these attacks on the real-time pricing scheme. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and performance evaluation, our data shows that the real-time pricing scheme could effectively guide the participants to achieve welfare maximization, while cyber-attacks could significantly disrupt the results of real-time pricing decisions, imposing welfare reduction on the participants.

AB  - In this article, a microservice architecture of cyber-physical space was considered and in particular localization service was implemented. We propose an architecture of proactive localization service, which allows predicting the activity of the tracked object in cyber-physical space. To solve the position prediction problem, we tested machine learning methods and contrasted the results of the trained models. Three machine learning algorithms were tested (artificial neural network, random forest, and decision tree) with two different datasets. The reason of high/low prediction accuracy were identified. As a result of testing, the best result has neural network. In this case mean absolute error is 8.2 and 11.7 m respectively for dataset No1 and and No2, while random forest has 13 and 14 m error. The architecture of the service was developed using containerization technologies and special tools for their deployment and management.

T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article focuses on the design of safe and attack-resilient Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) equipped with multiple sensors measuring the same physical variable. A malicious attacker may be able to disrupt system performance through compromising a subset of these sensors. Consequently, we develop a precise and resilient sensor fusion algorithm that combines the data received from all sensors by taking into account their specified precisions. In particular, we note that in the presence of a shared bus, in which messages are broadcast to all nodes in the network, the attacker's impact depends on what sensors he has seen before sending the corrupted measurements. Therefore, we explore the effects of communication schedules on the performance of sensor fusion and provide theoretical and experimental results advocating for the use of the Ascending schedule, which orders sensor transmissions according to their precision starting from the most precise. In addition, to improve the accuracy of the sensor fusion algorithm, we consider the dynamics of the system in order to incorporate past measurements at the current time. Possible ways of mapping sensor measurement history are investigated in the article and are compared in terms of the confidence in the final output of the sensor fusion. We show that the precision of the algorithm using history is never worse than the no-history one, while the benefits may be significant. Furthermore, we utilize the complementary properties of the two methods and show that their combination results in a more precise and resilient algorithm. Finally, we validate our approach in simulation and experiments on a real unmanned ground robot.

AB  - Because of the complex production processes and technology-intensive operations that take place in the aerospace and defense industry, introducing Industry 4.0 into the manufacturing processes of aircraft composite materials is inevitable. Digital Twin and Cyber-Physical Systems in Industry 4.0 are key techniques to develop digital manufacturing. Since it is very difficult to create high-fidelity virtual models, the development of digital manufacturing for aircraft manufacturers is challenging. In this study, we provide a view from a data simulation perspective and adopt machine learning approaches to simplify the high-fidelity virtual models in Digital Twin. The novel concept is called Data Twin, and the deployable service to support the simulation is known as the Data Twin Service (DTS). Relying on the DTS, we also propose a microservice software architecture, Cyber-Physical Factory (CPF), to simulate the shop floor environment. Additionally, there are two war rooms in the CPF that can be used to establish a collaborative platform: one is the Physical War Room, used to integrate real data, and the other is the Cyber War Room for handling simulation data and the results of the CPF.

AB  - ATM has been accepted by CCITT as the world-wide standard technique to provide B-ISDN services. The traditional switching architectures developed for conventional circuit and packet switching are not well suited to ATM. Therefore, the need far performance evaluation of ATM switching architectures arises as a complement to the design and analysis of such systems. A large number of ATM switching architectures has been proposed over the last few years. Nevertheless, as far as the authors know, there are little or no description about the simulation models and tools adopted to analyze these switching systems. This paper is aimed to present and describe, under a practical point of view, a discrete-event simulator designed to evaluate the performance of ATM switches subject to different architectures and traffic patterns.

AB  - The need to interact with complex environments that are often not well understood at design time makes the development of smart cyber-physical systems (sCPS) a challenging endeavor. We propose a set of practices and tools that support the design and implementation of sCPS using continuous collaboration-a development lifecycle and architecture to continuously incorporate data gained from the operation of the sCPS into the system. Continuous collaboration attempts to harmonize three interlocking feedback cycles: refinement of the system design by the developers, autonomous evolution of agents in the sCPS, and feedback from the evolving system to the developers. To support the process we introduce tools and techniques that we have found helpful to realize continuous collaboration: The HADES/Hexameter platform, extended behavior trees and the teacher/student learning pattern.

This approach allows the designer to make decisions concerning the power system architecture and its components. This paper is focused on the techniques to identify topology candidates that can be built with available voltage regulator technologies and find the solution with best trade-off among energy efficiency, size and cost. In order to solve the problem when the number of possible options is very large, metaheuristic algorithms are used.

AB  - This paper puts forward a PASCAL simulation model to evaluate the performance of three access policy protocols for replicated files in distributed systems. The three protocols are: static majority consensus voting, dynamic voting and lexicographic dynamic voting. The main objective of these protocols is to ensure the consistency of data in replicated files of distributed systems. The results show that lexicographic dynamic voting performs better than majority consensus and dynamic voting for all cases under study. The dynamic voting outperformed the majority consensus voting when there are four or more copies; the reverse is true when there are three copies. Also, it is found that adding a fourth copy to a basic set of three under the majority consensus voting reduces file availability; whereas adding a fifth copy improves the availability.

AB  - Due to the increasing importance of cyber-physical and embedded systems in industry, there is a strong demand for engineers with an updated knowledge on contemporary technology and methods in the area. This is a challenge for educators, in particular when it comes to creating hands-on experiences of real systems, due to their complexity and the fact that they are usually proprietary. Therefore, a laboratory environment that is representative of the industrial solutions is needed, with a focus on software and systems engineering issues. This paper describes such an environment, called the Mobile Open Platform for Experimental Design (MOPED). It consists of a model car chassis, equipped with a network of three control units based on standard hardware, and running the automotive software standard AUTOSAR, which consists of operating system, middleware, and application software structures. It is equipped with various sensors and actuators, and is open to extensions both in hardware and software. It also contains elements of future systems, since it allows connectivity to cloud services, development of federated embedded systems, and continuous deployment of new functionality. In this way, the platform provides a very relevant learning environment for cyber-physical systems, today and in the future.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Current e-learning systems are increasing their importance in higher education. However, the state of the art of e-learning applications, besides the state of the practice, does not achieve the level of interactivity that current learning theories advocate. In this paper, the possibility of enhancing e-learning systems to achieve deep learning has been studied by replicating an experiment in which students had to learn basic software engineering principles. One group learned these principles using a static approach, while the other group learned the same principles using a system-dynamics-based approach, which provided interactivity and feedback. The results show that, quantitatively, the latter group achieved a better understanding of the principles; furthermore, qualitatively, they enjoyed the learning experience.

TI  - Formal assessment of reliability specifications in embedded cyber-physical systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED LOGIC
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliability has become an integral component of the design, intent of embedded cyber-physical systems. Safety-critical embedded systems are designed with specific reliability targets, and design practices include the appropriate allocation of both spatial and temporal redundancies in the implementation to meet such requirements. With increasing complexity of such systems and considering the large number of components in such systems, redundancy allocation requires a formal scientific basis. In this work, we profess the analysis of the redundancy requirement upfront with the objective of making it an integral part of the specification. The underlying problem is one of synthesizing a formal specification with built-in redundancy artifacts, from the formal properties of the error-free system, the error probabilities of the control components, and the reliability target. We believe that upfront formal analysis of redundancy requirements is important in budgeting the resource requirements from a cost versus reliability perspective. Several case-studies from the automotive domain highlight the efficacy of our proposal. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Probabilistic Design of Systems of Cyber-Physical Systems
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Cyber-physical systems are engineered systems that rely on a tight integration of computational algorithms and physical components. Such systems are becoming increasingly important in modern society. Examples include smart home and office appliances, robotics, modern manufacturing equipment, medical devices, and automobiles. In many cases, these systems are connected to Internet and form an interconnected system, often referred to as the Internet of Things, with advanced capabilities to sense the environment, exchange information, and interact with humans. Given the rising importance of systems of cyber-physical systems in engineering, business, and social environments, improvements in their design can have major impacts on society. One challenge in designing such systems is to ensure the system is resilient, meaning that it can recover from major disruptions when a portion of the system fails to function or communicate. Another challenge is how to take social behaviors into consideration in their design so that people will feel comfortable to use such systems because they constantly collect and share our information. The goal of this research is to understand how to systematically design networked systems of cyber-physical systems such that they are resilient and trustable. This will include new techniques for measuring key properties of complex systems as well as techniques to design them with better performance. Results will be shared, in part, through open-source software created during this research to help engineers design better systems. Web-based learning modules about cyber-physical systems intended for the general public also will be created and shared broadly.The objective of this project is to create and demonstrate a probabilistic design methodology for networked and deeply interdependent cyber-physical systems that incorporates meta-modeling and discrete-event fine-grained modeling. The methodology will enable the design of system-of-system architecture that addresses functionalities of information gathering and exchange under the challenges of resiliency, adaptability, and trust. An information-based quantitative performance measure for resilience will be created. Mathematical models will be formulated to analyze the information interdependency between individuals. Quantitative measures of trustworthiness will be developed to support trust-based strategic network design and optimization. These novel approaches will be demonstrated and evaluated in a design study of highly networked manufacturing machines in supply chains.

AB  - Powertrain control calibration is an essential stage before the delivery of final products, to ensure that a vehicle works well in all driving environments. However, due to complexity of a powertrain control system (often as many as 40,000 parameters), it is difficult to assess when all parameters are fully calibrated. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore an approach to evaluate and predict the maturity level of powertrain control software based on calibration data for simulation models. We developed metrics that indicate software maturity and their visualization using heatmaps. We used software maturity growth curves to select maturity growth models for maturity assessment. The results and approaches of this paper were validated with theoretical methods and empirical methods using action research techniques. Our conclusions show that we can use standard software reliability growth models to monitor the calibration process for powertrain software, and we conclude that this type of monitoring provides a good support for quality stakeholders in monitoring powertrain calibration quality.

AB  - Cyber-physical control systems, such as industrial control systems (ICS), are increasingly targeted by cyberattacks. Such attacks can potentially cause tremendous damage, affect critical infrastructure or even jeopardize human life when the system does not behave as intended. Cyberattacks, however, are not new and decades of security research have developed plenty of solutions to thwart them. Unfortunately, many of these solutions cannot be easily applied to safety-critical cyber-physical systems. Further, the attack surface of ICS is quite different from what can be commonly assumed in classical IT systems.We present SCADMAN, a novel control-logic aware anomaly detection system for distributed cyber-physical systems. By observing the system-wide behavior, the correctness of individual controllers (like programmable logic controllers-PLCs) in ICS can be verified. This allows SCADMAN to detect a wide range of attacks, including malware attacks, code-reuse and data-only attacks, as well as sensor attacks. We implemented and evaluated SCADMAN based on a real-world water treatment testbed for ICS security research and training. Our results show that we can detect a wide range of attacks-including attacks that have previously been undetectable by typical state estimation techniques-while causing no false-positive warning for nominal threshold values.

AB  - Application development for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is challenging because it involves dealing with the heterogeneity that exists both in Physical and Cyber worlds. Second, stakeholders involved in the application development have to address issues pertaining to different life-cycles ranging from design, implementation to deployment. Given these, a critical challenge is to enable an application development in CPSs with effectively and efficiently from various stakeholders.Several approaches to tackling this challenge have been proposed in the fields of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Pervasive Computing, regarded as precursors to the modern day of CPSs. However, existing approaches only cover limited subsets of the above mentioned challenges when applied to the CPSs. In view of this, the contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we have built upon our existing framework and evolved it into a framework for developing CPSs, with substantial additions and enhancements in high-level modeling languages and their integration into the framework. Second, we present a comparative evaluation results with existing approaches. This provides the CPS community for further benchmarking. The evaluation is carried out on real devices exhibiting heterogeneity. Our experimental analysis and results demonstrate that our approach drastically reduces development effort for CPSs compared to existing approaches.

TI  - Attack Detection for Medical Cyber-Physical Systems-A Systematic Literature Review
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Review
AB  - The threat situation due to cyber attacks in hospitals is emerging and patient life is at risk. One significant source of potential vulnerabilities is medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS). Detecting intrusions in this environment faces challenges different from other domains, mainly due to the heterogeneity of devices, the diversity of connectivity types, and the variety of terminology. To summarize existing results, we conducted a structured literature review (SLR) following the guidelines of Kitchenham et al. for SLRs in software engineering. We developed six research questions regarding detection approach, detection location, included features, adversarial focus, utilized datasets, and intrusion prevention. We identified that most researchers focused on an anomaly-based detection approach at the network layer. The primary focus was on the detection of malicious insiders. While several researchers used publicly available datasets for training and testing their algorithms, the lack of suitable datasets resulted in the development of testbeds consisting of various medical devices. Based on the results, we formulated five future research topics. First, the special conditions of hospital networks, the MCPS deployed within them, and the contrasts to other IT and OT environments should be examined. Thereupon, MCPS-specific datasets should be created that allow researchers to address the health domain's unique requirements and possibilities. At the same time, endeavors aimed at standardization in this area should be supported and expanded. Moreover, the use of medical context for attack detection should be further explored. Last but not least, efforts for MCPS-tailored intrusion prevention should be intensified. This way, the emerging threat landscape can be addressed, IT security in hospitals can be improved, and patient health can be protected.

TI  - PERFORMANCE COMPARISON OF 3 MODERN DBMS ARCHITECTURES
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The introduction of powerful workstations connected through local area networks (LAN's) inspired new DBMS architectures that offer high performance characteristics. In this paper, we examine three such software architecture configurations: Client-Server (CS), RAD-UNIFY(R) type of DBMS (RU), and Enhanced Client-Server (ECS). Their specific functional components and design rationales are discussed. We use three simulation models to provide a performance comparison under different job workloads. Our simulation results show that the RU almost always performs slightly better than the CS, especially under light workloads, and that ECS offers significant performance improvement over both CS and RU. Under reasonable update rates, the ECS over CS (or RU) performance ratio is almost proportional to the number of participating clients (for less than 32 clients). We also examine the impact of certain key parameters on the performance of the three architectures and finally show that ECS is more scalable that the other two.

TI  - Cloud-Assisted Context-Aware Vehicular Cyber-Physical System for PHEVs in Smart Grid
T2  - IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) can be one of the cost-effective options of modern intelligent transportation systems in smart grid (SG) which can balance the demand and supply by temporarily storing the electrical energy in their batteries. In this paper, we propose a new context-aware layered architecture for demand side management using vehicular cyber-physical system (VCPS) with cloud support. We have used the concept of Bayesian coalition game and learning automata for an intelligent context-aware data collection and processing using a new payoff function for the players in the coalition game. In the proposed scheme, vehicles are assumed as the players which sense the SG environment during their mobility and collect information from it. The players in the game perform actions such as alert generation, and information dissemination. For each action, players receive a feedback from the environment according to which they update their action probability vector. The performance of the proposed scheme shows that there is a reduction in energy shortage by 30%, and information processing delay of 10%-15%. In addition, there is an increase of 15% in energy sold back to the grid using the proposed scheme. The results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

TI  - Multi-paradigm modeling for cyber-physical systems: A systematic mapping review
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Review
AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are heterogeneous and require cross-domain expertise to model. The complexity of these systems leads to questions about prevalent modeling approaches, their ability to integrate heterogeneous models, and their relevance to the application domains and stakeholders. The methodology for Multi-Paradigm Modeling (MPM) of CPS is not yet fully established and standardized, and researchers apply existing methods for modeling of complex systems and introducing their own. No systematic review has been previously performed to create an overview of the field on the methods used for MPM of CPS. In this paper, we present a systematic mapping study that determines the models, formalisms, and development processes used over the last decade. Additionally, to determine the knowledge necessary for developing CPS, our review studied the background of actors involved in modeling and authors of surveyed studies. The results of the survey show a tendency to reuse multiple existing formalisms and their associated paradigms, in addition to a tendency towards applying transformations between models. These findings suggest that MPM is becoming a essential approach to model CPS, and highlight the importance of future integration of models, standardization of development process and education.

TI  - Application-independent Approach for the Dynamic Management of IT-Resources in Cyber-Physical Systems
T2  - PROCEEDINGS 2016 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY (ICIT)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICET)
CL  - Taipei, TAIWAN
AB  - This paper proposes an application-independent, SOA-based approach for the dynamic management of IT-resources in distributed cyber-physical systems. According to the networks' openness, the ad-hoc formation and the cross-domain character of future automation systems, design-time and run-time are blurring. Existing methods are limited to one type of resource and are highly specialized to one certain application. Solution-patterns are needed, which allow transferring the needed flexibilities easily to new applications. The contribution of this work is an application-independent approach for dynamic management of IT-resources in CPS, which forms an SOA-based, easy adaptable solution-pattern. Therefore, a resource-based view on CPS, based on the resource-stack model from cloud computing, is introduced as a layer of abstraction. A resource-manager decides which resource to scale and how. The concept is evaluated by an application example from the field of process engineering. Finally, a qualitative evaluation of the described method is performed.

AB  - Biological organisms show a remarkable flexibility in how they organize their behavior and adapt it to changed circumstances. In this paper, we apply some of the more interesting concepts from biological theory to cyber-physical systems, especially those in such remote or hazardous environments that we cannot expect our control of them to be adequate for success or even survival.We propose a software architecture based on our Wrappings infrastructure, and show how it manages all of the resources necessary for autonomous operation, how it uses interacting planning and decision processes to organize its activity (determining that it cannot do something is one important aspect of the decision and planning processes), and how it uses various analyses of detailed behavioral instrumentation to improve that behavior or determine that improvement is not possible.We describe several difficult questions that arise when implementing our system architecture, and discuss how they might be addressed.

AB  - Software development for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), e.g., autonomous vehicles, requires both functional and non-functional quality assurance to guarantee that the CPS operates safely and effectively. EAST-ADL is a domain specific architectural language dedicated to safety-critical automotive embedded system design. We have previously modified EAST-ADL to include energy constraints and transformed energy-aware real-time (ERT) behaviors modeled in EAST-ADL/Stateflow into UPPAAL models amenable to formal verification. Previous work is extended in this paper by including support for Simulink and an integration of Simulink/Stateflow (S/S) within the same tool-chain. S/S models are transformed, based on the extended ERT constraints with probability parameters, into verifiable UPPAAL-SMC models and integrate the translation with formal statistical analysis techniques: Probabilistic extension of EAST-ADL constraints is defined as a semantics denotation. A set of mapping rules is proposed to facilitate the guarantee of translation. Formal analysis on both functional-and non-functional properties is performed using Simulink Design Verifier and UPPAAL-SMC. Our approach is demonstrated on the autonomous traffic sign recognition vehicle case study.

AB  - MATLAB/Simulink is a de-facto standard tool in several safety-critical industries such as automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and industrial automation for system modeling and analysis, compiling models to code, and deploying code to embedded hardware. On one hand, testing cyber-physical system (CPS) development tools such as MathWorks' Simulink is important as a bug in the toolchain may propagate to the artifacts they produce. On the other hand, it is equally important to understand modeling practices and model evolution to support engineers and scientists as they are widely used in design, simulation, and verification of CPS models. Existing work in this area is limited by two main factors, i.e., (1) inefficiencies of state-of-the-art testing schemes in finding critical tool-chain bugs and (2) the lack of a reusable corpus of public Simulink models. In my thesis, I propose to (1) curate a large reusable corpus of Simulink models to help understand modeling practices and model evolution and (2) leverage such a corpus with deep-learning based language models to test the toolchain.

TI  - Testing self-healing cyber-physical systems under uncertainty with reinforcement learning: an empirical study
T2  - EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Self-healing is becoming an essential feature of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). CPSs with this feature are named Self-Healing CPSs (SH-CPSs). SH-CPSs detect and recover from errors caused by hardware or software faults at runtime and handle uncertainties arising from their interactions with environments. Therefore, it is critical to test if SH-CPSs can still behave as expected under uncertainties. By testing an SH-CPS in various conditions and learning from testing results, reinforcement learning algorithms can gradually optimize their testing policies and apply the policies to detect failures, i.e., cases that the SH-CPS fails to behave as expected. However, there is insufficient evidence to know which reinforcement learning algorithms perform the best in terms of testing SH-CPSs behaviors including their self-healing behaviors under uncertainties. To this end, we conducted an empirical study to evaluate the performance of 14 combinations of reinforcement learning algorithms, with two value function learning based methods for operation invocations and seven policy optimization based algorithms for introducing uncertainties. Experimental results reveal that the 14 combinations of the algorithms achieved similar coverage of system states and transitions, and the combination of Q-learning and Uncertainty Policy Optimization (UPO) detected the most failures among the 14 combinations. On average, the Q-Learning and UPO combination managed to discover two times more failures than the others. Meanwhile, the combination took 52% less time to find a failure. Regarding scalability, the time and space costs of the value function learning based methods grow, as the number of states and transitions of the system under test increases. In contrast, increasing the system's complexity has little impact on policy optimization based algorithms.

AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) combine software with the physical world. For this purpose, CPS must model physical behavior in software. However, a software-based model cannot always accurately reflect the physical world. Often the model is a simplification of complex physical processes, or it suffers from measurement errors, or the physical side is subject to modifications and parameter drift, or the model is simply subject to misconceptions. It is an open research challenge how we can verify that physics and software-based model fit together. However, to rely on CPS in real-world scenarios we must ensure that physics and model are aligned. We propose a model formalism based on hidden Markov models that considers uncertainty and unknown phenomena and is robust enough to allow the analysis of CPS when working with error-prone data. More specifically, given observation data and an instance of the proposed model for a CPS (both of which may be flawed) the proposed formalism allows us to quantify the suitability between physics and model. If, however, a given model instance is deemed correct, the formalism enables methods which identify and smooth corrupt observation data as well as compute the most likely sequence of events for a given set of observations. Additionally, the formalism enables the learning of a suitable model according to given observation data. The model formalism will be tested with a simulation and a case study of an overhead traveling cargo crane system.

T2  - IET CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS: THEORY & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing number of services and industries including nuclear, chemical, aerospace, and automotive sectors in cyber-physical systems (CPSs), systems are being severely overloaded. CPSs comprises mixed-critical tasks which are of either safety-critical (high) or non-safety critical (low). In traditional task scheduling, most of the existing scheduling algorithms provide poor performance for high-criticality tasks when the system experiences overload and do not show explicit separation among different criticality tasks to take advantage of using cloud resources. Here, we propose a framework to schedule the mixed-criticality tasks by analyzing their deadlines and execution times which leverage the performance of parallel processing through OpenMP. The proposed framework introduces a machine learning-based prediction for a task offloading in the cloud. Moreover, it illustrates to execute a selected number of low-criticality tasks in the cloud while the high-criticality tasks are run on the local processors during the system overload. As a result, the high-criticality tasks meet all their deadlines and the system achieves a significant improvement in the overall execution time and better throughput. In addition, the experimental results employing OpenMP show the effectiveness of using the partitioned scheduling over the global scheduling method upon multiprocessor systems to achieve the tasks isolation.

AB  - The Industry 4.0 vision anticipates that internet technologies will find their way into future factories replacing traditional components by dynamic and intelligent cyber-physical systems (CPS) that combine the physical objects with their digital representation. Reducing the gap between the real and digital world makes the factory environment more flexible, more adaptive, but also demand broader skill of human workers. Interdisciplinary competencies from engineering, information technology, and computer science are required in order to understand and manage the diverse interrelations between physical objects and their digital counterpart. This paper proposes a system architecture for a mixed-reality based learning environment, which combines physical objects and visualization of its digital content via Augmented Reality. It allows to make the dynamic interrelations between real and digital factory visible and tangible. The proposed learning environment is not meant to work as a stand-alone solution, but should enrich existing academic and advanced training curricula. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents a simulation model of the Time-Triggered Protocol (TTP/C) based embedded computer system as a tool for evaluation of system capability to tolerate a chosen category of faults. The model, being written in ANSI-C, is portable and machine-independent. Its structure is modular and flexible, so that the system to be studied and the experiment setting can easily be changed. The functionality of this model is demonstrated on a set of fault injection experiments aimed mainly to evaluate the correctness of the TTP/C specification. These experiments were done within the EU/IST FIT (Fault Injection for Time triggered architecture) project solution.

TI  - Customizing Avatars to Enable No-Code Telerehabilitation Movement Therapy
T2  - COMPUTER ANIMATION AND VIRTUAL WORLDS
M3  - Article
AB  - While numerous motion capture tools have emerged, scarcer are solutions tailored for code-free utilization environments. An intuitive no-code interface promises greater accessibility for diverse user groups. Guided by this premise, the myKLA2 toolkit incorporates integrated decoder, editor, and player components tailored for code-free motion development workflows. Leveraging cyber-physical system principles, the software enables users to customize digital avatars by selecting from a large repository of sharable 3D VRM models. Additionally, McCabe's cyclomatic complexity analysis facilitated iterative refactoring to optimize system capabilities and toolset performance. Advanced joint tracking and motion capture algorithms enable precise avatar animation mirroring user movements in real-time. A human-readable JSON format facilitates configurable behavior encoding and exchange. This research demonstrates the system's potential as a versatile no-code toolkit for rapid development and design across healthcare, education, and other domains. By automating core tasks like motion tracking configuration, sensor calibration, and basic quantitative assessments, this tool promises to streamline therapist workflows in telerehabilitation.

TI  - Experience from model and software reuse in aircraft simulator product line engineering
T2  - INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: "Reuse" and "Model Based Development" are two prominent trends for improving industrial development efficiency. Product lines are used to reduce the time to create product variants by reusing components. The model based approach provides the opportunity to enhance knowledge capture for a system in the early stages in order to be reused throughout its lifecycle. This paper describes how these two trends are combined to support development and support of a simulator product line for the SAAB 39 Gripen fighter aircraft.Objective: The work aims at improving the support (in terms of efficiency and quality) when creating simulation model configurations. Software based simulators are flexible so variants and versions of included models may easily be exchanged. The objective is to increase the reuse when combining models for usage in a range of development and training simulators.Method: The research has been conducted with an interactive approach using prototyping and demonstrations, and the evaluation is based on an iterative and a retrospective method.Results: A product line of simulator models for the SAAB 39 Gripen aircraft has been analyzed and defined in a Product Variant Master. A configurator system has been implemented for creation, integration, and customization of stringent simulator model configurations. The system is currently under incorporation in the standard development process at SAAB Aeronautics.Conclusion: The explicit and visual description of products and their variability through a configurator system enables better insights and a common understanding so that collaboration on possible product configurations improves and the potential of software reuse increases. The combination of application fields imposes constraints on how traditional tools and methods may be utilized. Solutions for Design Automation and Knowledge Based Engineering are available, but their application has limitations for Software Product Line engineering and the reuse of simulation models.

TI  - NEW CYBER PHYSICAL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF DRIVING BEHAVIOR WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF CONNECTED VEHICLES
T2  - COMPUTING AND INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we address the problem of managing driving behaviours within the context of Connected Vehicles (CVs). In contrast with the existing related solutions, we are proposing a Cyber Physical System (CPS) architecture that ultimately enables the continuous acquisition and processing of driving data and then the assessment and classification of driving performance according to a welldefined set of driving states. The transitions between these states are decided based on current and previous driving records. In addition to their use for the generation of the appropriate feedback to the driver, the driving states could be used to identify relevant data to be shared with the CVs in the vicinity. They could also be used to recommend personalized trainings to the driver based on his/her driving performance.

CL  - Houston, TX
AB  - Adoption of an NC and/or CNC machine tools for metal machining has been a norm in contemporary manufacturing industry. Most of the machining information comes from the digital data generated from the adopted CAD/CAM software system. This can be served as the basis in forming a traditional flexible machining system (FMS) and/or computer integrated manufacturing system (CIM) for the integration among highly digitalized hardware. However, traditional FMS might become isolated digital islands if the used hardware and software are not digitally linked appropriately. This might result in, for example, reworking, errors, and risks in manufacturing industry practices.This research focused on developing an IMS (intelligent manufacturing system) through the synergy of communication of machine tools, process management, and production knowhow to enable a cyber-physical system. The system architecture and the networking technique of the system are illustrated in this paper through a case study on a precision mold making system. The case study showed that about 40% of mold production time could be shortened. Furthermore, the learning curve of machinery operation could be eased, and the workload of an operator could also be reduced. This has then successfully demonstrated that networked production system with the integration of manufacturing information could be used to facilitate an IMS.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 11th IEEE International Symposium on Service-Oriented System Engineering (SOSE)
CL  - San Francisco, CA
AB  - Service-oriented architecture (SOA) for Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) can be implemented through the abstraction of sensing and actuation capabilities of devices as microservices and providing data processing and decision-making services at higher levels. However, specific to CPS, the critical requirement of adaptivity must be taken into account so that the architectures can autonomously handle the dynamic changes in the devices and their environment making them transparent to the applications. Towards this, we implement the well-known MAPE-K (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Act, using stored Knowledge) reference architecture from autonomic computing, with the core Plan function powered by AI planning techniques. The proof of concept prototype is built upon our earlier works: InteropAdapt, a middleware for interoperability of control actions between the application layer and the device layer, and HINC, an information model that harmonizes IoT resources spanning devices, network functions and cloud resources. We illustrate our ideas via realistic examples in the building automation domain.

AB  - Since the world is moving towards secure systems which makes security a primary concern and not an afterthought in software development. Secure software development involves security at each step of development lifecycle from requirements phase to testing. With surging focus on security requirements, we can see an increase in frameworks/methods/techniques proposed to deal with security requirements for variable applications. However, to summarise the literature findings till date and to propose further ways to handle security requirements a systematic and comprehensive review is needed. Our objective is to conduct a systematic mapping study for cyber-physical systems: (i) to explore and analyse security requirements engineering frameworks/ methods/techniques proposed till date, (ii) to investigate on their strengths and weaknesses, and (iii) to determine the security threats and requirements reported in literature. We conducted a systematic mapping study for which we defined our goals and determined research questions, defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, and designed the map systematically based on the research questions. The search yielded 337 articles after deploying the query on multiple databases and refining the search iteratively through a multistep process. The mapping study identified and categorised the existing security requirements engineering frameworks/methods/techniques focused on their implementation and evaluation mechanisms. Second, we identified and categorised the proposed to deal with security requirements for multiple domains, determined their strengths/weaknesses, and also security requirements and threats reports in the selected studies. The study provides an overall view of the state-of-the-art frameworks/methods/techniques proposed till date to deal with security requirements. The results of this study provide insights to researchers to focus more on developing frameworks to deal with security requirements for particular kinds of systems like cyber-physical systems. Also, it motivates future work to devise methods to cater domain specific security risks and requirements.

TI  - Deep Federated Learning Enhanced Secure POI Microservices for Cyber-Physical Systems
T2  - IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - An essential consideration in cyber-physical systems (CPS) is the ability to support secure communication services, such as points of interest (POI) microservices. Existing approaches to support secure POI microservices generally rely on anonymity and/or differential privacy technologies. There are, however, a number of known limitations with such approaches. Hence, this work presents a deep-federated-learning-based framework for securing POI microservices in CPS. In order to enhance data security, the system architecture is designed to isolate the cloud center from accessing user data on edge nodes, and an interactive training mechanism is introduced between the cloud center and edge nodes. Specifically, edge nodes pre-train reliable deep-learning-based models for users, and the cloud server coordinates parameter updating via federated learning. The connected and isolated structure between cloud center and edges facilitates deep federated learning. Finally, we implement and evaluate the performance of our proposed approach using two real-world POI-related datasets. The results show that our proposed approach achieves optimal scheduling performance and demonstrates its practical utility.

M3  - Article
AB  - The increased usage of smart devices and appliances opens new venues to build applications that integrate physical and virtual world into consumer-oriented context-sensitive cyber-physical systems (CPS). Since physical processes are dynamic, concurrent, event-driven, and powered by various sensors, controllers, and actuators, a combination of service-oriented architecture (SOA) and event-driven architecture (EDA) is the most promising software architecture for virtualization of heterogeneous components into interoperable application building blocks. In this paper, we propose a CPS design paradigm where devices, such as sensors, controllers, and actuators, are virtualized into environmental services. To support event-driven workflow coordination, we designed special-purpose coopetition services that provide fundamental EDA characteristics, such as decoupled interactions, many-to-many communication, publish/subscribe messaging, event triggering, and asynchronous operations. Based on these two groups of services, we present a design of event-driven service composition languages that target two distinct groups of developers. Using Python as an example, we present a transformation of arbitrary general-purpose programming language into an event-driven service composition language for developers familiar with parallel programming using operating system kernel mechanisms. On the other hand, we present the design and cognitive evaluation of an end-user language, whose 2D tabular workspace resembles the process of sketching an automation application on a sheet of paper.

TI  - Probabilistic Inference of Fault Condition of Cyber-Physical Systems Under Uncertainty
T2  - IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are paving new ground with increasing levels of automation and usage in applications with complex environments, posing greater challenges in terms of safety and reliability. The increasing complexity of CPS environments, tasks, and systems leads to more uncertainties. Unless properly managed, these uncertainties may lead to false detection of real fault condition of a system, which in turn may affect decision making and potentially cause fatal consequences. In order to implement safety-critical missions, such as autonomous driving, it is essential to develop a reliable monitoring and assessment service dealing with the complexity and uncertainty issues. In this article, we propose a fault detection function based on Bayesian inference, which combines empirical knowledge with information of the specific system. By considering uncertainties as possible causes for false detection, various uncertainties during the detection process are analyzed, and the ways to quantify and propagate them are explored. As a result, probabilistic inference is achieved for distinguishing system faults from uncertainties, which contributes to more reliable detection results regarding system faults under dynamically changing environments. A case study on an microelectro mechanical system (MEMS) accelerometer is conducted and the result shows that the fault detection function effectively distinguishes system faults and uncertainties arising from the environment.

TI  - DEVS MODEL CONSTRUCTION AS A REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PROBLEM

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 70th Annual Modeling and Simulation Conference (ANNSIM)
CL  - Soc Modeling & Simulat Int, San Diego, CA
AB  - Simulators are crucial components in many software-intensive systems, such as cyber-physical systems and digital twins. The inherent complexity of such systems renders the manual construction of simulators an error-prone and costly endeavor, and automation techniques are much sought after. However, current automation techniques are typically tailored to a particular system and cannot be easily transposed to other settings. In this paper, we propose an approach for the automated construction of simulators that can overcome this limitation, based on the inference of Discrete Event System Specifications (DEVS) models by reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning allows inferring knowledge on the construction process of the simulator, instead of inferring the simulator itself. This, in turn, fosters reuse across different systems. DEVS further improves the reusability of this knowledge, as the vast majority of simulation formalisms can be efficiently translated to DEVS. We demonstrate the performance and generalizability of our approach on an illustrative example implemented in Python and Tensorforce.

TI  - Distributed Digital Twins as Proxies-Unlocking Composability and Flexibility for Purpose-Oriented Digital Twins
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the realm of the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS), Digital Twins (DTs) have revolutionized the management of physical entities. However, existing implementations often face constraints due to hardware-centric approaches and limited flexibility. This article introduces a transformative paradigm that harnesses the potential of distributed digital twins as proxies, enabling software-centricity and unlocking composability and flexibility for purpose-oriented digital twin development and deployment. The proposed microservices-based architecture, rooted in service-oriented architecture (SOA) and microservices principles, emphasizes reusability, modularity, and scalability. Leveraging the Lean Digital Twin Methodology and packaged business capabilities expedites digital twin creation and deployment, facilitating dynamic responses to evolving industrial demands. This architecture segments the industrial realm into physical and virtual spaces, where core components are responsible for digital twin management, deployment, and secure interactions. By abstracting and virtualizing physical entities into individual digital twins, this approach lays the groundwork for purpose-oriented composite digital twin creation. Our key contributions involve a comprehensive exposition of the architecture, a practical proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation, and the application of the architecture in a use-case scenario. Additionally, we provide an analysis, including a quantitative evaluation of the proxy aspect and a qualitative comparison with traditional approaches. This assessment emphasizes key properties such as reusability, modularity, abstraction, discoverability, and security, transcending the limitations of contemporary industrial systems and enabling agile, adaptable digital proxies to meet modern industrial demands.

AB  - With the continuous expansion of applications field on the computer system simulation, the problems of system modeling faced has become more and more complex. At present, there are two main problems: First, modeling object is complex, with a variety of uncertainties and nonlinear characteristics difficult to describe accurately; Second, the requirements of the system modeling more and more higher, urgent to improve the capacity of description of the system model, flexibility, universality and intelligence of the modeling approach. Artificial neural network (ANN) is a new theory and technology for the rapid development of computer intelligent research in recent years. It is applied to computer system simulation modeling because it is used to solve the problem without the need to establish accurate physical model and mathematical model in advance. The multi-layer network can approximate any continuous function, and is equivalent to a differential equation (group) to describe the actual system. It is a kind of system modeling method with strong applicability. At the same time, the method has the ability to learn and acquire the knowledge from the environment (e.g. by learning input/output of the typical sample data input / output to the system, to obtain the hidden rules), so it has good adaptability to the system simulation problem.

AB  - In this work, we an envision Home Energy Management System (HEMS) as a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) architecture including three stages: Data Acquisition, Communication Network, and Data Analytics. In this CPS, monitoring, forecasting, comfort, occupation, and other strategies are conceived to feed a control plane representing the decision-making process. We survey the main technologies and techniques implemented in the recent years for each of the stages, reviewing and identifying the cutting-edge challenges that the research community are currently facing. For the Acquisition part, we define a metering device according to the IEC TS 63297:2021 Standard. We analyze the communication infrastructure as part of beyond 2030 communication era (5G and 6G), and discuss the Analytics stage as the cyber part of the CPS-based HEMS. To conclude, we present a case study in which, using real data collected in an experimental environment, we validate proposed architecture of HEMS in monitoring tasks. Results revealed an accuracy of 99.2% in appliance recognition compared with the state-of-the-art proposals.

TI  - Modeling and simulation framework for quality estimation of web applications through architecture evaluation
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The explosive growth of the cloud computing industry in recent years has paying attention to problems related to software services quality. Given that quality models serve as frameworks for quality evaluation, this paper proposes a modeling and simulation framework that measures properties derived from ISO/IEC 25010 quality model as main quality concerns of cloud computing applications. The simulation models are obtained by translating the architectural design to an equivalent functional description that, with aims to obtain the quality evaluation, explores all possible component states. Moreover, the framework automatically builds the simulation models using a set of predefined behaviors as components descriptors. Such models are combined with an experimental frame in a simulation scenario that helps to estimate quality employing the performance of the architectural design. Therefore the simulation process is hidden to software architects, providing an evaluation process able to be executed by any developer without knowledge of discrete-event simulation. Two general architectures are used as case study in order to show how works the modeling and simulation framework.

AB  - Mutation testing consists of generating test cases that detect faults injected into software (generating mutants) which its original test suite could not. By running such an augmented set of test cases, it may discover actual faults that may have gone unnoticed with the original test suite. It is thus a desired practice for embedded software running in safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS). Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art tool targeting C, a typical language for CPS software, relies on symbolic execution, whose limitations often prevent its application. MOTIF overcomes such limitations by leveraging grey-box fuzzing tools to generate unit test cases in C that detect injected faults in mutants. Indeed, fuzzing tools automatically generate inputs by exercising the compiled version of the software under test guided by coverage feedback, thus overcoming the limitations of symbolic execution. Our empirical assessment has shown that it detects more faults than symbolic execution (i.e., up to 47 percentage points), when the latter is applicable.

TI  - The slow and the furious? Performance antipattern detection in Cyber-Physical Systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) have gained traction in recent years. A major non-functional quality of CPS is performance since it affects both usability and security. This critical quality attribute depends on the specialized hardware, simulation engines, and environmental factors that characterize the system under analysis. While a large body of research exists on performance issues in general, studies focusing on performance -related issues for CPSs are scarce. The goal of this paper is to build a taxonomy of performance issues in CPSs. To this aim, we present two empirical studies aimed at categorizing common performance issues (Study I) and helping developers detect them (Study II). In the first study, we examined commit messages and code changes in the history of 14 GitHub-hosted open -source CPS projects to identify commits that report and fix selfadmitted performance issues. We manually analyzed 2699 commits, labeled them, and grouped the reported performance issues into antipatterns. We detected instances of three previously reported Software Performance Antipatterns (SPAs) for CPSs. Importantly, we also identified new SPAs for CPSs not described earlier in the literature. Furthermore, most performance issues identified in this study fall into two new antipattern categories: Hard Coded Fine Tuning (399 of 646) and Magical Waiting Number (150 of 646). In the second study, we introduce static analysis techniques for automatically detecting these two new antipatterns; we implemented them in a tool called AP -Spotter. We analyzed 9 open -source CPS projects not utilized to build the SPAs taxonomy to benchmark AP -Spotter. Our results show that AP -Spotter achieves 62.04% precision in detecting the antipatterns.

TI  - Developing a Digital Twin at Building and City Levels: Case Study of West Cambridge Campus
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - A digital twin (DT) refers to a digital replica of physical assets, processes, and systems. DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to create living digital simulation models that are able to learn and update from multiple sources as well as represent and predict the current and future conditions of physical counterparts. However, current activities related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets from an architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase, which is the longest time span in the asset life cycle. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT would be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of buildings and cities. According to current research about multitier architectures, this paper presents a system architecture for DTs that is specifically designed at both the building and city levels. Based on this architecture, a DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge in the UK was developed that integrates heterogeneous data sources, supports effective data querying and analysis, supports decision-making processes in O&M management, and further bridges the gap between human relationships with buildings/cities. This paper aims at going through the whole process of developing DTs in building and city levels from the technical perspective and sharing lessons learned and challenges involved in developing DTs in real practices. Through developing this DT demonstrator, the results provide a clear roadmap and present particular DT research efforts for asset management practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to promote the implementation and development of DT at the building and city levels.

TI  - The HORSE framework: A reference architecture for cyber-physical systems in hybrid smart manufacturing
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Industry 4.0 era, manufacturers strive to remain competitive by using advanced technologies such as collaborative robots, automated guided vehicles, augmented reality support and smart devices. However, only if these technological advancements are integrated into their system context in a seamless way, they can deliver their full potential to a manufacturing organization. This integration requires a system architecture as a blueprint for positioning and interconnection of the technologies. For this purpose, the HORSE framework, resulting from the HORSE EU H2020 project, has been developed to act as a reference architecture of a cyber-physical system to integrate various Industry 4.0 technologies and support hybrid manufacturing processes, i.e., processes in which human and robotic workers collaborate. The architecture has been created using design science research, based on well-known software engineering frameworks, established manufacturing domain standards and practical industry requirements. The value of a reference architecture is mainly established by application in practice. For this purpose, this paper presents the application and evaluation of the HORSE framework in 10 manufacturing plants across Europe, each with its own characteristics. Through the physical deployment and demonstration, the framework proved its goal to be basis for the well-structured design of an operational smart manufacturing cyber-physical system that provides horizontal, cross-functional management of manufacturing processes and vertical control of heterogeneous technologies in work cells. We report on valuable insights on the difficulties to realize such systems in specific situations. The experiences form the basis for improved adoption, further improvement and extension of the framework. In sum, this paper shows how a reference architecture framework supports the structured application of Industry 4.0 technologies in manufacturing environments that so far have relied on more traditional digital technology.

CP  - 34th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE)

AB  - From the point of view of a software engineer, having safe and optimal controllers for real life systems like cyber physical systems is a crucial requirement before deployment. Given the mathematical model of these systems along with their specifications, model checkers can be used to synthesize controllers for them.The given work proposes novel approaches for making controller analysis easier by using machine learning to represent the controllers synthesized by model checkers in a succinct manner, while also incorporating the domain knowledge of the system. It also proposes the implementation of a visualization tool which will be integrated into existing model checkers. A lucid controller representation along with a tool to visualize it will help the software engineer debug and monitor the system much more efficiently.

TI  - Semantics-Based Noninterference Assessment in Cyber-Physical Systems
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Event-aware information flow security in cyber- physical systems (CPSs) emphasizes the correlation among events. Event-aware noninterference is a security property capable to describe such a correlation. In light of the event-aware noninterference assessment problem, system modeling is a common means, and many studies have been done on such a problem by using formal modeling tools, i.e., Petri nets (PNs), at present. However, classical PNs suffer from the lack of modeling for patterns with semantic sharing of events, which can be modeled by labeled PNs (LPNs). In this article, we present the concept of semantics-based noninterference for the CPSs modeled by LPNs and focus on the assessment problem of semantics-based noninterference properties represented by semantics-based strong nondeterministic noninterference (SNNI) and extended bisimulation SNNI (EBSNNI). To this end, we first give the formal definitions of semantics-based SNNI and EBSNNI. Then, we analyze the assessment mechanisms of them according to the characteristics of semantic sharing of events in LPNs. On this basis, we provide the semantics-based noninterference assessment method involving the coarse and fine assessments to reveal the event-aware security of CPSs. Finally, a case study is provided to explain the significance of our research and the effectiveness of our method.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 14th Annual Conference System of Systems Engineering (SoSE)
CL  - Anchorage, AK
AB  - As engineered systems increase their complexities, a new engineering nature of Systems of System (SoS) vitality is proposed aiming for a development trend from systems to self-adaption and self-recovery Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) in its adaptability to dynamic environmental changes. In terms of engineered system formalisms, an inorganic engineered system is transformed into a SoS composition with the characteristics of an organic lifeform, becoming a self-adaptive agent. Regarding to a way for constructing an engineering SoS, a traditional engineered system process model emerges in a new challenge with the addition of a virtual system in cyber space. In this paper, by analogy with the organic characteristics of living systems in nature, SoS vitality theory is proposed, which includes a technical framework and maturity level model for measuring the organic characteristics of engineering SoS for current technological development. This provides a conceptual reference for future directions in the development of engineered systems.

TI  - Model-Based Control Design of an EHA Position Control Based on Multicriteria Optimization
T2  - MACHINES
M3  - Article
AB  - For the control of dynamic systems such as an Electro-Hydraulic Actuator (EHA), there is a need to optimize the control based on simulations, since a prototype or a physical system is usually not available during system design. In consequence, no system identification can be performed. Therefore, it is unclear how well a simulation model of an EHA can be used for multicriteria optimization of the position control due to the uncertain model quality. To evaluate the suitability for control optimization, the EHA is modeled and parameterized as a grey-box model using existing parameters independent of test bench experiments. A method for multi-objective optimization of a controller is used to optimize the position control of the EHA. Finally, the step responses are compared with the test bench. The evaluation of the step responses for different loads and control parameters shows similar behavior between the simulation model and the physical system on the test bench, although the essential phenomena could not be reproduced. This means that the model quality achieved by modeling is suitable as an indication for the optimization of the control by simulation without a physical system.

T2  - IET CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS: THEORY & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyber-physical systems (CPS) integrate control, sensing, and processing into interconnected physical components to support applications within transportation, energy, healthcare, environment, and various other areas. Secure and reliable wireless communication between devices is necessary to enable the widespread adoption of these emerging technologies. Cyber-physical systems devices must be protected against active threats, such as Radio Frequency (RF) Jammers, which intentionally disrupt communication links. Jamming detection and mitigation techniques must be evaluated extensively to validate algorithms prior to full implementation. Challenges related to obtaining zoning permits, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) pilot certification for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licencing lead to evaluation limited to simulation-based or simplistic, non-representative hardware experimentation. A site-specific ray-tracing emulation framework is presented to provide a realistic evaluation of communication devices under RF jamming attacks in complex scenarios involving mobility, vehicular, and UAV systems. System architecture and capabilities are provided for the devices under test, real-world jamming adversaries, channel modelling, and channel emulation. Case studies are provided to demonstrate the use of the framework for different applications and jamming threats. The experimental results illustrate the benefit of the ray-tracing emulation system for conducting complex wireless communication studies under the presence of RF jamming.

CP  - 3rd International Symposium on Leveraging Applications of Formal Methods, Verification and Validation
CL  - Porto Sani, GREECE
AB  - Due to the time-to-market pressure, it is highly desirable to design hardware and software of embedded systems in parallel. However, hardware and software are developed mostly using very different methods, so that performance evaluation and validation of the whole system is riot all easy task. In this paper, we propose a simulation approach to bridge tire gap between model-driven software development and simulation based hardware design, by merging hardware and software models into a SystemC based simulation environment. An automated procedure has been established to generate software simulation models from formal models, while the hardware design is originally modeled in SystemC. As the simulation models are annotated with timing information, performance issues are tackled in the same pass as system functionality, rather than in a dedicated approach.For designing real-time systems, although performance evaluation based on simulation cannot provide guarantees of safety, it can provide realistic performance values to validate whether the performance requirements are really satisfied or riot and show how pessimistic the static analysis is. Further, the simulative approach is also able to provide the developers air insight into the system architecture to help find bottlenecks of the system. We use the simulative approach as a, complement of static analysis and combine them in an integral development cycle.

TI  - Joint pricing and openness decisions in software markets with reinforcing loops
T2  - SYSTEM DYNAMICS REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - In software markets, pricing and openness interact to determine profitability through the direct effect of openness on feasible prices and costs, and their impact on different reinforcing feedback loops such as network effects. We develop a simulation model of the inner workings of a software firm, product life cycle and market aggregation, and analyze their interactions in a competitive market. The reinforcing loops increase the value of early market lead and put pressure on the competing firms to seek such advantage. The competitive equilibrium under strong reinforcing loops calls for highly open software products with early discounts that significantly compromise the profitability of the players. Proprietary platforms and higher prices are favored when those mechanisms are weak. We discuss the implications of this analysis for the dynamics of different competitive markets as well as the contributions to the system dynamics literature in analyzing Nash equilibrium of differential games.

M3  - Article
AB  - In the early stages of a system of systems (SoS) conception, several constituent systems could be available that provide similar functionalities. An SoS design methodology should provide adequate means to model variability in order to support the opportunistic selection of the most desirable SoS configuration. We propose the VANTESS approach that (i) supports SoS modeling taking into account the variation points implied by the considered constituent systems; (ii) includes a heuristics to weight benefits and costs of potential architectural choices (called as SoS variants) for the selection of the constituent systems; and finally (iii) also helps test planning for the selected SoS variant by deriving a simulation model on which test objectives and scenarios can be devised. We illustrate an application example of VANTESS to the "educational" SoS and discuss its pros and cons within a focus group.

TI  - Automated System for Evaluating Alternatives for Developing Innovative IT Projects
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Software engineering occupies a prominent place in the theory and practice of simulation modeling, which necessitates scientific research in the field of methodological principles for forming software product quality. The problem of determining the optimal option for software development is one of the key ones in the field of information technology because it determines the quality of the final product and the efficiency of project management. The article considers the concept of developing an automated system, the basis of which is the software for assessing alternatives in the process of creating innovative IT projects. The main goal of the study is to model alternatives and select the optimal option for the process of creating an IT project using modern methodological approaches. For this purpose, the methods of ontological analysis, expert evaluation, multi-criteria optimization, pairwise comparisons and multi-factor selection of alternatives are applied. In the course of the research, a subset of Pareto factors is singled out and alternative development options are formed based on the method of linear convolution of criteria. The proposed methodology allows for assessing the importance of key factors and selecting the optimal option for the software development process. As a result, the developed approach contributes to strategic planning and increases the transparency of the decision-making process. The key result of the research is the created software product that allows one to automate the procedure for selecting the optimal solution for the IT project development process, providing reliable support for simulation modeling and increasing the efficiency of project management. The proposed methodology creates a new paradigm for making informed decisions regarding systems for creating complex software complexes.

TI  - Multiple Objective Functions for Falsification of Cyber-Physical Systems
T2  - IFAC PAPERSONLINE
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 15th IFAC Workshop on Discrete Event Systems (WODES)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Cyber-physical systems are typically safety-critical, thus it is crucial to guarantee that they conform to given specifications, that are the properties that the system must fulfill. Optimization-based falsification is a model-based testing method to find counterexamples of the specifications. The main idea is to measure how far away a specification is from being broken, and to use an optimization procedure to guide the testing towards falsification. The efficiency of the falsification is affected by the objective function used to evaluate the test results; different objective functions are differently efficient for different types of problems. However, the efficiency of various objective functions is not easily determined beforehand. This paper evaluates the efficiency of using multiple objective functions in the falsification process. The hypothesis is that this will, in general, be more efficient, meaning that it falsifies a system in fewer iterations, than just applying a single objective function to a specific problem. Two objective functions are evaluated, Max, Additive, on a set of benchmark problems. The evaluation shows that using multiple objective functions can reduce the number of iterations necessary to falsify a property. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The integration of connected and autonomous technologies in safety-critical and cyber-physical systems offers great potential in the vital application domains of transportation, manufacturing and aerospace. These technological advancements are necessary to meet the increasing demand for intelligent services, as they open doors to new business models by analysing and sharing the generated data. However, where this sharing of mix-critical data and broader connectivity brings opportunities, it simultaneously presents serious cybersecurity and safety risks due to the cyber-physical nature of these systems. Hence, delivering these intelligent services securely, safely, and reliably to its consumers is a complex engineering and design problem. One of the ways to approach this engineering problem is to consider both system functional and non-functional properties (safety, security, reliability) and systematically integrate them across system design and operational life cycle. The XANDAR project investigates this approach and aims to develop holistic software design methods and architectures for safety-critical and cyber-physical systems that guarantee functional and non-functional properties "by-construction". This paper focuses on the non-functional aspects of the project and discusses the preliminary work. by presenting the core cybersecurity principles and uses them as a baseline to propose a holistic cybersecurity engineering process. The tasks of the proposed cybersecurity engineering process are also map onto relevant clauses of ISO 21434. In future, proposed work will be integrated into the XANDAR software toolchain and validated for an avionics situation perception pilot assistance and automotive autonomous driving use cases.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 19th International ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE)
CL  - Venice, ITALY
AB  - The component-based software architecture of a cyber-physical system (CPS) is often subject to structural reconfigurations in response to changing environmental conditions. When introducing reconfigurations to CPS, it is mandatory to ensure that the execution of a reconfiguration does not compromise the safety of the system, e.g., by causing a violation of hard real-time constraints. Existing approaches for ensuring safe reconfiguration do not consider such hard real-time constraints or the interaction of a CPS with its physical environment. Thus, they can not detect all relevant unsafe situations. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that is based on a design-time specification of conditions for unsafe states combined with a runtime evaluation of these conditions. This enables to detect all relevant unsafe states with respect to a requested reconfiguration at runtime. We illustrate our approach based on a smart railway system.

TI  - A Comprehensive Technological Survey on the Dependable Self-Management CPS: From Self-Adaptive Architecture to Self-Management Strategies
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) has been a popular research area in the last decade. The dependability of CPS is still a critical issue, and few surveys have been published in this domain. CPS is a dynamic complex system, which involves various multidisciplinary technologies. To avoid human errors and to simplify management, self-management CPS (SCPS) is a wise choice. To achieve dependable self-management, systematic solutions are necessary to verify the design and to guarantee the safety of self-adaptation decisions, as well as to maintain the health of SCPS. This survey first recalls the concepts of dependability, and proposes a generic environment-in-loop processing flow of self-management CPS, and then analyzes the error sources and challenges of self-management through the formal feedback flow. Focusing on reducing the complexity, we first survey the self-adaptive architecture approaches and applied dependability means, then we introduce a hybrid multi-role self-adaptive architecture, and discuss the supporting technologies for dependable self-management at the architecture level. Focus on dependable environment-centered adaptation, we investigate the verification and validation (V&V) methods for making safe self-adaptation decision and the solutions for processing decision dependably. For system-centered adaptation, the comprehensive self-healing methods are summarized. Finally, we analyze the missing pieces of the technology puzzle and the future directions. In this survey, the technical trends for dependable CPS design and maintenance are discussed, an all-in-one solution is proposed to integrate these technologies and build a dependable organic SCPS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey on dependable SCPS building and evaluation.

TI  - Towards an integrated weed management decision support system: A simulation model for weed-crop competition and control
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - A mathematical simulation model for the multi-annual assessment of Integrated Weed Management strategies is presented. The model allows the simulation of the competitive interaction between annual weeds and crops. For weed development, the following processes are represented: (i) demographic dynamics on a daily basis considering the numeric composition of the different phenological states, (ii) infra and inter specific competition, (iii) seed production and (v) the effect of different control methods. For the crop development, the computed variables are: (i) Leaf Area Index, (ii) competitive effect over the weed, (iii) the expected yield as a function of weed competition. The model was developed in close collaboration with agricultural technicians and extensionists aiming to target a decision-making related audience. Results are provided for a wild oat (Avena fatua) - winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) / malting barley (Hordeum distichum) rotation system, typical of the Semiarid Pampean Region of Argentina. Multi-annual scenarios were generated to evaluate the effect of different management strategies against common herbicide-based practices in susceptible and resistant weed populations. Parts of the model were validated with independent experimental data. Finally, future improvements of the model and some guidelines towards the development of a long-term Decision Support System for weed management are provided.

AB  - SystemJ is a programming language developed for implementing safety critical cyber-physical systems, including industrial automation systems. However, the current tools do not support an efficient mechanism to verify SystemJ programs formally. This paper presents a semantics-preserving translation of the synchronous subset of SystemJ to Coloured Petri Net (CPN), which in turn enables leveraging the plethora of analysis and verification tools for CPN to verify SystemJ programs. The translation and verification approach is illustrated on a pedagogical industrial automation example of a SystemJ program.

AB  - Critical cyber-physical systems have an increasingly significant role in the world, and ensuring their safety is a high priority objective. State of the art approaches and engineering tools can support the development process from very early stages, with high-level system modeling, analysis capabilities, and exploration of alternatives. However, these approaches are limited when it comes evaluation of complex extra-functional characteristics over designs with uncertainties, typical to early system designs. In my thesis project, I intend to introduce probabilistic graph queries for high level, scalable probabilistic analysis, for analysing system models with design uncertainty and applicable in design space exploration. The approach will be evaluated on external case studies, focusing on key performance metrics related to applicability in the target context, such as runtime, precision and formal guarantees.

TI  - Backdoor Attacks on Safe Reinforcement Learning-Enabled Cyber-Physical Systems
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Safe reinforcement learning (RL) aims to derive a control policy that navigates a safety-critical system while avoiding unsafe explorations and adhering to safety constraints. While safe RL has been extensively studied, its vulnerabilities during the policy training have barely been explored in an adversarial setting. This article bridges this gap and investigates the training time vulnerability of formal language-guided safe RL. Such vulnerability allows a malicious adversary to inject backdoor behavior into the learned control policy. First, we formally define backdoor attacks for safe RL and divide them into active and passive ones depending on whether to manipulate the observation. Second, we propose two novel algorithms to synthesize the two kinds of attacks, respectively. Both algorithms generate backdoor behaviors that may go unnoticed after deployment but can be triggered when specific states are reached, leading to safety violations. Finally, we conduct both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to show the effectiveness and stealthiness of our methods.

AB  - The functionalities, actuations and effects that are produced by an application of a cyber physical system (CPS) are usually consumed by users while they perform their daily activities. Therefore, it is critical to ensure that they do not interfere with human activities and do not harm the people who are involved in the CPS. In this paper, we propose a framework to test and verify the reliability and safety of CPS applications in the perspectives of CPS environments and users. The framework provides an environment-aware testing method by which the efficiency of testing CPS applications can be improved by prioritizing CPS environments, and by applying machine learning techniques. The framework also includes a metric and an algorithm by which we can test and choose the most effective services that can deliver effects from their associated physical devices to users. In addition, the framework provides a computational model to test whether a CPS application may cause a cognitive depletion or contention problems for users.

AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) provide enormous potential for innovation. Examples are modern road vehicles (assisted and autonomous driving), CPS road networks (car2x), power plants, smart grids and healthcare devices. However, due to the dynamic interconnection and the largely unpredictable number of possible system configurations the dependable cooperation of CPS can not be fully assured at design time. The malfunction of a CPS could threaten human life, cause environmental damage and major financial loss. In order to address these challenges, this paper presents an early excerpt of an ongoing holistic approach and toolchain architecture that supports the design, development, implementation, operation and maintenance of dependable CPS. The proposed approach uses the dependability information accumulated during the system specification process as an input configuration for self-adaptive systems. These self-adaptive systems then test and assure the dependability properties of the CPS throughout the whole system life cycle.

AB  - Processing in memory (PIM) has increasingly attracted wide interests from academy and industry with the emergence of novel memory technologies and big-data applications. As a consequence, recent work has proposed different types of PIM architectures for various fields. However, most of their evaluations rely on dedicated simulation models, which make it hard to compare different architectures. Analytical models of PIM architectures, as a solution, have not been fully discussed in literature.To help architects and programmers easily evaluate overheads of various PIM architectures, this paper presents V-PIM, a generic and flexible analytical model. By characterizing an architecture with only several parameters, the model is simple but effective. To validate the model, we compare the results of V-PIM with simulation results against three novel PIM architectures and four tasks from data-intensive to computational-intensive. The average error of V-PIM is 15.2% or 7.1% for time or energy overheads according to our evaluation.

AB  - In view of the characteristics of the oil drilling process and the existing problems of traditional simulation system, a new distributed drilling simulation model was established based on Multi-Agent system (MAS) technology. By means of autonomous, cooperative and reactive characteristic of Agent, the drilling laws and phenomenon can be reflected promptly and accurately under any circumstances. The MAS modeling for oil drilling simulation, the structure and knowledge representation of each Agent and the communication among Agents are described in detail. Finally, an Agent-based normal drilling well control simulation training example was given.

AB  - Applying Model-Driven Engineering can improve development efficiency. But gaining such benefits for legacy software requires models, and creating them manually is both laborious and error prone. Active automata learning has the potential to make it cost-effective, but practitioners face practical challenges applying it to software components of industrial cyber-physical systems. To overcome these challenges, we present a framework to learn the behavior of component-based software with a client/server architecture, focusing on interfacing isolated component code with an active learning tool. An essential part of the framework is an interfacing protocol that provides a structured way of handling the (a)synchronous communications between the component and learning tool. Our main contribution is the systematic derivation of such interfacing protocols for component-based software, which we demonstrate on the software architecture of ASML, a leading company in developing lithography machines. Through several practical case studies we show that our semi-automatic approach enables setting up a learning environment to learn component behaviors within hours. The protocol's responsibilities and the way it handles different communication types apply to component-based software in general. Our framework could thus be adapted for companies with similar software architectures.

TI  - Security Analysis in Smart Agriculture: Insights from a Cyber-Physical System Application
T2  - CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
M3  - Article
AB  - Smart agriculture modifies traditional farming practices, and offers innovative approaches to boost production and sustainability by leveraging contemporary technologies. In today's world where technology is everything, these technologies are utilized to streamline regular tasks and procedures in agriculture, one of the largest and most significant industries in every nation. This research paper stands out from existing literature on smart agriculture security by providing a comprehensive analysis and examination of security issues within smart agriculture systems. Divided into three main sections-security analysis, system architecture and design and risk assessment of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) applications-the study delves into various elements crucial for smart farming, such as data sources, infrastructure components, communication protocols, and the roles of different stakeholders such as farmers, agricultural scientists and researchers, technology providers, government agencies, consumers and many others. In contrast to earlier research, this work analyzes the resilience of smart agriculture systems using approaches such as threat modeling, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments. Important discoveries highlight the concerns connected to unsecured communication protocols, possible threats from malevolent actors, and vulnerabilities in IoT devices. Furthermore, the study suggests enhancements for CPS applications, such as strong access controls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption protocols. In addition, risk assessment techniques are applied to prioritize mitigation tactics and detect potential hazards, addressing issues like data breaches, system outages, and automated farming process sabotage. The research sets itself apart even more by presenting a prototype CPS application that makes use of a digital temperature sensor. This application was first created using a Tinkercad simulator and then using actual hardware with Arduino boards. The CPS application's defenses against potential threats and vulnerabilities are strengthened by this integrated approach, which distinguishes this research for its depth and usefulness in the field of smart agriculture security.

M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this research is to provide a unified modelling-based method to help with the evaluation of organization design and change decisions. Relevant literature regarding model-driven organization design and change is described. This helps identify the requirements for a new modelling methodology. Such a methodology is developed and described. The three phases of the developed method include the following. First, the use of CIMOSA-based multi-perspective enterprise modelling to understand and capture the most enduring characteristics of process-oriented organizations and externalize various types of requirement knowledge about any target organization. Second, the use of causal loop diagrams to identify dynamic causal impacts and effects related to the issues and constraints on the organization under study. Third, the use of simulation modelling to quantify the effects of each issue in terms of organizational performance. The design and case study application of a unified modelling method based on CIMOSA (computer integrated manufacturing open systems architecture) enterprise modelling, causal loop diagrams, and simulation modelling, is explored to illustrate its potential to support systematic organization design and change. Further application of the proposed methodology in various company and industry sectors, especially in manufacturing sectors, would be helpful to illustrate complementary uses and relative benefits and drawbacks of the methodology in different types of organization. The proposed unified modelling-based method provides a systematic way of enabling key aspects of organization design and change. The case company, its relevant data, and developed models help to explore and validate the proposed method. The application of CIMOSA-based unified modelling method and integrated application of these three modelling techniques within a single solution space constitutes an advance on previous best practice. Also, the purpose and application domain of the proposed method offers an addition to knowledge.

AB  - A new robotics kit for education and research on cyber-physical systems is proposed. Mechanical design, electrical design, and software development methods are discussed. The result of the design effort is the CPSKit, a 3D-printable Arduino-based mobile robot kit with various capabilities. The CPSKit is meant to be low-cost, 3D-printable, and use off-the-shelf electronics so the users can modify and build customized robots depending on their budget. The kit can be used at K-12 or university levels, and the 3D-printable design makes it accessible for students to manufacture in the classroom using low-cost 3D printers. Moreover, the kit does not sacrifice key capabilities of a mobile robot, namely odometry and wireless communication. These capabilities which are necessary for a high-level autonomous mobile robot are often left out of existing educational robotics kits. Several applications and examples are demonstrated to show the capabilities of the CPSKit.

TI  - Heart-Lung Interactions During Mechanical Ventilation: Analysis via a Cardiopulmonary Simulation Model
T2  - IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Heart-lung interaction mechanisms are generally not well understood. Mechanical ventilation, for example, accentuates such interactions and could compromise cardiac activity. Thereby, assessment of ventilation-induced changes in cardiac function is considered an unmet clinical need. We believe that mathematical models of the human cardiopulmonary system can provide invaluable insights into such cardiorespiratory interactions. In this article, we aim to use a mathematical model to explain heart-lung interaction phenomena and provide physiologic hypotheses to certain contradictory experimental observations during mechanical ventilation. To accomplish this task, we highlight three model components that play a crucial role in heart-lung interactions: 1) pericardial membrane, 2) interventricular septum, and 3) pulmonary circulation that enables pulmonary capillary compression due to lung inflation. Evaluation of the model's response under simulated ventilation scenarios shows good agreement with experimental data from the literature. A sensitivity analysis is also presented to evaluate the relative impact of the model's highlighted components on the cyclic ventilation-induced changes in cardiac function.

AB  - In safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS), a service failure may result in severe financial loss or damage in human life. Smart CPSs have complex interaction with their environment which is rarely known in advance, and they heavily depend on intelligent data processing carried out over a heterogeneous computation platform and provide autonomous behavior. This complexity makes design time verification infeasible in practice, and many CPSs need advanced runtime monitoring techniques to ensure safe operation. While graph queries are a powerful technique used in many industrial design tools of CPSs, in this paper, we propose to use them to specify safety properties for runtime monitors on a high-level of abstraction. Distributed runtime monitoring is carried out by evaluating graph queries over a distributed runtime model of the system which incorporates domain concepts and platform information. We provide a semantic treatment of distributed graph queries using 3-valued logic. Our approach is illustrated and an initial evaluation is carried out using the MoDeS3 educational demonstrator of CPSs.

AB  - Open-source software (OSS) is a critical element in the design and operation of complex cyber-physical systems. Contributions to OSS projects are typically the result of voluntary work and time allocation by researchers, software developers, hackers, and even opportunistic programmers. These communities often operate on a "trust" basis, and although they strive to evaluate the technical correctness and merits of contributed code, the processes they use are usually loosely supervised. Social rules, trust, reputation, and even arcane processes often govern these communities. While these components have undoubtedly contributed to the growth and expansion of OSS, they could also lead to opportunities for subversion [3], hindering the reliability of an OSS project. This, in turn, could not only compromise the integrity of cyber-physical systems depending on OSS but also affect their performance.

AB  - Machine ( Statistical) learning methods are used for predicting the delivery times of the packages transmitted through the data network ( DN). The statistical model of the DN is proposed; this model allows predicting the delivery times depending on a state of the DN ( network load) and the statistical dependences between the delivery times of different transmitted packages. For constructing this model, various statistical methods ( forecasting, dimensionality reduction) are applied to the data which are the results of computational experiments performed with detailed simulation model of the DN. The constructed model simulates the processes of package transmission over the DN. Motivation for a construction of such model is a need to create Monte Carlo network simulators to imitate the delivery times of transmitted packages; such simulators can be used in modeling of Information and Control Systems whose objects communicate with each other through the DN.

AB  - The coupling of safety-relevant embedded- and cyber-space components to build Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) extends the functionality and quality in many business domains, while also creating new ones. Prime examples like Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 enable new technologies and extend the service capabilities of physical entities by building a universe of connected devices. In addition to higher complexity, the coupling of these heterogeneous systems results in many new challenges, which should be addressed by engineers and administrators. Here, security represents a major challenge, which may be well addressed in cyber-space engineering, but less in embedded system or CPS design. Although model-based engineering provides significant benefits for system architects, like reducing complexity and automated analysis, as well as being considered as standard methodology in embedded systems design, the aspect of security may not have had a major role in traditional engineering concepts. Especially the characteristics of CPS, as well as the coupling of safety-relevant (physical) components with high-scalable entities of the cyber-space domain have an enormous impact on the overall level of security, based on the introduced side effects and uncertainties. Therefore, we aim to define a model-based security-engineering framework, which is tailored to the needs of CPS engineers. Hereby, we focus on the actual modeling process, the evaluation of security, as well as quantitatively expressing security of a deployed CPS. Overall and in contrast to other approaches, we shift the engineering concepts on a semantic level, which allows to address the proposed challenges in CPS in the most efficient way.

TI  - Hardware/software avionic system performance (HASP): a design tool for a virtual prototyping system
T2  - AIRCRAFT ENGINEERING AND AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The complexity of evolving avionic systems and standards demands the need for cost-effective risk reduction to facilitate the smooth transition into new technologies. Simulation modelling and analysis provides a flexible means of achieving this aim. This paper describes the development of an avionic modelling environment that can be applied to the assessment of avionic architectures and standards. New avionic architecture concepts can be developed and investigated within the modelling framework. Evolving avionic standards can also be evaluated. Within the environment three modelling domains have been defined: behavioural, performance and visualisation. Behavioural models primarily constitute the software components of a system, the performance models analyse the hardware concepts, and visualisation models provide a means of understanding the system's operation. Collectively these domains form the hardware/software avionic system performance (HASP) simulation and modelling facility. The integration of the three modelling domains forms a design tool for a virtual prototyping system and this paper discusses how HASP can be integrated with a broad range of tools for the entire design process.

AB  - Modeling is a fundamental, analytical tool for engineering design. Programming is the synthesis (i.e. construction) of 'machines' that do something useful. Advances made during the past three decades showed how these activities are intertwined in systems development and cannot be separated. Arguably, the future of engineered systems shall encompass both, especially considering the design of cyber-physical systems where the computational is in continuous interaction with the physical. State-of-the-art industrial practice appears to focus on 'model-based programming' - programming with higher-level abstractions. In this paper we outline a broader picture for integrating modeling and programming, and what it means for engineering processes and engineering education.

AB  - In this paper we examine two case studies in which we learn finite state machines from models of CPS using automata learning. We explore how well automata learning is suited as an approach for learning CPS. What challenges and problems exist when trying to learn a model of a CPS using automata learning. Automata learning can reliably learn finite state machines of systems like embedded systems or software systems. CPS pose different challenges, like continuous components, for which different levels of abstractions and considerations have to be used, so the resulting finite state machines are useful representations of the systems. Through the small, yet insightful case studies we show examples of how automata learning can be applied to CPS and what information the resulting automata can represent.

AB  - A Collaborative Artificial Intelligence System (CAIS) is a cyber-physical system that learns actions in collaboration with humans in a shared environment to achieve a common goal. In particular, a CAIS is equipped with an AI model to support the decision-making process of this collaboration. When an event degrades the performance of CAIS (i.e., a disruptive event), this decision-making process may be hampered or even stopped. Thus, it is of paramount importance to monitor the learning of the AI model, and eventually support its decision-making process in such circumstances. This paper introduces a new methodology to automatically support the decision-making process in CAIS when the system experiences performance degradation after a disruptive event. To this aim, we develop a framework that consists of three components: one manages or simulates CAIS's environment and disruptive events, the second automates the decision-making process, and the third provides a visual analysis of CAIS behavior. Overall, our framework automatically monitors the decision-making process, intervenes whenever a performance degradation occurs, and recommends the next action. We demonstrate our framework by implementing an example with a real-world collaborative robot, where the framework recommends the next action that balances between minimizing the recovery time (i.e., resilience), and minimizing the energy adverse effects (i.e., greenness).

AB  - Designing cyber-physical systems (CPS) is challenging due to the tight interactions between software, network/platform, and physical components. A co-simulation method is valuable to enable early system evaluation. In this paper, a co-simulation framework that considers interacting CPS components for design of time-triggered (TT) CPS is proposed. Virtual prototyping of CPS is the core of the proposed framework. A network/platform model in SystemC forms the backbone of the virtual prototyping, which bridges control software and physical environment. The network/platform model consists of processing elements abstracted by real-time operating systems, communication systems, sensors, and actuators. The framework is also integrated with a model-based design tool to enable rapid prototyping. The framework is validated by comparing simulation results with the results from a hardware-in-the-loop automotive simulator.

AB  - The global demand for food value chains is expanding as the world population grows. It necessitates that food manufacturers streamline their supply chain to satisfy shorter product life cycles, also known as horizontal integration in an Industry 4.0 perspective. On the other hand, a vertical integration from farm production to supply chain planning involves constantly communicating their performance status and responding autonomously via Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) concept for dynamic production requirements. The design and implementation of three layers of CPSs is proposed including farm CPS, farm Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) and Cyber-Physical Supply Chain Planning Systems (CPS2). The farm CPS was managed on the OSIsoft-PI platform, which is based on service-oriented architecture (SOA) and then integrated into the Enterprise Cloud (Microsoft Azure). The CPPS was implemented with data integration, which include farm management such as biosafety, quality control, maintenance management and inventory management. The prediction service in CPPS was also implemented on Azure machine learning service, using data from corporate IT and real-time performance from farm CPS. The case of supply forecast, weekly-monthly pig body weight forecast, was studied. The results reveal that the prediction model can forecast pig body weight and body size ahead from the beginning to the end of the crop farms, separated by seasonal. Finally, the cyber physical system in supply chain planning (CPS2) will be collecting the supply forecast information from all sites and then transform into supply information in corporate level.

AB  - The proposal is to enable students from educational institutions in the United States to attend the CPSWeek 2017 collection of conferences, which are to be held April 18-21, 2017, in Pittsburgh, PA. CPSWeek is an annual international multi-conference for Cyber-Physical Systems, comprising five major multi-day conferences, five one-day workshops, and four one-day tutorials. CPSWeek is the premier conference for cyber physical systems research, and and this year's event will bring more than 700 researchers and attendees.  The conferences moves from country to country each year. Attending the conference will provide students with a unique opportunity to listen and learn from the keynote speeches, presentations, posters and demos on cutting edge topics on cyber-physical systems, and to network with both leaders and other young researchers in this area.  This is the tenth in the series of CPSWeek conferences.CPS research is expected to have positive societal impacts in many areas, including transportation, energy, agriculture, water/sewage treatment, environmental management and manufacturing systems. These systems must operate safely, dependably, securely, efficiently and respond to events in real time. A key feature of CPS research is the requirement to cooperate across disciplines such as computer science, computer architecture and hardware, material science and sensor design, software engineering, networking, and control engineering. In this inherently interdisciplinary field, where collaborations are essential, meeting other researchers is especially important. Strong participation in this event, especially among students (our next generation of researchers) is important to maintaining and advancing CPS research in the US.  The proposal includes a mechanism for student selection based on a research statement and letter from student department.  Priority will be given to under represented minority students studying in the US and to those not presenting at the conference.

TI  - A novel approach for data-driven process and condition monitoring systems on the example of mill-turn centers
T2  - PRODUCTION ENGINEERING-RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Implementing condition monitoring functionality in production machinery often proves to be a difficult task. Device- and process-specific algorithms must be created while inhomogeneous industrial communication networks hinder the aggregation of control signals and process variables. Further challenges arise from the advance of flexible cyber-physical systems (CPS) and the industrial internet of things (IIoT). They demand a service-oriented condition monitoring architecture, which seamlessly adapts to quickly changing production topologies. In this context, data-driven systems which are capable of unsupervised learning are promising approaches. The aim is the autonomous identification of significant process variables and patterns. This paper describes a machine learning approach for a condition and process monitoring system on the basis of pattern recognition within structure-borne noise of rotating cutting machinery. Process states are defined under application of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). A production model is learned and deployed on the basis of Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and hidden Markov models (HMM) in a two stage process. Additionally a generic framework to ease the implementation of decentralized condition monitoring functionalities is given. A decentralized component, the monitoring module, constitutes a part of a holistic condition monitoring architecture managed by a central server. The approach is evaluated on the example of mill-turn centers.

AB  - The creation of cyberphysical systems requires not only the effective education of future engineers in the classroom, but also ongoing training to support life-long learning by practicing engineers, who will continuously face new technologies and challenges. But what topics exactly should this training cover? To answer this question, an analysis was conducted of an online forum used by programmers who create cyberphysical systems with the LabVIEW development environment.This examination of over 150,000 forum message threads has highlighted crucial gaps in the training of practicing engineers, especially in the areas of hardware-software integration, as well as the design and implementation of user interfaces and algorithms. A complementary review of the available online training materials relevant to these topics reveals the need for more systematic support for learning by practicing system engineers. These results provide empirical support for ongoing efforts to provide more effective education of current and future engineers of cyberphysical systems, including through reuse of third-party code and other resources to support learning.

AB  - Recently, Virtual Prototypes (VPs) implemented in SystemC TLM (Transaction-Level Modeling) have been introduced into the growing RISC-V ecosystem to facilitate early software development and testing. However, accurate environment modeling, which is crucial for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), has been mostly neglected to this point.Thus, in this paper, we propose the RISC-V AMS VP framework, that combines an existing open source RISC-V VP with the SystemC AMS (Analog/Mixed Signal) environment modeling style to obtain a RISC-V evaluation platform tailored for CPS. As a case study we created a temperature control system that integrates a sensor and heater component together with a control software. Moreover, we present results on an exemplary fault-injection evaluation that is enabled by bringing together software, hardware and environment models in our unified RISCV AMS VP framework. Finally, we provide the RISC-V AMS VP framework together with the temperature control system as open source to stimulate further research and as foundation for educational purposes.

AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems integrate hardware with software in complex applications. To mitigate the complexity, engineers rely on model-based systems engineering approaches. Updates and function enhancements lead to frequently changing design constraints and objectives. These changes increase the need to rework and extend model artifacts of the system. This can cause quality degradation over time due to modeling errors, knowledge disparities, or a lack of guidelines. To enable efficient collaboration and reduce maintenance costs in model-based systems engineering, the industry needs a cost-efficient, scalable approach to monitor model quality. The work outlines a doctoral thesis investigating the potential of automated data-driven quality assessment strategies using model artifact history and model changes. We will extract metrics and model changes to establish quality feedback for system engineers. We aim to use manual model quality assessments to incorporate domain-specific expert knowledge into the automated strategy. The main goals are to lower the effort of model quality assessments, to provide practitioners with foresight on quality development, and to estimate task effort to improve model quality.

CP  - 5th IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Software Engineering for Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (SEsCPS)
CL  - Montreal, CANADA
AB  - Comprehensible and analyzable models are central to building confidence in cyber-physical systems. Hybrid systems theories, interface theories, formal semantics, concurrent models of computation, component models, and ontologies all augment classical software engineering techniques such as object-oriented design to catch errors and to make systems more modular and composable. However, as systems integrate self-adaptive capabilities and learning algorithms, keeping models comprehensible and analyzable gets challenging.Every model lives within a modeling framework, ideally giving semantics to the model, and many modeling frameworks have been developed that enable rigorous analysis and proof of properties. But every such modeling framework is an imperfect mirror of reality. An engineered system operating in the physical world may or may not accurately reflect behaviors predicted by a model, and the model may not reflect behaviors that are critical to correct operation of the system. Software in a cyber-physical system, for example, has timing properties that are rarely represented in formal models. As artificial intelligence gets more widely used, the problem gets worse, with predictability and explainability seemingly evaporating.In this keynote talk, I examine the strengths and limitations in the use of models. I will show that two very different classes of models are used in practice, classes that I call "scientific models" and "engineering models" [1]. These two classes have complementary properties, and many misuses of models stem from confusion about which class is being used. Scientific models of intelligent systems are very different from engineering models. I will argue that rigorous and analyzable engineering models are useful even in the face of uncertainty and can be used to regulate adaptation and circumscribe the behaviors of learning-based systems.

TI  - Conservative distributed discrete-event simulation on the Amazon EC2 cloud: An evaluation of time synchronization protocol performance and cost efficiency
T2  - SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Distributed execution of simulation models comes into play when memory limitations of a single computational resource prohibit their execution. In addition, the potential for parallel execution of a model on a distributed platform through the integration of multiple computational cores, can potentially reduce the execution time of a simulation. However, such gains can be voided by the overhead that time synchronization protocols for parallel and distributed simulation induce. This overhead is determined by the protocol used, the characteristics of the simulation model, as well as the architectural and performance characteristics of the hardware platform used. Recently, Infrastructure-as-a-Service offerings in the cloud computing domain have introduced flexibility in acquiring access to virtualized hardware platforms on a pay-as-you-go basis. At present, it is however unclear to what extent these offerings are suited for the distributed execution of discrete-event simulations, and how the characteristics of different resource types impact the performance of distributed simulation under different time synchronization protocols. Likewise, it is unclear which type of resources are most cost-efficient for this type of workload. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to investigate these aspects through an assessment of the performance and cost efficiency of different conservative time synchronization protocols on a range of cloud resource types that are currently available on Amazon EC2. Our analysis shows that performance levels comparable to those realized on commodity hardware based-clusters are attainable, and that the relative performance of different synchronization protocols is retained on high-end IaaS resources. In terms of cost-efficiency, we find that IaaS products tailored to traditional cluster workloads do not necessarily constitute the optimal choice, and we assess the impact of different packing configurations for logical processes in this regard.

TI  - Quantitatively assessing the benefits of model-driven development in agent-based modeling and simulation
T2  - SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) paradigm has been used to analyze, reproduce, and predict phenomena related to many application areas. Although there are many agent-based platforms that support simulation development, they rely on programming languages that require extensive programming knowledge. Model-driven development (MDD) has been explored to facilitate simulation modeling, by means of high-level modeling languages that provide reusable building blocks that hide computational complexity, and code generation. However, there is still limited knowledge of how MDD approaches to ABMS contribute to increasing development productivity and quality. We thus in this paper present an empirical study that quantitatively compares the use of MDD and ABMS platforms mainly in terms of effort and developer mistakes. Our evaluation was performed using MDD4ABMS-an MDD approach with a core and extensions to two application areas, one of which developed for this study-and NetLogo, a widely used platform. The obtained results show that MDD4ABMS requires less effort to develop simulations with similar (sometimes better) design quality than NetLogo, giving evidence of the benefits that MDD can provide to ABMS.

TI  - Keeping modelling notebooks with TRACE: Good for you and good for environmental research and management support
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The acceptance and usefulness of simulation models are often limited by the efficiency, transparency, reproducibility, and reliability of the modelling process. We address these issues by suggesting that modellers (1) "trace" the iterative modelling process by keeping a modelling notebook corresponding to the laboratory notebooks used by empirical researchers, (2) use a standardized notebook structure and terminology based on the existing TRACE documentation framework, and (3) use their notebooks to compile TRACE documents that supplement publications and reports. These practices have benefits for model developers, users, and stakeholders: improved and efficient model design, analysis, testing, and application; increased model acceptance and reuse; and replicability and reproducibility of the model and the simulation experiments. Using TRACE terminology and structure in modelling notebooks facilitates production of TRACE documents. We explain the rationale of TRACE, provide example TRACE documents, and suggest strategies for keeping "TRACE Modelling Notebooks."

TI  - Defining and generating multi-level and uncertainty-wise test oracles for cyber-physical systems
T2  - SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS MODELING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) blend digital and physical processes. CPS software is the key to realizing their functionalities. This software needs to evolve to deal with different aspects, such as the implementation of new functionalities or bug fixes. Because of this, design-operation methods, colloquially known as "DevOps," are paramount to be adopted within these systems. During DevOps phases, automating test execution at design time is a key enabler of streamlined software development and software quality improvement. Likewise, monitoring whether a CPS is behaving as expected at operation is similarly important. In DevOps, test oracles play an important role in enabling automated testing, ensuring the reliability of software deployments, providing feedback to developers, etc. However, defining and generating test oracles in the context of DevOps practices in CPSs need to accommodate aspects specific to CPSs, such as their time-continuous behavior and inherent uncertainties. To this end, in this paper, we propose a domain-specific language (DSL) to ease the definition of test oracles and an automated solution for generating a microservice encapsulating the defined test oracles, which is compatible with a DevOps ecosystem for CPSs. We evaluated our DSL with two industrial case study systems and 9 open-source CPSs. Our evaluation results suggest that our DSL can model around 98% of the requirements of these systems through test oracles. Furthermore, it is possible to generate a microservice to be applicable at different test levels within less than 20 min, being fast enough to be adopted in practice.

TI  - Advancing Sustainable Cyber-Physical System Development with a Digital Twins and Language Engineering Approach: Smart Greenhouse Applications
T2  - TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the integration of Internet of Things technologies in smart agriculture has become critical for sustainability and efficiency, to the extent that recent improvements have transformed greenhouse farming. This study investigated the complexity of IoT architecture in smart greenhouses by introducing a greenhouse language family (GreenH) that comprises three domain-specific languages designed to address various tasks in this domain. The purpose of this research was to streamline the creation, simulation, and monitoring of digital twins, an essential tool for optimizing greenhouse operations. A three-stage methodology was employed to develop the GreenH DSLs, a detailed metamodel for enhanced smart monitoring systems. Our approach used high-level metamodels and extended Backus-Naur form notation to define the DSL syntax and semantics. Through a comprehensive evaluation strategy and a selected language usability metrics, the expressiveness, consistency, readability, correctness, and scalability of the DSL were affirmed, and areas for usability improvement were highlighted. The findings suggest that GreenH languages hold significant potential for advancing digital twin modeling in smart agriculture. Future work should be aimed at refining usability and extending its application range. The anticipated integration with additional model-drive engineering and code generation tools will improve interoperability and contribute to digital transformation in the smart greenhouse domain and promote more sustainable food production systems.

TI  - A Digital Twin Platform for Multi-Rotor UAV
T2  - 2021 PROCEEDINGS OF THE 40TH CHINESE CONTROL CONFERENCE (CCC)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)
CL  - Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - A digital twin platform framework for multi-rotor UAV is proposed in this paper. The platform is composed of simulation system, physical UAV and service center, which is designed to solve the problem about UAV advanced capability training and algorithm verification. As we know, a good UAV system verification method is to make full use of virtual simulation before repeated physical tests. However, there is a gap between the virtual simulation and physical test results, because the simulation model is difficult to completely describe the actual physical object. So the hidden risks may exist in actual physical tests by only using the results of virtual simulations. Based on the feedback control idea, the actual state data of the physical UAV is fed back to virtual simulation platform, and the virtual simulation platform completes virtual and real joint training and verification based on this. That is, the technology of digital twin is introduced into the UAV system development process in this paper. In addition, the digital twin platform structure of two-way interaction between virtual space, physical space and service center is proposed. The 4G/5G communication interface is developed to improve the platform's real-time interaction capabilities. Besides, the components of the platform and the construction process are introduced in detail. Finally, three platform test experiments are used to verify the interactive characteristics of the platform and introduce the operating process of the platform.

AB  - This paper is one of a series presented on behalf of the System Operations Subcommittee with the intent of focusing industry attention on current problems faced by electric utilities in the operation of the bulk power system.Five short-note reports are presented which direct attention to the problem areas being experienced by utilities in effective utilization of dispatcher training simulators as part of the overall dispatcher training programs.  Each report focuses on a different aspect of dispatcher training and utilization of power system simulation in the training curriculum.  The first report addresses the justification of a training simulator and focuses on the reasons a utility should incorporate the use of a simulator in the dispatchers' training program.  The second report identifies the issues associated with simulation modelling of the real power system versus generic power system modelling.  The third report describes the problems experienced with usage of a simulator for power system restoration drills.  The fourth report develops a set of criteria for establishing an adequate training staff to support training using a power system simulation tool.  The final report explains the challenges in establishing a facility that is suitable for dispatcher training.  Each of these reports is descriptive of real experiences and is intended to highlight the issues that must be addressed by the utilities in establishing a dispatcher training program and by the industry in developing the tools needed to effectively train dispatchers using power system simulation techniques.  These reports contain representative lessons the industry has learned concerning the use of a dispatcher training simulator.

AB  - Human activity recognition research relies heavily on extensive datasets to verify and validate performance of activity recognition algorithms. However, obtaining real datasets are expensive and highly time consuming. A physics-based virtual simulation can accelerate the development of context based human activity recognition algorithms and techniques by generating relevant training and testing videos simulating diverse operational scenarios. In this paper, we discuss in detail the requisite capabilities of a virtual environment to aid as a test bed for evaluating and enhancing activity recognition algorithms. To demonstrate the numerous advantages of virtual environment development, a newly developed virtual environment simulation modeling (VESM) environment is presented here to generate calibrated multi-source imagery datasets suitable for development and testing of recognition algorithms for context-based human activities. The VESM environment serves as a versatile test bed to generate a vast amount of realistic data for training and testing of sensor processing algorithms. To demonstrate the effectiveness of VESM environment, we present various simulated scenarios and processed results to infer proper semantic annotations from the high fidelity imagery data for human-vehicle activity recognition under different operational contexts.

TI  - Failure Identification Using Model-Implemented Fault Injection with Domain Knowledge-Guided Reinforcement Learning
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The safety assessment of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) requires tremendous effort, as the complexity of cyber-physical systems is increasing. A well-known approach for the safety assessment of CPSs is fault injection (FI). The goal of fault injection is to find a catastrophic fault that can cause the system to fail by injecting faults into it. These catastrophic faults are less likely to occur, and finding them requires tremendous labor and cost. In this study, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method to automatically configure faults in the system under test and to find catastrophic faults in the early stage of system development at the model level. The proposed method provides a guideline to utilize high-level domain knowledge about a system model for constructing the reinforcement learning agent and fault injection setup. In this study, we used the system (safety) specification to shape the reward function in the reinforcement learning agent. The reinforcement learning agent dynamically interacted with the model under test to identify catastrophic faults. We compared the proposed method with random-based fault injection in two case studies using MATLAB/Simulink. Our proposed method outperformed random-based fault injection in terms of the severity and number of faults found.

AB  - CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tools based on the Specification and Description Language (SDL) are nowadays serving increasingly as the engineering platforms for the rapid application development (RAD). This paper presents some general concepts for achieving modelling and simulation of B-ISDN signalling protocols on such an SDL'92 engineering platform (SDL'92 toolset). The designed simulation model is completely specified in SDL'92. The corresponding discrete-event simulator is automatically generated from the SDL'92 specifications. Using the Abstract Data Types (ADT) of SDL'92, the queuing models can be coded within SDL'92 specifications for performance modelling. To make the most of the SDL'92 engineering platform, a working paradigm for developing and verifying a discrete-event simulator is proposed.

TI  - Studying Interrelationships of Safety and Security for Software Assurance in Cyber-Physical Systems: Approach Based on Bayesian Belief Networks
T2  - 2013 FEDERATED CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS (FEDCSIS)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)
CL  - Krakow, POLAND
AB  - The paper discusses mutual relationships of safety and security properties in cyber-physical systems (CPS). Generally, safety impacts the system's environment while environment impacts security of a CPS. Very frequently, safety and security of a CPS interact with each other either synergistically or conflictingly. Therefore, a combined evaluation of safety and security that considers their interrelationships is required for proper assessment of a CPS. Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) can be used for this evaluation where factors related to safety and security of a CPS are assumed to be randomly distributed. The result of this evaluation is an assessment that is non-deterministic in nature but gives a very good approximation of the actual extent of safety and security in a CPS. Using a case study of a SCADA system in an oil pipeline control, the authors present a BBN approach for assessing mutual impacts of security and safety violations. This approach is compared with the Non-Functional Requirements approach (NFR), used previously, which is largely qualitative in nature. This study demonstrates that the BBN approach can significantly complement other techniques for joint assessment of safety and security in CPS.

AB  - This paper presents an efficient best-effort approach for simulation-based timing analysis of complex real-time systems. The method can handle in principle any software design that can be simulated, and is based on controlling simulation input using a simple yet novel hill-climbing algorithm. Unlike previous approaches, the new algorithm directly manipulates simulation parameters such as execution times, arrival jitter and input. An evaluation is presented using six different simulation models, and two other simulation methods as reference: Monte Carlo simulation and MABERA. The new method proposed in this paper was 4-11% more accurate while at the same time 42 times faster on average, than the reference methods.

T2  - ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A variety of modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are distributed and asynchronous systems that are becoming the backbone for smart infrastructures and systems such as smart grids, power plants, medical appliances, social robots etc. The weaving of cyber components with the physical system improves resource utilization and system reliability. However, it makes the CPSs significantly vulnerable to several cyber threats by increasing the attack surfaces. In safety-critical cyber-physical systems, the primary focus is on safety assurance. Any mistake or ignorance in security analysis may greatly amplify the losses in the presence of cyber threats. Such security failure may result in severe damages that may range from affecting critical infrastructures up to even loss of human lives. Thus, an early-staged security modeling of these systems is a prominent issue and requires a systematic approach for modeling a secure design as well as performance evaluation of alternative designs for the same. An in-depth security analysis involves the identification of a standard set of evaluation metrics. The proposed work provides the design-time methodology to map and analyze system security qualitatively and quantitatively using Stochastic Petri nets and their fundamental properties. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is evaluated using a Nuclear power plant (NPP) case study. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition that affects the motor system and can result in tremors, limb rigidity, and gait and balance disorders. Currently, conventional tests consist of a series of spiral drawings, with the notion that the most prevalent PD symptoms directly impact the visual appearance of handwritten geometric dynamics. Current disease diagnosis methods rely heavily on a large amount of preexisting clinical data to train their models. However, the lack of sufficient labeled data samples in many diseases, including PD, makes it challenging to build robust predictive models, especially deep-learning ones. With measuring devices becoming more common and the continuous increase in processing power, industrial cyber-physical characterization is emerging as a key enabling technology for a wide range of fields. This article proposes an industrial cyber-physical deep meta-learning framework for diagnosing and monitoring PD patients based on metric learning that aims to train a reliable PD classifier with limited data. In particular, we present a component-based cyber-physical system architecture to combine contrastive learning with a CNN encoder to obtain unbiased feature embeddings and then use a Siamese network to finalize PD classification. Our technique outperforms pretrained models with few training instances on a publicly available PD dataset of hand-drawn spiral and wave images.

CL  - Guadalajara, MEXICO
AB  - Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). It takes sequences of information and uses recurrent mechanisms and gate techniques. LSTM has many advantages over other feedforward and recurrent NNs in modeling of time series, such as audio and video. However, in non-linear system modeling normal LSTM does not work well(Wang, 2017). In this paper, we combine LSTM with NN, and use the advantages. The novel neural model consists of hierarchical recurrent networks and one multilayer perceptron. We design a special learning algorithm which uses backpropagation, and backpropagation through time methods. We use two non-linear system examples to compare our neural modeling with other well known methods. The results show that for the simulation model (only the test input is used and the past test output is not used), the modified LSTM model proposed in this paper is much better than the other existing neural models.

AB  - A Flexible Data Input Layer Architecture (FDILA) has been designed and developed by Tavakoli et al. [1] for providing a generic tool to transfer data from a wide series of data acquisition devices into higher levels of information processing systems. Data collected by mobile devices such as GPS and PDA applications are among important inputs for evaluating environmental cause-effects. This work discusses issues and proposes components of connecting and interfacing the input layer of a generic decision making tool to mobile application data. Our purpose is to demonstrate issues and tasks for adapting mobile devices to a generic simulation platform that can be used for real-time discrete event simulation modelling. This is based on a tested flexible input data architecture developed in Labview, a real-time intercommunication between the Labview application and a discrete event simulation in Arena. The emphasis is on interactive mobile applications which may submit their data irregularly.

AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) as advanced embedded systems integrating computation with physical process are increasingly penetrating into our life. Modeling and analysis for such systems closely involved with us are actively researched. A current challenging problem is how to take advantages of existing technologies like SysML/MARTE, Modelica and Statistical Model Checking (SMC) through effective integration. Moreover, the lack of efficient methodologies or tools for modeling and analysis of CPSs makes the gap between design and analysis models hard to bridge. To solve these problems, we present a framework named Modana to achieve an integrated process from modeling with SysML/MARTE to analysis with SMC for CPSs in terms of Non-Functional Properties (NFP) such as time, energy, etc. Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI), as a connecting link between modeling and analysis, plays a major role in coordinating various tools for co-simulation to generate traces as the input of statistical model checker. To demonstrate the capability of Modana framework, we model energy-aware buildings as a case study, and discuss the analysis on energy consumption in different scenarios.

T2  - FORMAL ASPECTS OF COMPONENT SOFTWARE, FACS 2023
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 19th International Conference on Formal Aspects of Component Software (FACS)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The International Symposium on Formal Aspects of Component Software (FACS) was inaugurated two decades ago in response to the major software development paradigm shift from structured development and object-oriented development to component-based software development (CBSD) and service-oriented architecture (SOA). FACS is dedicated to fostering a deeper understanding of the distinctive aspects, promoting research, education, technological advancement, and the practical application of CBSD technology. On the 20th anniversary of FACS, it is appropriate to briefly recall its background and history, thereby highlighting its contributions to the community. Taking this opportunity, we focus on the discussion to elucidate the important aspects of component software that require to be and have been considered in formal theories. Leveraging the refinement of component and object-oriented systems (rCOS) as a framework, we provide an overview of these formal theories and discuss their relationships. We intend to express a vision that different theories and methods are required for different aspects in a CBSD process, and also different formal theories are required even for a particular aspect. However, ensuring their consistent application remains a major challenge and this is a main barrier to the effective industry adoption of CBSD. Furthermore, we delineate emerging challenges and prospects associated with integrating formal methods for modelling and design human-cyber-physical systems (HCPS) - hybrid integration encompassing cyber systems, physical systems, and the mixed human and machine intelligence.

AB  - Cyber-physical systems (CPSs), like train control and management systems (TCMS), are becoming ubiquitous in critical infrastructures. As safety-critical systems, ensuring their dependability during operation is crucial. Digital twins (DTs) have been increasingly studied for this purpose owing to their capability of runtime monitoring and warning, prediction and detection of anomalies, etc. However, constructing a DT for anomaly detection in TCMS necessitates sufficient training data and extracting both chronological and context features with high quality. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel method named KDDT for TCMS anomaly detection. KDDT harnesses a language model (LM) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract contexts and chronological features, respectively. To enrich data volume, KDDT benefits from out-of-domain data with knowledge distillation (KD). We evaluated KDDT with two datasets from our industry partner Alstom and obtained the F1 scores of 0.931 and 0.915, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of KDDT. We also explored individual contributions of the DT model, LM, and KD to the overall performance of KDDT, via a comprehensive empirical study, and observed average F1 score improvements of 12.4%, 3%, and 6.05%, respectively.

AB  - This paper describes an environment for performance-oriented design of portable parallel software. The environment consists of a graphical design tool based on the PVM communication library for building parallel algorithms, a state-of-the-art simulation engine and a visualisation tool for animation of program execution and visualisation of platform and network performance measures and statistics. The toolset is used to model a virtual machine composed of a cluster of workstations interconnected by a local area network. The simulation model used is modular and its components are interchangeable which allows easy re-configuration of the platform. The model is validated using experiments on the COMMS1 benchmark from the Parkbench suite, and a standard image processing algorithm with maximum errors of 1% and 10% respectively.

AB  - The increased deployment of information technology for information processing, extensive networking, and system/environment monitoring using sensor and information fusion systems are essential characteristics of cyber-physical systems. They allow an autonomous recognition and evaluation of the system's status leading to autonomous reactions improving or maintaining the status to operate adaptively, robustly, anticipatory, and user-friendly. Assisting the operator in handling such complex systems is rather important and requires self-configuration, self-diagnosis, and self-optimization capabilities. In this paper, a new assisted design methodology for sensor and information fusion systems is proposed. It is based on an innovative system architecture consisting of the information fusion system itself, intelligent adaptable sensors, and the communication architecture of the "Intelligent Technical Systems OstWestfalenLippe" (it's OWL) Leading-Edge Cluster project " Intelligent Networking" providing an intelligent network for self-configuration and the required real-time data exchange.

TI  - Platform-Centric Self-Awareness as a Key Enabler for Controlling Changes in CPS
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
M3  - Article
AB  - Future cyber-physical systems will host a large number of coexisting distributed applications on hardware platforms with thousands to millions of networked components communicating over open networks. These applications and networks are subject to continuous change. The current separation of design process and operation in the field will be superseded by a life-long design process of adaptation, infield integration, and update. Continuous change and evolution, application interference, environment dynamics and uncertainty lead to complex effects which must be controlled to serve a growing set of platform and application needs. Self-adaptation based on self-awareness and self-configuration has been proposed as a basis for such a continuous in-field process. Research is needed to develop automated in-field design methods and tools with the required safety, availability, and security guarantees. The paper shows two complementary use cases of self-awareness in architectures, methods, and tools for cyber-physical systems. The first use case focuses on safety and availability guarantees in self-aware vehicle platforms. It combines contracting mechanisms, tool based self-analysis and self-configuration. A software architecture and a runtime environment executing these tools and mechanisms autonomously are presented including aspects of self-protection against failures and security threats. The second use case addresses variability and long term evolution in networked MPSoC integrating hardware and software mechanisms of surveillance, monitoring, and continuous adaptation. The approach resembles the logistics and operation principles of manufacturing plants which gave rise to the metaphoric term of an Information Processing Factory that relies on incremental changes and feedback control. Both use cases are investigated by larger research groups. Despite their different approaches, both use cases face similar design and design automation challenges which will be summarized in the end. We will argue that seemingly unrelated research challenges, such as in machine learning and security, could also profit from the methods and superior modeling capabilities of self-aware systems.

TI  - Evaluation of simulation-assisted value stream mapping for software product development: Two industrial cases
T2  - INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Value stream mapping (VSM) as a tool for lean development has led to significant improvements in different industries. In a few studies, it has been successfully applied in a software engineering context. However, some shortcomings have been observed in particular failing to capture the dynamic nature of the software process to evaluate improvements i.e. such improvements and target values are based on idealistic situations.Objective: To overcome the shortcomings of VSM by combining it with software process simulation modeling, and to provide reflections on the process of conducting VSM with simulation.Method: Using case study research, VSM was used for two products at Ericsson AB, Sweden. Ten workshops were conducted in this regard. Simulation in this study was used as a tool to support discussions instead of as a prediction tool. The results have been evaluated from the perspective of the participating practitioners, an external observer, and reflections of the researchers conducting the simulation that was elicited by the external observer.Results: Significant constraints hindering the product development from reaching the stated improvement goals for shorter lead time were identified. The use of simulation was particularly helpful in having more insightful discussions and to challenge assumptions about the likely impact of improvements. However, simulation results alone were found insufficient to emphasize the importance of reducing waiting times and variations in the process.Conclusion: The framework to assist VSM with simulation presented in this study was successfully applied in two cases. The involvement of various stakeholders, consensus building steps, emphasis on flow (through waiting time and variance analysis) and the use of simulation proposed in the framework led to realistic improvements with a high likelihood of implementation.

T2  - SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyber-physical systems, such as learning robots and other autonomous systems, employ high-integrity software in their safety-critical control. This software is developed using a range of tools, some of which need to be qualified for this purpose according to international standards. In this article, we first evaluate the state of the art of tool qualification for proof assistants, checkers (e.g., model checkers), and generators (e.g., code generators, compilers) by means of a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis. Our focus is on the qualification of tools in the three mentioned categories. Our objective is to assess under which conditions these tools are already fit or could be made fit for use in the practical engineering and assurance of high-integrity control software. In a second step, we derive a viewpoint and a corresponding range of suggestions for improved tool qualification from the results of our SWOT analysis.2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - DXPCS: a toolbox for model-based diagnosis of dynamic systems using possible conflicts
T2  - PROGRESS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Consistency-based diagnosis is a model-based diagnosis approach for the artificial intelligence community which relies upon models of correct behaviour and allows automatic multiple fault detection and isolation. The theory for static systems diagnosis is well established but there is a lack of free available tools implementing these ideas for dynamic systems, making rather difficult its dissemination. In this work we introduce DxPCs, a software tool capable of performing consistency-based diagnosis of continuous dynamic systems whose models can be represented as a set of algebraic differential equations. The diagnosis approach relies upon the possible conflict concept. DxPCs is able to automatically build the simulation models for each PC. Single-fault and multiple-fault scenarios, for both parametric and additive faults, can be injected, and studied. DxPCs allows the integration of different algorithms for fault detection, residual generation and evaluation, together with an incremental version of the minimal-hitting set algorithm for fault localization. The software architecture, together with performance results for one case study, are provided in this paper.

TI  - Dependability Assessment of SOA-Based CPS With Contracts and Model-Based Fault Injection
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Engineering complex distributed systems is challenging. Recent solutions for the development of cyber-physical systems (CPS) in industry tend to rely on architectural designs based on service orientation, where the constituent components are deployed according to their service behavior and are to be understood as loosely coupled and mostly independent. In this paper, we develop a workflow that combines contract-based and CPS model-based specifications with service orientation, and analyze the resulting model using fault injection to assess the dependability of the systems. Compositionality principles based on the contract specification help us to make the analysis practical. The presented techniques are evaluated on two case studies.

TI  - Usability evaluation of the domain specific language for spatial simulation scenarios
T2  - COGENT ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the results of a usability evaluation initiative conducted on the Domain Specific Language for Spatial Simulation Scenarios (short name DSL3S) and its supporting tools. This language applies a Model-Driven Development approach to spatial simulation, providing model development through the composition of graphical elements and the subsequent transformation to source code. Potential users trained in disciplines related to Geographic Information Systems were exposed for a first time to the language with an introductory exercise. After installing the supporting tools and developing a simple spatial simulation model, participants then evaluated the language and its tools by answering a questionnaire. The results of this evaluation point to a good degree of usability, with particularly positive appreciations of the DSL3S supporting tools. Notwithstanding, participants also show some reluctance in adopting such a development framework, hinting at some reminiscent scepticism towards domain specific modelling languages and Model-Driven Development.

TI  - Graphical modeling notation for data collection and analysis architectures in cyber-physical systems of systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION INTEGRATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrie 4.0 and data analytics blur the separation of operational and information technology that prevailed for industrial automation over the last decades. Decentralized control systems for production plants and robot cells collaborate actively with higher-level systems for big data analytics. In parallel, the complexity of designing and operating a system architecture for data collection and analysis increases dramatically as more experts from different domains get involved. Graphical modeling notations facilitate the design process by formalizing implicit knowledge, but currently do not exist for the combined description of field layer and data analytics. Modeling the system architecture, relevant constraints, and requirements early during the design process can increase the efficiency of the system development and deployment, especially as experts with various backgrounds are involved. In this contribution, a new graphical notation is introduced and evaluated in three industrial case-studies. The notation describes the underlying hardware and software components of cyber-physical systems of systems, the flow of data, and relevant constraints. The evaluation proved that the notation is powerful in supporting the engineering of data collection and analysis architectures in industrial automation. Future work is related to extending the scope of the modeling approach to include safety applications and real-time considerations on the field level.

TI  - Simulation-based HW/SW co-exploration of the concurrent execution of HEVC intra encoding algorithms for heterogeneous multi-core architectures
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The high efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard shows enhanced video compression efficiency at the cost of high performance requirements. To address these requirements different approaches, like algorithmic optimization, parallelization and hardware acceleration can be used leading to a complex design space. In order to find an efficient solution, early design verification and performance evaluation is crucial. Hereby the prevailing methodology is the simulation of the complex HW/SW architecture. Targeting heterogeneous designs, different simulation models have different performance evaluation capabilities making a combined HW/SW co-analysis of the entire system a cumbersome task. To facilitate this co-analysis, we propose a non-intrusive instrumentation methodology for simulation models, which automatically adapts to the model under observation.With the help of this instrumentation methodology we perform the analysis and exploration of different design aspects of a SystemC-based heterogeneous multi-core model of an HEVC intra encoder. In the course of this HW/SW co-analysis various aspects of the parallelization and hardware acceleration of the video coding algorithms are presented and further improved. Due to its cycle accurate nature the developed model is well suited to facilitate various performance evaluations and to drive HW/SW co-optimizations of the explored system, as discussed in this paper.

CP  - International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering (I3CE)
CL  - Orlando, FL
AB  - Although there have been many attempts to increase student engagement and interaction in class through virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR), structural engineering has remained as one of the disciplines that lacks interactive learning. There was an earlier attempt by the authors to improve student learning in structural analysis and dynamics through a student-centric cyber-physical system (SCPS) that reacts to student movement and outcomes structural behavior. This system used mobile devices as sensors and sent data to be processed by a server. As a result, it suffered from the inherent limitation of Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)-lags and instability. Therefore, this paper presents the development of a new SCPS tool with a new system architecture that is much more stable and provide better user experience. This SCPS captures and uses student movement (i.e., walking, turning, and jumping) as point loads on a virtual bridge. As students move around, structural behavior (i.e., deflection) is simulated and visualized in real time.

TI  - Towards a framework of enforcing resilient operation of cyber-physical systems with unknown dynamics
T2  - IET CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS: THEORY & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ensuring that safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs) continue to satisfy correctness and safety specifications even under faults or adversarial attacks is very challenging, especially in the presence of legacy components for which accurate models are unknown to the designer. Current techniques for secure-by-design systems engineering do not provide an end-to-end methodology for a designer to provide real-time assurance for safety-critical CPSs by identifying system dynamics and updating control strategies in response to newly discovered faults, attacks or other changes such as system upgrades. We propose a new methodology, along with an integrated framework implemented in MATLAB to guarantee the resilient operation of safety-critical CPSs with unknown dynamics. The proposed framework consists of three main components. The runtime monitor evaluates the system behaviour on-the-fly against its correctness specifications expressed as signal temporal logic formulas. The model synthesiser incorporates a sparse identification approach that is used to continually update the plant model and control policies to adapt to any changes in the system or the environment. The decision and control module designs a controller to ensure that the correctness specifications are satisfied at runtime. For evaluation, we apply our proposed framework to ensure the resilient operations of two CPS case studies.

AB  - Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are increasingly being used within safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs). It is important to validate both the timing and functional correctness of these systems. However, most approaches in the literature consider guaranteeing only the functionality of the ANN-based controllers. This issue stems largely from the implementation strategies used within common neural network frameworks-their underlying source code is often simply unsuitable for formal techniques such as static timing analysis. As a result, developers of safety-critical CPS must rely on informal techniques, such as measurement-based approaches, to prove correctness, techniques that provide weak guarantees at best. In this letter, we address this challenge. We propose a design pipeline whereby neural networks trained using the popular deep learning framework Keras are compiled to functionally equivalent C code. This C code is restricted to simple constructs that may be analyzed by the existing static timing analysis tools. As a result, if compiled to a suitable time-predictable platform, all execution bounds may be statically derived. To demonstrate the benefits of our approach, we execute an ANN trained to drive an autonomous vehicle around a race track. We compile the ANN to the Patmos time-predictable controller and show that we can derive the worst-case execution timings.

Design/methodology/approach This paper identifies BIM-integrated cyber physical system frameworks, specific to project objectives, comprising of sensors working as physical assets and BIM-based virtual models acting as the cyber component , connected via wired or wireless protocols (e.g. WiFi, Zigbee, near-field communication, mobile-to-mobile, Zwave, 3 G, 4 G, long-term evolution, 5 G and low-power wide-area networks) and their potential applications in decision-making, visual management, logistics and supply chain management, smart building system management and structural performance assessment, etc. Such proposed architectures are evaluated against deciding parameters such as availability, reliability, mobility, performance, management, scalability, interoperability and security and privacy to evaluate their respective efficiencies. Findings This study finds that the underlying aim of planned IoT frameworks is to integrate systems and processes for a better information flow and to initiate shift from silo solutions to a smart ecosystem. The efficiencies of such frameworks are completely subjective to their respective project natures, objectives and requirements.

AB  - Today's highly interconnected and technology reliant environment places greater emphasis on the need for dependably secure systems. This work addresses this problem by detailing a systems security analysis approach for understanding and eliciting security requirements for complex cyber-physical systems. First, a readily understandable description of key architectural analysis definitions and desirable characteristics is provided along with a survey of commonly used security architecture analysis approaches. Next, a tailored version of the System-Theoretic Process Analysis approach for Security (STPA-Sec) is detailed in three phases which supports the development of functional-level security requirements, architectural-level engineering considerations, and design-level security criteria. In particular, these three phases are aligned with the systems and software engineering processes defined in the security processes of NIST SP 800-160. Lastly, this work is important for advancing the science of systems security by providing a viable systems security analysis approach for eliciting, defining, and analyzing traceable security, safety, and resiliency requirements which support evaluation criteria that can be designed-for, built-to, and verified with confidence.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of embedded systems in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT) has amplified the necessity for effective and adaptable software development practices. The challenges encountered in designing and developing these systems stem from the requirement to efficiently integrate advanced computational paradigms like machine learning and fog computing. Their inherent complexity and rigidity often limit the systems' adaptability to evolving requirements and complicate the effective management of feature dependencies, versioning, customization, and configuration in distributed environments.To address these challenges, we propose the FeaMod framework, integrating feature-based modularity with adaptive feature modeling for enhanced efficiency in embedded software design. Using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, FeaMod employs automated feature extraction through advanced static code analysis, facilitating the identification of computational features and requirements from existing codebases. These features are encapsulated in an adaptive feature model (AFM) that encourages code reuse and allows for dynamic configuration and system integration. By introducing a set of rules governing feature relationships, our approach ensures the adaptive nature of the model, enhancing its flexibility in response to changing system requirements, user preferences, and varying environmental conditions.

TI  - Addressing uncertainty in the safety assurance of machine-learning
T2  - FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is increasing interest in the application of machine learning (ML) technologies to safety-critical cyber-physical systems, with the promise of increased levels of autonomy due to their potential for solving complex perception and planning tasks. However, demonstrating the safety of ML is seen as one of the most challenging hurdles to their widespread deployment for such applications. In this paper we explore the factors which make the safety assurance of ML such a challenging task. In particular we address the impact of uncertainty on the confidence in ML safety assurance arguments. We show how this uncertainty is related to complexity in the ML models as well as the inherent complexity of the tasks that they are designed to implement. Based on definitions of uncertainty as well as an exemplary assurance argument structure, we examine typical weaknesses in the argument and how these can be addressed. The analysis combines an understanding of causes of insufficiencies in ML models with a systematic analysis of the types of asserted context, asserted evidence and asserted inference within the assurance argument. This leads to a systematic identification of requirements on the assurance argument structure as well as supporting evidence. We conclude that a combination of qualitative arguments combined with quantitative evidence are required to build a robust argument for safety-related properties of ML functions that is continuously refined to reduce residual and emerging uncertainties in the arguments after the function has been deployed into the target environment.

AB  - The safety of cyber-physical systems rests on the correctness of their monitoring mechanisms. This is problematic if the specification of the monitor is implemented manually or interpreted by unreliable software. We present a verifying compiler that translates specifications given in the stream-based monitoring language Lola to implementations in Rust. The generated code contains verification annotations that enable the Viper toolkit to automatically prove functional correctness, absence of memory faults, and guaranteed termination. The compiler parallelizes the evaluation of different streams in the monitor based on a dependency analysis of the specification. We present encouraging experimental results obtained with monitor specifications found in the literature. For every specification, our approach was able to either produce a correctness proof or to uncover errors in the specification.

AB  - Distributed high-lift system is used to improve aircraft lift characteristic at low speed and it has a major influence on economics and safety of transport aircraft configuration. State-of-the-art distributed high-lift system is a complex mechatronics integrated subsystem and often uses "concentrated control-drive & distributed actuation" architecture. In engineering practice, system architecture design process is highly iterative for the reason of uncertain and changing input. It is also difficulty to assess system architecture and predict system performance. The objective of research is offering a novel knowledge-based system architecture design criterion and system assessment criterion from engineering perspective, other factors with great influences on system architecture design and selection also be discussed synchronously. In order to illustrate system running and execution logic, the article exhibits high-lift system application software's structure and procedure to show system working principle at different modes. Furthermore, according to flap actuation system simulation model building and mechanical transmission error calculation, the article provides a systematic mechanical performance calculation method.

AB  - Driven by the recent technological advancements in the field of artificial intelligence, machine learning has emerged as a promising representation learning and decision-making method in many technological domains. Inspired by impressive these results, now machine learning techniques are also being applied to address the decision-making and control problems in the area of cyber-physical systems. For instance, some of these systems fall under the category of safety-critical systems such as chemical plants, autonomous vehicles, surgical robots, and modern medical equipment. One of the major performance issues related to the applicability of machine learning with safety-critical systems is related to the probability-based prediction nature of machine learning components used within such systems. This particular characteristic of machine learning makes it extremely difficult to guarantee safety as directed by standards such as ISO 26262. More importantly, the non-transparent and complex nature of machine learning algorithms make both the reasoning as well as formally establishing the safety aspects of the underlying system extremely difficult. The objective of this research work is to investigate on this key issue, and further on propose an efficient machine learning methodology based on the mixed-criticality approach feasible to safety-critical systems.

AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have been broadly deployed in safety-critical domains, such as automotive systems, avionics, medical devices, etc. In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been increasingly adopted to control CPS. Despite the popularity of AI-enabled CPS, few benchmarks are publicly available. There is also a lack of deep understanding on the performance and reliability of AI-enabled CPS across different industrial domains. To bridge this gap, we present a public benchmark of industry-level CPS in seven domains and build AI controllers for them via state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. Based on that, we further perform a systematic evaluation of these AI-enabled systems with their traditional counterparts to identify current challenges and future opportunities. Our key findings include (1) AI controllers do not always outperform traditional controllers, (2) existing CPS testing techniques (falsification, specifically) fall short of analyzing AI-enabled CPS, and (3) building a hybrid system that strategically combines and switches between AI controllers and traditional controllers can achieve better performance across different domains. Our results highlight the need for new testing techniques for AI-enabled CPS and the need for more investigations into hybrid CPS to achieve optimal performance and reliability. Our benchmark, code, detailed evaluation results, and experiment scripts are available on https://sites.google.com/view/ai-cps-benchmark.

AB  - Over the past two decades, the value of simulation modeling has been widely recognized. Real time simulation has been extensively used in training applications, in full scope simulators and part task trainers. Non-real time simulation was mainly used for design analysis and verification. Today, with the rapid improvements in computer hardware technology and in computer graphics, and through the use of more advanced modeling techniques, the gap between real time and non-real time simulation has narrowed. Non-real time simulation can be used to create more accurate data for real time simulation while real-time and even faster than real time simulations are finding new applications beyond training.Perhaps the single most important technology advancement, besides increased computer power, comes from the increased usage of icon-based visual programming in system modeling. Also essential to this concept are standard communication mechanisms allowing many tools to exchange data. This paper describes how a complete environment supporting icon-based visual programming can be exploited so that detailed, high-fidelity dynamic simulation can be used in different industries. Users of such an environment do not require computer system programming expertise. The CAE Real-time Object-oriented Software Environment (ROSE(TM)) is described in this context.ROSE(TM) facilitates all aspects of system simulation with an integrated suite of tools. The ROSE(TM) editors allow a user to define a system by placing objects in schematics, while the graphic editor can produce fully dynamic graphical displays. A client/server database allows many developers to work simultaneously on the same system, and an integrated runtime environment facilitates testing and integration. ROSE (TM) also provides a standard open environment facilitating testing and integration. ROSE(TM) also provides a standard open computing platform to allow the user to build simulation models for full scope trainers and permits the re-use of simulation components for mini desktop training applications. An interface to a CAD package and to 3-D visualization technology along with multimedia technology provide new opportunities for addressing today's power plant industry's needs.The same simulation can be applied in many ways within a power plant. Plant process upgrades can first be simulated to verify their impact on the plant, prior to purchasing actual plant. Once the plant has been upgraded, the already developed simulation model can be used on a desktop trainer to provide immediate training to operations personnel. The simulation model can then be easily incorporated into a full scope replica training simulator or located near a control room for easy access training exercises.The marriage of CAD and system modeling within the ROSE(TM) environment also opens new doors for designers. Using industry standard interfaces, we can visualize the design of the system, analyze system behavior in real-time and even merge 3-D visualization with dynamic behavior.

AB  - It is widely established debriefing in business games is important and influences the students' learning performance. Most games only support game statistics instead of explaining solution paths. We suggest the automatic generation of explanations for internet-mediated business games to improve the debriefing quality. As a proof of concept we developed a prototype of an internet-based auction game embedding an open simulation model and an automatic explanation component helping students and teachers to analyse the decision making process. This paper describes the usefulness of automated explanations and the underlying generic software architecture.

TI  - Using Model-to-Model Transformations for Web Software Architecture Simulation
T2  - IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of evaluation methods that allow improving the capture of quality data regarding software architectures is a topic of interest in Software Engineering. However, the dynamic of the traditional methods used for architecture evaluation is not enough to deal with the architectural complexity exhibit in new types of software products (such as cloud and web applications). In this paper, we present a model-to-model mapping based on modeling and simulation techniques that can be used as a complement of the traditional evaluation methods to improve the architecture design of complex systems. Using the set of elements that compose the architecture design of web applications, an abstraction model is designed with the aim to define the basic structure for the equivalent simulation model. Such a simulation model is detailed using two discrete-event formalisms: Discrete Event System Specification and Routed DEVS. In each case, a mapping is proposed to capture the full structure of the architecture with all its complexity. We compare both solutions to judge their applicability. Hence, the main advantages and disadvantages of both approaches are analyzed with the aim to evaluate their use in the architecture design stage of Software Engineering projects related to web applications.

TI  - Bringing Machine Learning Classifiers Into Critical Cyber-Physical Systems: A Matter of Design
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly used by domain experts to tackle classification tasks, aiming for high predictive accuracy. However, classifiers are inherently prone to misclassifications, especially when they encounter unfamiliar, previously unseen or out-of-distribution input data. This creates significant challenges for their deployment in critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs)-such as autonomous vehicles, industrial control systems, and medical devices-where misclassifications can lead to severe consequences for people, infrastructure, and the environment. This paper argues that ML classifiers intended for critical applications should not be designed nor evaluated in isolation. Instead, Critical System Classifiers (CSCs) primarily aim at reducing misclassifications by rejecting uncertain predictions and trigger mitigation strategies integrated into the encompassing CPS. We present a high-level CSC architecture that supports black-box classifier integration, preprocessing for unknown detection, post-hoc calibration, and cost-sensitive thresholding. We emphasize the need for cost-aware evaluation metrics that explicitly account for rejected predictions, enabling a more realistic assessment of classifier performance in critical systems. We validate our approach through experiments on tabular datasets related to failure prediction, intrusion detection, and error detection-common use cases for classifiers in CPSs. Key findings include: 1) cost-sensitive evaluation often leads to the selection of different classifiers than standard metrics suggest; 2) tree-based models outperform statistical ones in classification tasks; 3) calibration and rejection mechanisms provide a robust notion of confidence; and 4) combining multiple uncertainty-based rejection strategies achieves a favorable trade-off between high accuracy, low rejection rates, and cost. All experiments and implementations are publicly available via our CINNABAR GitHub repository. Overall, this study offers a system-level perspective and practical software architecture for safely deploying ML classifiers in critical CPS domains, paving the way toward more trustworthy and certifiable AI in real-world infrastructures.

TI  - Prioritizing code review requests to improve review efficiency: a simulation study
T2  - EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Code review has become a common quality assurance process in modern software development. For large-scale, active software projects emphasizing continuous delivery and fast feedback, one of the main challenges with code review is prioritizing the many Code Review Requests (CRRs) these projects receive. Many heuristic rules and machine learning models have been adopted to develop CRR prioritizers. However, their evaluation was completed before starting code reviews. Such a pre-review evaluation provides few indications about how prioritizing CRRs influences code review efficiency. In this paper, we conduct a simulation study that aims (1) to perform a post-review evaluation on CRR prioritizers, and (2) to evaluate the influence on review efficiency resulting from positions where to pick CRRs, as developers have different review preferences. To achieve the first goal, we use discrete-event simulation-based software process simulation modeling methods to simulate the prioritization-centric code review processes, and we propose new evaluation metrics from the perspectives of completion and delivery to measure code review efficiency. We develop nine prioritizers and use historical review orders as baselines for the post-review evaluation. The experiments using 15 GitHub projects show that (1) prioritizing CRRs helps complete open CRRs and helps deliver closed CRRs, and (2) Random Forest is the best-performing prioritizer. To achieve the second goal, we devise nine positions where a CRR is permitted to be picked from an ordered list every time, and we use Random Forest as the basic prioritizer for the post-review evaluation. The results show that picking a CRR from the top-1 position is better than other positions. Overall, through this simulation study, we provide software organizations with (1) the new evaluation method (post-review evaluation) and metrics (completion and delivery) on CRR prioritizers, and (2) the optimal prioritizer (Random Forest) and position (top-1) to improve code review efficiency.

TI  - Cost risk analysis for instance recommendation in a sustainable Cloud-cyber-physical system framework
T2  - SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud markets advocate powerful instances to take computation over from the cyber-physical system (CPS). Combining the Cloud and CPS layer, the whole Cloud-CPS framework is designed to achieve both accurate data sensing and fast data analysis. While most researchers trust the computation side, and focus on the actuator in the physical space to ensure the service-level objectives, SLO, that is, deadline misses, cloud can be a threat to the service sustainability as instance may fail, especially when one tries to make a cost-effective design. Specifically, users must bear the risk of instance failure. These risks can cause the entire cyber-physical system to collapse. Our work tackles the cloud aspect of the sustainability challenge from the cloud side in a cloud-CPS framework. We have studied the instance selection problem for the CPS systems, and propose a Cost-Risk Analysis for Instance Recommendation, or CRAIR, to support a sustainable Cloud-CPS framework. We have adopted the classic risk analysis process from the portfolio management in hedge financial market, combining with the system modeling for the CPS instance selection, as an optimization problem. To solve this problem, we formulate it as a multi-armed bandit problem and solve it with our upper confidence bound bandit algorithm together, our CRAIR can provide an online risk analysis to maximize the profit with a comparative ratio of O(1+eta). We have evaluated CRAIR based on simulations using real-world Google and Alibaba workloads and cloud market numbers. The results show that, compared to traditional approaches, our approach provides the best tradeoff between SLOs and costs. All users achieve their SLOs goals while minimizing their average expenses by 34.6%. By using CRAIR for instance selection, the CPS service can maximize its benefit under a controlled risk.

TI  - Transfer Learning for Multiobjective Optimization Algorithms supporting Dynamic Software Product Lines

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 25th ACM International Systems and Software Product Line Conference (SPLC)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) are a well-accepted approach for self-adapting Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) at run-time. The DSPL approaches make decisions supported by performance models, which capture system features' contribution to one or more optimization goals. Combining performance models with Multi-Objectives Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) as decision-making mechanisms is common in DSPLs. However, MOEAs algorithms start solving the optimization problem from a randomly selected population, not finding good configurations fast enough after a context change, requiring too many resources so scarce in CPSs. Also, the DSPL engineer must deal with the hardware and software particularities of the target platform in each CPS deployment. And although each system instantiation has to solve a similar optimization problem of the DSPL, it does not take advantage of experiences gained in similar CPS. Transfer learning aims at improving the efficiency of systems by sharing the previously acquired knowledge and applying it to similar systems. In this work, we analyze the benefits of transfer learning in the context of DSPL and MOEAs testing on 8 feature models with synthetic performance models. Results are good enough, showing that transfer learning solutions dominate up to 71% of the non-transfer learning ones for similar DSPL.

AB  - Smart cyber-physical systems (sCPS) is a growing research field focused on scenarios where a set of autonomous software-hardware entities (components) is cooperating via network communication to achieve a type of swarm or cloud intelligence. Typically the components' cooperation is designed at a low level of abstraction and their behavior validated via simulations. As a remedy, a declarative language capable of specifying high-level component ensembles has been proposed in recent work. By capturing component functionality and the cooperation constraints, a specification serves both for generating platform-specific implementation and as a model@run.time to support self-adaption via dynamic formation of ensembles. However, for a particular specification, multiple possible architectural configurations exist with various impact on the system. Given their typically large number, we select the best one via an SMT solver. In this paper, we show that scalability of such approach can be supported by exploiting the effect of locality in component cooperation and by hoisting specific domain knowledge to the level of architecture.

AB  - The ongoing digital transformation of industry is most clearly reflected in the increasing collection and analysis of data from various sources. Among these are sensor equipped machinery, telemetry in logistics or audiovisually monitored production floors. In order to utilize the data, e.g., to predict machinery malfunctions, its technically smooth consolidation is crucial. Therefore, numerous data interchange formats, protocols and middleware emerged over the past years. However, until today there is no gold standard technology stack for industrial data analysis, for multiple reasons, including the applications' heterogeneity.In this work, we present a software library which aims at decoupling messaging protocols and patterns from their implementation to overcome incompatibilities and, thus, facilitate data consolidation for software engineers. Moreover, we show how to use the library for rapidly modeling distributed cyber-physical systems using an integrated schema generation mechanism. Based on one real-world and one synthetic use case, we evaluate the library's applicability, discuss open issues and outline planned features. (C) 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper illustrates how the CESIUM simulation tool carl be used for design and performance evaluation fault-tolerant and real-time systems, in addition to testing the correctness of protocol implementations. We calibrate three increasingly accurate simulation models of a network of work-stations using independently-obtained data. For a sample group membership protocol, the predictions of the simulator are very close to the actual performance measured in the real system. We also apply CESIUM to the evaluation of two potential improvements for the protocol, performing experiments that would have been difficult to implement in the real system. The results of the simulations give us valuable insight on how to tune configuration parameters, as well as on the performance gains of the improved versions. Our experience shows that CESIUM can be used to develop best-effort services which adapt their quality of service according to the failures that occur during operation.

T2  - FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to fulfill the requirements like stringent timing restraints and demand on resources, Cyber-Physical System (CPS) must deploy on the virtualized environment such as cloud computing. To protect Virtual Machines (VMs) in which CPSs are functioning against malware-based attacks, malware detection and mitigation technique is emerging as a highly crucial concern. The traditional VM-based anti-malware software themselves a potential target for malware-based attack since they are easily subverted by sophisticated malware. Thus, a reliable and robust malware monitoring and detection systems are needed to detect and mitigate rapidly the malware based cyber-attacks in real time particularly for virtualized environment. The Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) has emerged as a fine-grained out-of-VM security solution to detect malware by introspecting and reconstructing the volatile memory state of the live guest Operating System (OS) by functioning at the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) or hypervisor. However, the reconstructed semantic details by the VMI are available in a combination of benign and malicious states at the hypervisor. In order to distinguish between these two states, extensive manual analysis is required by the existing out-of-VM security solutions. To address the foremost issue, in this paper, we propose an advanced VMM-based guest-assisted Automated Multilevel Malware Detection System (AMMDS) that leverages both VMI and Memory Forensic Analysis (MFA) techniques to predict early symptoms of malware execution by detecting stealthy hidden processes on a live guest OS. More specifically, the AMMDS system detects and classifies the actual running malicious executables from the semantically reconstructed process view of the guest OS. The two sub-components of the AMMDS are: Online Malware Detector (OMD) and Offline Malware Classifier (OFMC). The OMD recognizes whether the running processes are benign or malicious using its Local Malware Signature Database (LMSD) and online malware scanner and the OFMC classify unknown malware by adopting machine learning techniques at the hypervisor. The AMMDS has been evaluated by executing large real-world malware and benign executables on to the live guest OSs. The evaluation results achieved 100% of accuracy and zero False Positive Rate (FPR) on the 10-fold cross-validation in classifying unknown malware with maximum performance overhead of 5.8%.

TI  - Integrating Life Cycle Assessment and Agent-Based Modeling: A Dynamic Modeling Framework for Sustainable Agricultural Systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - As food demand increases, it is critical to develop effective strategies and evaluate their potential in reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental footprints of large-scale agricultural systems. This study addresses the challenge by developing a dynamic system modeling framework integrating Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), and Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA). LCA and TEA were coupled with dynamic simulation models of crop yields, costs, and prices, allowing for the estimation of life-cycle environmental impacts and profitability of crop planting activities under changing climate and economic conditions. The framework was demonstrated by a case study for an agricultural system, including 1,000 farms in the United States over a 30-year time frame. The results indicated that information exchange among farmers, farmers' environmental awareness, access to environmental information, and farm size are key factors driving the system's environmental impacts. The results can provide a broad range of stakeholders (e.g., policymakers, nonprofits, agriculture companies) with insightful information to tailor their strategies for effectively managing the environmental footprints of large-scale agricultural systems. The integrated modeling framework has the potential to address sustainability challenges in other systems that are dynamic, involve human behaviors, and have complex interactions among human and nature systems.

AB  - Modern systems' transition towards more connected, information and communication technologies (ICT) has increased the safety, capacity and reliability of systems such as transport systems (railways, automotive) and industrial systems but it has also exposed a big additional surface for cyber attackers which makes it necessary to take in consideration general IT security concerns. Cyber-physical systems need more effort to consider safety critical IT security concerns. The safety impact of security compromises is evaluated in a semiquantitative manner because it is a relatively new area so there is not enough real data available to analyse attack rates quantitatively and the attack-vulnerability scenario is constantly changing because of adversary intelligence. This paper proposes an approach for the quantification of vulnerabilities based on learning from data obtained by concrete pattern implementations in safety-critical systems. This will allow combined analysis of safety and security.

AB  - Ensembles of autonomic components are a novel software engineering paradigm for development of open-ended distributed highly dynamic software systems (e.g. smart cyber-physical systems). Recent research centered around the concept of ensemble-based systems resulted in design and development models that aim to systematize and simplify the engineering process of autonomic components and their ensembles. These methods highlight the importance of covering both the functional concepts and the non-functional properties, specifically performance-related aspects of the future systems. In this paper we propose an integration of the emerging techniques for performance assessment and awareness into different stages of the development process. Our goal is to aid both designers and developers of autonomic component ensembles with methods providing performance awareness throughout the entire development life cycle (including runtime).

TI  - Model-Based Assessment of Tissue Perfusion and Temperature in Deep Hypothermic Patients
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest is necessary for some types of cardiac and aortic surgery. Perfusion of the brain can be maintained using a heart-lung machine and unilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion. Cooling rates during extracorporeal circulation depend on local perfusion. A core temperature of 24 degrees C-25 degrees C is aimed at to extend ischemic tolerance of tissues. Information on cerebral perfusion and temperature is important for the safety of patients, but hardly accessible to measurement. A combined simulation model of hemodynamics and temperature is presented in this paper. The hemodynamics model employs the transmission-line approach and integrates the Circle of Willis (CoW). This allows for parameterization of individual aberrations. Simulation results of cerebral perfusion are shown for two configurations of the CoW. The temperature model provides spatial information on temperature fields. It considers heat transfer in the various tissues retrieving data of local tissue perfusion from the hemodynamics model. The combined model is evaluated by retrospective simulation of two aortic operations.

TI  - A Novel Adversarial FDI Attack and Defense Mechanism for Smart Grid Demand-Response Mechanisms
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article focuses on enhancing the cybersecurity of cyber-physical systems, with a particular emphasis on the False Data Injection (FDI) attack within the Demand Response (DR) mechanism in smart grids. DR seeks to introduce flexibility in consumers' electricity consumption through dynamic pricing or financial incentives, aiming to optimize the equilibrium between supply and demand. The vulnerability of DR to FDI attacks becomes particularly evident when considering its reliance on accurate demand data. In emphasizing the importance of fortifying DR's security against FDI, the Ensemble and Transfer Adversarial Attack (ETAA) based on Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) techniques is proposed. This method facilitates the injection of false data with reduced detectability by existing neural network-based detection method. With the general framework of ETAA, any gradient-based adversarial attack method can be integrated to achieve enhanced attack transferability across diverse detection models. To counteract such attacks, the training process of detection models is refined through three key steps: Gaussian noise injection, latent feature combination and probability margin enlargement. Evaluation results demonstrate that the ETAA method executes FDI attacks with a higher success rate compared to benchmark methods. Furthermore, defensive training contributes to elevating the performance of detection models, ensuring higher standard accuracy, and reducing the success rate of AML attacks. This paper underscores the critical need to enhance the security of DR mechanisms to mitigate the impact of sophisticated FDI attacks on the robustness of smart grids.

AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are increasingly used in various safety-critical domains; assuring the safety of these systems is of paramount importance. Fault Injection is known as an effective testing method for analyzing the safety of CPSs. However, the total number of faults to be injected in a CPS to explore the entire fault space is normally large and the limited budget for testing forces testers to limit the number of faults injected by e.g., random sampling of the space. In this paper, we propose DELFASE as an automated solution for fault space exploration that relies on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for optimizing the identification of critical faults, and can run in two modes: active and passive. In the active mode, an active learning technique called ranked batch-mode sampling is used to select faults for training the GAN model with, while in the passive mode those faults are selected randomly. The results of our experiments on an adaptive cruise control system show that compared to random sampling, DELFASE is significantly more effective in revealing system weaknesses. In fact, we observed that compared to random sampling that resulted in a fault coverage of around 10%, when using the active and passive modes, the fault coverage of DELFASE could be as high as 89% and 81%, respectively.

TI  - Statistical Verification using Surrogate Models and Conformal Inference and a Comparison with Risk-Aware Verification
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainty in safety-critical cyber-physical systems can be modeled using a finite number of parameters or parameterized input signals. Given a system specification in Signal Temporal Logic (STL), we would like to verify that for all (infinite) values of the model parameters/input signals, the system satisfies its specification. Unfortunately, this problem is undecidable in general. Statistical model checking (SMC) offers a solution by providing guarantees on the correctness of CPS models by statistically reasoning on model simulations. We propose a new approach for statistical verification of CPS models for user-provided distribution on the model parameters. Our technique uses model simulations to learn surrogate models, and uses conformal inference to provide probabilistic guarantees on the satisfaction of a given STL property. Additionally, we can provide prediction intervals containing the quantitative satisfaction values of the given STL property for any user-specified confidence level. We compare this prediction interval with the interval we get using risk estimation procedures. We also propose a refinement procedure based on Gaussian Process (GP)-based surrogate models for obtaining fine-grained probabilistic guarantees over sub-regions in the parameter space. This in turn enables the CPS designer to choose assured validity domains in the parameter space for safety-critical applications. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique on several CPS models.

TI  - Complying with ISO 26262 and ISO/SAE 21434: A Safety and Security Co-Analysis Method for Intelligent Connected Vehicle
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A cyber-physical system (CPS) integrates communication and automation technologies into the operational processes of physical systems. Nowadays, as a complex CPS, an intelligent connected vehicle (ICV) may be exposed to accidental functional failures and malicious attacks. Therefore, ensuring the ICV's safety and security is crucial. Traditional safety/security analysis methods, such as failure mode and effect analysis and attack tree analysis, cannot provide a comprehensive analysis for the interactions between the system components of the ICV. In this work, we merge system-theoretic process analysis (STPA) with the concept phase of ISO 26262 and ISO/SAE 21434. We focus on the interactions between components while analyzing the safety and security of ICVs to reduce redundant efforts and inconsistencies in determining safety and security requirements. To conquer STPA's abstraction in describing causal scenarios, we improved the physical component diagram of STPA-SafeSec by adding interface elements. In addition, we proposed the loss scenario tree to describe specific scenarios that lead to unsafe/unsecure control actions. After hazard/threat analysis, a unified risk assessment process is proposed to ensure consistency in assessment criteria and to streamline the process. A case study is implemented on the autonomous emergency braking system to demonstrate the validation of the proposed method.

AB  - Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) are data acquisition/ analysis systems for predictive maintenance. The IMS provide autonomously (or semi-autonomously) diagnoses, prognostics and health assessment of components. In these systems, factors such as data acquisition and visualization from equipments are very important. In this context, this study has used a Cyber-Physical Systems (or CPS) approach to consider the various aspects present into a maintenance environment. The CPS is a new paradigm that seeks to combine and coordinate physical and computational elements. In this paper, we propose a 2D/3D visualization tool for cyber-physical maintenance environments. This tool works under HTTP protocol and makes possible the real-time visualization and remotely access, allowing users to view, to edit and to access the maintenance data via web browser.

TI  - Improving simulation specification with MBSE for better simulation validation and reuse
T2  - SYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - A simulation can be a complex architecture of simulation models, simulation tools, and computing hardware. However, its development often relies on informal procedures and can begin without a clear, complete, and formal definition of the simulation needs. Simulation traceability is then compromised, which prevents from easily validating whether a simulation meets the needs, or understanding the purpose of a simulation model that can be reused. This paper proposes an approach to improve the definition of simulation needs using Model-Based Systems Engineering. Based on the semi-automatic processing of a system architecture, it presents a new method to formulate a so-called "simulation request" which covers (1) the part of the system to be simulated; (2) the objective of the simulation; (3) the simulation quality, cost, and delivery; (4) the test scenarios; (5) the data for simulation calibration and validation; and (6) the verification and validation of the simulation. All the tooling required for the formulation of the simulation request were prototyped in a SysML editor, with machine learning capabilities for the choice of test scenarios. The method and tooling were tested for the case of an autonomous car passing under traffic lights.

AB  - One of the ultimate goals of software engineering is to leave virtual spaces and move real things. We take one step toward supporting users with this goal by connecting a type-based synthesis algorithm, Combinatory Logic Synthesizer ((CL)S), and its IDE to a logistics lab environment. The environment is built and used by domain experts, who have little or no training in formal methods, and need to cope with large spaces of software, hardware and problem specific solution variability. It consists of a number of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), including wheel-driven robots as well as flying drones, and it has laser-based support to visualize their possible movements. Our work describes results on an experiment integrating the latter with (CL)S. Possibilities and challenges of working in the domain of logistics and in cooperation with its experts are outlined. Future research plans are presented and an invitation is made to join the effort of building better, formally understood, development tools for CPS-enabled industrial environments.

TI  - Architecting an Agent-Based Fault Diagnosis Engine for IEC 61499 Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems
T2  - FUTURE INTERNET
M3  - Article
AB  - IEC 61499 is a reference architecture for constructing Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS). However, current function block development environments only provide limited faultfinding capabilities. There is a need for comprehensive diagnostic tools that help engineers identify faults, both during development and after deployment. This article presents the software architecture for an agent-based fault diagnostic engine that equips agents with domain-knowledge of IEC 61499. The engine encourages a Model-Driven Development with Diagnostics methodology where agents work alongside engineers during iterative cycles of design, development, diagnosis and refinement. Attribute-Driven Design (ADD) was used to propose the architecture to capture fault telemetry directly from the ICPS. A Views and Beyond Software Architecture Document presents the architecture. The Architecturally-Significant Requirement (ASRs) were used to design the views while an Architectural Trade-off Analysis Method (ATAM) evaluated critical parts of the architecture. The agents locate faults during both early-stage development and later provide long-term fault management. The architecture introduces dynamic, low-latency software-in-loop Diagnostic Points (DPs) that operate under the control of an agent to capture fault telemetry. Using sound architectural design approaches and documentation methods, coupled with rigorous evaluation and prototyping, the article demonstrates how quality attributes, risks and architectural trade-offs were identified and mitigated early before the construction of the engine commenced.

AB  - Energy performance assessments (EPAs) are widely conducted on buildings, which consume considerable energy and emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases. However, manual-based traditional EPA methods can cause serious problems, such as recurrent and error-prone data replication, data leaks, and redundant data processing and storage. Building information modeling (BIM), as an integrated repository of information about a particular building, has been applied to EPAs to overcome those problems. Although BIM has the potential to increase work efficiency in the assessment process, low interoperability between BIM data and energy simulation models raises huge barriers to reliable BIM-based EPAs.This research aims to improve the interoperability of BIM-based EPAs by developing an environment that contains a process, a materials library, and an EPA support system that connects BIM and energy modeling. To validate the suggested environment, we conducted a case study, and the results show that the proposed environment greatly contributes to increased accuracy and efficiency in the EPA with high interoperability.

TI  - Towards Digital Twin-enabled DevOps for CPS providing Architecture-Based Service Adaptation & Verification at Runtime

AB  - Background: Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPSS) denote a service-oriented way of providing access to cyber-physical systems' (CPS) capabilities. The design of such systems bears high risk due to uncertainty in requirements related to service function and behavior, operation environments, and evolving customer needs. Such risks and uncertainties are well known in the IT sector, where DevOps principles ensure continuous system improvement through reliable and frequent delivery processes. A modular and service-oriented system architecture complements these processes to facilitate IT system adaptation and evolution.Objective: This work proposes a method to use and extend the Digital Twins (DTs) of IPSS assets for enabling the continuous optimization of CPS service delivery and the latter's adaptation to changing needs and environments. This reduces uncertainty during design and operations by assuring IPSS integrity and availability, especially for design and service adaptations at CPS runtime.Methodology: The method builds on transferring IT DevOps principles to DT-enabled CPS IPSS. The chosen design approach integrates, reuses, and aligns the DT processing and communication resources with DevOps requirements derived from literature.Results: We use these requirements to propose a DT-enabled self-adaptive CPS model, which guides the realization of DT-enabled DevOps in CPS IPSS. We further propose detailed design models for operation-critical DTs that integrate CPS closed-loop control and architecture-based CPS adaptation. This integrated approach enables the implementation of A/B testing as a use case and central concept to enable CPS IPSS service adaptation and reconfiguration.Conclusion: The self-adaptive CPS model and DT design concept have been validated in an evaluation environment for operation-critical CPS IPSS. The demonstrator achieved sub-millisecond cycle times during service A/B testing at runtime without causing CPS operation interferences and downtime.

AB  - Future X-by-Wire systems will require both fault-tolerance and a reliable power supply. These properties or subsystems, which have been developed so far as system-specific and often separate from the application, must be integrated in the future into a universally applicable development process in order to ensure a seamless process.This is possible by using a model-based software development process. By adding simulation models of the vehicle electrical system and the hardware architecture (redundancies, for example), system behavior can be evaluated as a whole, and its interactions with other systems can be analyzed even in early phases of development.The aim of this paper is to show the extent in which the simulation-based approach supports the developer in system design with regard to fault-tolerance and power management, and whether or not a seamless development process can be implemented by means of the automated code generation associated with such an approach.The findings obtained for this are described using an X-by-Wire research vehicle as an example.

TI  - Modeling SAR Observables by Combining a Crop-Growth Model With Machine Learning
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, our aim is to estimate synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observables, such as backscatter in VV and VH polarizations, as well as the VH/VV ratio, cross ratio, and interferometric coherence in VV, from agricultural fields. In this study, we use the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT) crop-growth simulation model to simulate parcel-level phenological and growth parameters for over 1500 parcels of silage maize in the Netherlands. The crop model was calibrated using field data, including silage maize phenological phases, leaf area index, and above-ground dry biomass (AGB). The simulations incorporate fine-resolution gridded precipitation data and soil parameters to model the interaction between soil-plant-atmosphere and genotype in DSSAT. The crop variables produced by DSSAT are then used as inputs to a support vector regression model. This model is trained to simulate SAR observables in 2017, 2018, and 2019, and its performance is evaluated using independent fields in each of these years. The results show a close fit between modeled and observed SAR C-band observables. The importance of vegetation variables in the estimation of SAR observables is assessed. The AGB showed significant importance in the estimation of backscatter. This study demonstrates the potential value of combining crop-growth simulation models and machine learning to simulate SAR observables. For example, the SVR model developed here could be used as an observation operator in an assimilation context to constrain vegetation and soil water dynamics in a crop-growth model.

TI  - Simulation of a Direct Time-of-Flight LiDAR-System
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The simulation of a direct time-of-flight flash light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system is crucial for the assessment of the system performance during sensor development. However, due to the number of components of the LiDAR system and the optical signal path and their parameter uncertainty, simulation models are often difficult to validate. In this article, a simulation model is proposed, which extends the statistical simulation of the direct time-of-flight method and incorporates different sensor characteristics. Based on a Poisson process with a subsequent Monte Carlo simulation, various detector types are implemented to examine the detection behavior during prototype construction. The detector types considered here include the single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD), the SPAD array, the silicon photomultipliers (SiPM), and the SiPM array. These are simulated in interaction with a LiDAR system, which in addition to the sensor consists of the emitter, signal path, object, and receiver optics modules. Each of them is defined by several individual system parameters. After derivating the photon detection rate, the implementation of the detector-specific parameters, such as dead time, afterpulsing, crosstalk, and threshold, are considered in more detail. Nonideal tunings during prototyping, which are accompanied by the consideration of the pulse shape, the illuminated/observed object area, as well as the actually used detector area, are also considered.

TI  - Efficient Safe Control via Deep Reinforcement Learning and Supervisory Control - Case Study on Multi-Robot
T2  - IFAC PAPERSONLINE
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 16th IFAC Workshop on Discrete Event Systems (WODES)
CL  - Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC
AB  - Safe control has recently attracted much attention due to its applications in safetycritical cyber-physical systems. Supervisory control theory (SCT) is a formal control method that provides correct-by-construction safety certificates, but is computationally inefficient when the number of system components is large. On the other hand, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides a toolbox of efficient algorithms to compute control decisions even for very large state space, but does not always guarantee safety. In this paper, we propose to synergize SCT and DRL into a new efficient safe control approach. Specifically, we first employ DRL algorithms to efficiently compute sub-optimal solutions which may be unsafe; then we convert the obtained solutions into a standard supervisory control problem with an automaton (plant model) and a set of unsafe states (safety specification); finally we use SCT to synthesize a supervisor with a safety certificate. A case study of multi-robot warehouse logistic automation is conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of this proposed approach. Copyright (C) 2022 The Authors.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE 18th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (IEEE CASE)
CL  - Mexico City, MEXICO
AB  - Complex safety-critical cyber-physical systems, such as autonomous cars or collaborative robots, are becoming increasingly common. Simulation-based falsification is a testing method for uncovering safety hazards of such systems already in the design phase. Conventionally, the falsification method takes the form of a static optimization. Recently, dynamic optimization methods such as reinforcement learning have gained interest for their ability to uncover harder-to-find safety hazards. However, these methods may converge to risk-maximising, but irrelevant behaviors. This paper proposes a principled formulation and solution of the falsification problem by automata constrained reinforcement learning, in which rewards for relevant behavior are tuned via Lagrangian relaxation. The challenges and proposed methods are demonstrated in a use-case example from the domain of industrial human-robot collaboration, where falsification is used to identify hazardous human worker behaviors that result in human-robot collisions. Compared to random sampling and conventional approximate Q-learning, we show that the proposed method generates equally hazardous, but at the same time more relevant testing conditions that expose safety flaws.

TI  - Identifying safety issues from energy conservation requirements
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE-EVOLUTION AND PROCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In cyber-physical systems such as robots and automated vehicles that rely heavily on batteries, safety, and energy conservation can result conflicting requirements when not considered together. In systems engineering, the development begins at a concept phase where we have high-level information of different components of the system. During the concept phase, we perform hazard analysis and risk assessment, define safety goals, and derive safety requirements. This means requirement engineering occurs at the end of the concept phase. However, energy conservation recommendations are not taken into consideration until the detailed design with specific hardware and software is known. Hence, it is possible to recommend energy conservation behaviors that can compromise system's safety. If we perform a trade-off analysis between safety and energy conservation at a concept phase, we can propose various design alternatives and choose the best one that offers a safe and energy saving architecture. To achieve this goal, we propose an approach for identifying safety issues that can be caused by energy conservation recommendations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we performed an empirical study on four robotic systems. Our results show that we can find energy conservation recommendations that can compromise safety at a concept phase.

TI  - Smartphone sensors-based human activity recognition using feature selection and deep decision fusion
T2  - IET CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS: THEORY & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activity recognition (HAR) with smartphone sensors is a significant research direction in human-cyber-physical systems. Aiming at the problem of feature redundancy and low recognition accuracy of HAR, this paper presents a novel system architecture comprising three parts: feature selection based on an oppositional and chaos particle swarm optimization (OCPSO) algorithm, multi-input one-dimensional convolutional neural network (MI-1D-CNN) utilizing time-domain and frequency-domain signals, and deep decision fusion (DDF) combining D-S evidence theory and entropy. The proposed architecture is evaluated on the UCI HAR and WIDSM datasets. The results highlight that OCPSO performs better than particle swarm optimization (PSO) in feature selection, convergence speed, and recognition accuracy. Moreover, it is shown that for the MI-1D-CNN classifier, the frequency-domain signals (95.96%) perform better than time-domain signals (95.66%). In addition, this paper investigates the impact of the convolution layers, feature maps, filter sizes, and decision fusion methods on recognition accuracy. The results demonstrate that the DDF method (97.81%) outperforms single-layer decision fusion in improving the recognition accuracy on the UCI HAR dataset.

AB  - In this paper, we report on the progress made to upgrade and develop a stable upgrading process to the INTO-CPS Application, an Electron.js based desktop application providing a front-end to an INtegrated TOolchain, which is used to develop Cyber-Physical Systems models. We added regression tests to the codebase and for the first time can detect the loss of functionality of the application and its accompanying training tutorials using an automated process. The tests were developed on top of the Mocha, Chai and Spectron frameworks and cover all the tutorials steps performed in the desktop application (approximately 33% of the app and other tools total). The testing process is not yet ready to be deployed in the also recently developed GitHub Actions automated workflow, but this is a possibility to be considered in future developments. We expect this work to improve the stability and security of the code, thus improving user experience.

TI  - Territorial Space Optimization Method Based on Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm and FLUS Model
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rational planning of territorial space is related to the speed of economic development and the protection of ecology. There is an urgent need for a more advanced integrated territorial space layout method. For additional spatial layout design, the study suggests a multi-objective genetic algorithm based on spatial data prediction and coupled with land simulation modeling in the context of big data and machine learning development. The innovation of the research lies in the optimization of the multi-objective genetic algorithm by improving the crossover and mutation process of genetic operators, enhancing the adaptability of the algorithm in dynamic environments, and improving the prediction accuracy of the spatial quantity structure of the national territory. The outcomes revealed that this approach was applied to the prediction of populations of different sizes 400 and 600 with an average accuracy of 67%, which was 17% higher than that of the traditional genetic algorithm. The difference between the predicted and actual future spatial population values using the proposed algorithm was less than 2%, which was 56.5% lower than the other two prediction algorithms on average. The proposed land simulation model reached the highest accuracy at 100 iterations with an average fitness of $2.4\times 10 <^>{11}$ , which was 13% and 27% higher than the other two traditional neural network algorithms, respectively. In the two simple functions of f1 and f2, the highest convergence accuracy reached $10<^>{-30}$ and $10<^>{-10}$ , respectively. In the two more complicated functions of f3 and f4, the optimal solutions were approximated in the ranges of [ $10<^>{2}$ , $10<^>{12}$ ] and [ $10<^>{-2}$ , $10<^>{6}$ ] without significant fluctuations. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can effectively predict the number of territorial space in macro and micro simulation, and has high feasibility and accuracy. This provides a reliable basis for the government to carry out land resource planning, and promotes the sustainable development of ecology and economy.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th International Conference on Rigorous State-Based Methods (ABZ)
CL  - Ulm, GERMANY
AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are multi-component systems that interact with the real world. Their heterogeneous nature makes them particularly difficult to model and prove. Our work proposes a framework allowing to design complex hybrid systems based on decomposition using formally verified architectural patterns. It relies on a proof and refinement-based, correct-by-construction approach with Event-B. In particular, the generic model developed in our previous work is used as a base for defining different patterns, for modelling different architectures of systems. Three architectural patterns are presented, corresponding to simple, centralised and distributed control: one controller controlling one plant, one controller controlling several plants and several controllers controlling several plants. The progressive development of the proposed patterns and their application to specific hybrid systems allows to prove the required safety properties by introducing invariants, decomposing and balancing the proof effort at every step of the development. An assessment of the proposed architectural patterns is undertaken: different designs of the same case study are used to demonstrate the feasibility, reliability and extensibility of our approach to model and designing different classes of controllers.

TI  - Consumer Transactions Simulation Through Generative Adversarial Networks Under Stock Constraints in Large-Scale Retail
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the rapidly evolving domain of large-scale retail data systems, envisioning and simulating future consumer transactions has become a crucial area of interest. It offers significant potential to fortify demand forecasting and fine-tune inventory management. This paper presents an innovative application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic retail transaction data, specifically focusing on a novel system architecture that combines consumer behavior modeling with stock-keeping unit (SKU) availability constraints to address real-world assortment optimization challenges. We diverge from conventional methodologies by integrating SKU data into our GAN architecture and using more sophisticated embedding methods (e.g., hyper-graphs). This design choice enables our system to generate not only simulated consumer purchase behaviors but also reflects the dynamic interplay between consumer behavior and SKU availability-an aspect often overlooked, among others, because of data scarcity in legacy retail simulation models. Our GAN model generates transactions under stock constraints, pioneering a resourceful experimental system with practical implications for real-world retail operation and strategy. Preliminary results demonstrate enhanced realism in simulated transactions measured by comparing generated items with real ones using methods employed earlier in related studies. This underscores the potential for more accurate predictive modeling.

AB  - Simulation is an educational tool that is commonly used to teach processes that are infeasible to practice in the real world. Software process education is a domain that has not yet taken full advantage of the benefits of simulation. To address this, we have developed SimSE, an educational, interactive, graphical environment for building and simulating software engineering processes in a game-like setting. We detail the design of SimSE, present an initial simulation model of a waterfall process that we developed, and describe an experiment that we conducted to evaluate the educational potential of SimSE and its initial model.

AB  - The systematic evaluation of ideas by experiments are the foundation of continuous experimentation. It allows to assess the value of an idea, remove guessing and subjective opinions from the discussion. The enormous interest of it by practitioners and researchers let the body of knowledge consistently grow. New framework, methods and techniques are developed and its application is constantly expanded to new fields like cyber-physical systems or social networks.In this paper we present a systematic mapping study to characterize the current state of research on continuous experimentation. Our study analyzes the following aspects: intensity of research activity and industry-academia collaboration, influential authors and publications, frequent research types and topics, kind of contributions and terms used for continuous experimentation.Our findings show amongst others that the intensity of research activities increases consistently, the collaboration between industry and academia is high and the most cited publications are experience reports from practitioners.

AB  - Industry is continuously moving towards the employment and exploitation of semantic technologies due to diverse enterprise needs, such as cross-domain interoperability, system modeling, categorization of information, model validation and data reasoning. Therefore, the research community presents new semantic-based approaches for implementing industrial systems that are more flexible, self-descriptive, dynamic and interoperable with other systems that are already deployed in the field. For example, the World Wide Web Consortium standards may be employed for linking remote resources. Currently, researchers claim that there is already a great success on implementing cyber-physical systems and efficient machine-to-machine and machine-to-human interactions through semantics. However, presented solutions are not always validated in terms of security. This article suggests two techniques: threat modeling and risk assessment for protecting solutions from attacks and malicious access. In addition, these techniques permit reconsidering the architecture of common semantic-based solutions by finding requirements not predicted during design phase. Moreover, this research illustrates the application of aforementioned techniques within a case of study. The study case is focused on a semantic-based solution which handles manufacturing processes through cyber-physical systems.

T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE COMPUTER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The UrbanSim project provides a case study in Digital Government, and this article examines progress to date in developing and applying the system in a range of metropolitan areas. Digital Government is meant here in the context of an innovative, cross-cutting initiative of the National Science Foundation. The project integrates academic research on urban simulation modeling and policy evaluation with research on human-computer interaction and software engineering, and uses a value-sensitive design to ensure that the system addresses the needs of governments and citizens. This article addresses the importance of the problem domain and the project objectives, presents a range of challenges, and outlines the design and application of UrbanSim in response to these. It discusses issues arising in the application of the model in the Salt Lake City metropolitan region, where a lawsuit over a highway project has precipitated use of UrbanSim to assess the interactions of transportation, land use, and environmental outcomes, and concludes with an assessment and directions for future research.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - One key objective of Cyber-Physical System (CPS) simulation is to evaluate different CPS configurations regarding a certain user objective. First, simulation of CPS necessitates frameworks to handle heterogeneity of CPS components (the software and hardware system control, the behavior of the CPS itself and its physical environment). Then, to build simulators, designers use paradigms like FMI (Functional Mock-Up Interface) that proposes a data-driven generic interface facilitating the integration of heterogeneous models. However, in order to facilitate simulation configuration, an approach is required to drive modeling of parametric features and operational conditions. In this paper, we present CARES, a component-based and model-driven approach to facilitate CPS simulation. CARES is applied to evaluate an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) navigation function by simulation. The proposed models integrate both the principles of a generic simulation (integration of Component Based Software Engineering CBSE concepts and FMI paradigm) and domain specific aspects through a component-based architecture style. From a design model, a code generator builds the structural (Java or C++) code of the simulator. The generated code relies on a given run-time library for its execution and its structure facilitates integration of domain-specific code. The experiments show the effectiveness of the approach to build simulators for evaluation of different AUV configurations.

TI  - System Modeling and Simulation of TianWen-2 Sampling on an Asteroid Regolith Surface
T2  - SPACE-SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As China's first asteroid exploration mission, the TianWen-2 spacecraft mainly focuses on surface sampling on the near-Earth asteroid 2016 HO3. Different from the usual sampling strategy of releasing a small lander or ejecting a projectile, the whole TianWen-2 spacecraft will be controlled to achieve touchdown and sampling. However, sampling on a low-gravity regolith-covered surface with unknown physical properties is particularly challenging and risky. In order to successfully implement an in situ exploration, a comprehensive understanding and evaluation of spacecraft dynamics and control behavior during sampling is essential for system design. In this paper, a system-level simulation method for the interaction between the spacecraft and the regolith surface is proposed. The discrete element method is adopted for the simulation of granular material dynamics. Parametric comparisons with test data from microgravity low-speed intrusion drop-tower experiments are implemented to calibrate and verify the physical parameters of the discrete element method simulation model. An explicit multibody dynamics model of the spacecraft is developed to describe dynamic characteristics such as orbit and attitude motion, solar array vibration, and sampler deformation. Finally, numerical simulations of the interaction between granular dynamics, multibody dynamics, and control are performed to study the dynamics and control behaviors of TianWen-2 sampling on an asteroid regolith surface.

TI  - Temperature-Constrained Reliability Optimization of Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems Using Machine Learning and Feedback Control
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the backbone of Industry 4.0, industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs) that are geographically dispersed, federated, cooperative, and security-critical systems become the center of interest from both industry and academia. In ICPS, there are huge amounts of devices, such as sensors and actuators, which are embedded and networked together to improve the performance of real-time monitoring and control. Reliability and temperature are two important concerns of these embedded and networked devices in ICPS due to their stringent requirement of reliable execution and long lifespan. In this article, we study the problem of maximizing soft-error reliability of CPU- and GPU-integrated embedded platforms deployed in ICPS under the temperature constraint. To speed up the estimation of soft-error rate (SER) and temperature, we train an artificial neural network (ANN) that is able to quickly and accurately derive the system's SER and temperature. To solve the temperature-constrained reliability optimization problem, we propose a feedback control-based task scheduling scheme that adaptively determines the number of tasks admitted in the system and the number of replicas for the admitted tasks. We perform a series of simulation experiments to verify the efficacy of our scheme. The experimental results demonstrate that: 1) the estimated SER and temperature derived by our ANN-based method are very close to the ground-truth data and 2) our proposed feedback control-based task scheduling method can improve system reliability by up to 184.2% with a lower peak temperature when compared with one baseline and two state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Performance prediction of cloud applications through benchmarking and simulation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the cloud paradigm gains widespread adoption, the performance evaluation and prediction of cloud applications remain daunting tasks, not yet fully accomplished. Nevertheless, reliable performance figures are the key to take the cloud to the next step, in which it will be possible to predict the maintenance cost of the applications and to introduce richer service level agreements between service providers and consumer. In this paper, we propose a methodology based on benchmarking and simulation that aims at predicting the performance of cloud applications developed through the mOSAIC framework. We prove the efficacy of the methodology on a real case study, showing how it is possible to predict performance indexes (throughput, message queue length,...) under a generic workload, using pre-acquired benchmark results and simple simulation models.

TI  - A Discrete-Events Simulation Approach for Evaluation of Service-Based Applications
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE SIXTH IEEE EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON WEB SERVICES
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th IEEE European Conference on Web Services
CL  - Dublin, IRELAND
AB  - One of the promises of the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is to build complex added-value services in order to enhance and extend existing ones. Service-Based Applications (SBAs) are asked not only to perform required functionalities, but also to deliver expected level of Quality of Service (QoS). Dealing with QoS management of such distributed applications, which are executed in dynamic environments, raises the need to consider context characteristics. This paper proposes a discrete-events simulation approach which assures the evaluation of SBAs performance under different context status. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) the discrete-events modeling approach for SBAs, (ii) the context-based model for SBAs considered in the discrete-events simulation model, and (iii) the evaluation of a set of QoS metrics by simulation.

AB  - Failures in cyber-physical systems, such as trains and cars, are caused either by faults or attacks. The former are addressed by safety engineering, the latter by security analysis. Both disciplines use separate terminology, processes, and tools. However, both rely on a common system architecture and use models such as component fault trees and attack trees, respectively, for their analyses. We posit that the two disciplines should be aligned without entangling their processes or teams, mutually supporting their considerations. For that purpose, assuming a joint system model, we introduce tool support that heuristically suggests correspondences between analysis elements of the two disciplines and, upon user confirmation, derives additional suggestions for analysis. Our tool allows both disciplines to benefit from the analyses of the other, increasing consistency, exhaustiveness, and alignment of the disciplines. Our paper introduces the approach, describes our prototypical tool, and illustrates the concept with a realistic automotive use case.

AB  - Automotive electronic control units (ECUs) have been the focus of many security researchers who have demonstrated the ability to affect the deterministic operation of safety critical vehicle cyber-physical systems. Flaws in software design that have direct impacts to the functional safety of a target vehicle have been discovered. The rapid increase in data connectivity within a modern automobile has broadened the attack surface, allowing adversaries remote access to in-vehicle networks and control system software. This abstract discusses the results of static code analysis performed on automotive production software source code using reference coding standards such as MISRA and CERT C secure coding guidelines, in an attempt to identify the most critical software bugs which are likely to remain in the vehicle, undetected, as zero-day security vulnerabilities.

AB  - The reliability requirements for space-critical system call for specific tools and models. Space systems have been a long time user of models (synchronous or asynchronous building blocks), from which code generators could derive analyzable code, while also providing additional benefits like simulation, model checking, etc. However the integration of multiple models to form one complete system was done manually, in an ad hoc and time consuming way. In this paper we show how a MDE process built around ASN.1, SDL, SCADE and AADL allows for more rigor by separating concerns to defining data models, functional blocks, interfaces and then behavior of a complete system; and then weave them to build the final systems. By automating the full process, we show the benefits from the system designer perspective: reduced implied complexity, quicker access to evaluation prototype of the end system.

AB  - Agent-technologies have been used for higher-level decision making in addition to carrying out lower-level automation and control functions in industrial systems. Recent research has identified a number of architectural patterns for the use of agents in industrial automation systems but these practices vary in several ways, including how closely agents are coupled with physical systems and their control functions. Such practices may play a pivotal role in the Cyber-Physical System integration and interaction. Hence, there is a clear need for a common set of criteria for assessing available practices and identifying a best-fit practice for a given industrial use case. Unfortunately, no such common criteria exist currently. This work proposes an assessment criteria approach as well as a methodology to enable the use case based selection of a best practice for integrating agents and industrial systems. The software product quality model proposed by the ISO/IEC 25010 family of standards is used as starting point and is put in the industrial automation context. Subsequently, the proposed methodology is applied, and a survey of experts in the domain is carried out, in order to reveal some insights on the key characteristics of the subject matter.

M3  - Article
AB  - Safety regulation of safety-critical agent-based cyber-physical systems (CPS) which are manufactured in large scale such as next-gen aircrafts, autonomous driving vehicles, and medical devices is a multifaceted problem. CPS deployments can be presented with new safety-critical scenarios and novel inputs. Hence, operational characteristics of the CPS can be quite different from its safety approved design. This article considers a safety assurance solution where operational data from the sensors and actuators in the field of deployment is fed back to the manufacturing process through the Internet of Things infrastructure to assure and improve operational safety. It considers two cases: 1) model-aware, where the safety assured CPS design is fully specified; 2) model-agnostic, where limited specifications exist. For both the cases, it presents a data science based approach, N-HyMn, that learns a hybrid automaton model of the operational characteristics of the CPS from the inputioutput (I/O) traces of the observable parameters. For the model-aware case, it investigates the presence of inconsistencies between the learned model and the specifications model provided by the manufacturer, thus facilitating the detection of safety problems that may have been overlooked. For the model-agnostic case, it can detect potential safety failures. We show the usage of N-HyMn on the Medtronic Minimed 670 G system. N-HyMn correctly infers the hybrid automaton specifications of the Minimed 670 G and was able to detect a self-adaptation mechanism that is not declared explicitly in the certification documents of the U Food and Drug Administration. N-HyMn has a computational complexity of O(kn(2)), where k is the number of samples in the I/O trace, and n is the number of continuous variables.

CL  - LIMERICK, IRELAND
AB  - Current software process models (CMM, SPICE, etc.) strongly recommend the application of statistical control and measure guides to de ne, implement, and evaluate the effects of different process improvements. However, whilst quantitative modeling has been widely used in other fields, it has not been considered enough in the field of software process improvement. During the last decade software process simulation has been used to address a wide diversity of management problems. Some of these problems are related to strategic management, technology adoption, understanding, training and learning, and risk management, among others. In this work a dynamic integrated framework for software process improvement is presented. This framework combines traditional estimation models with an intensive utilization of dynamic simulation models of the software process. The aim of this framework is to support a qualitative and quantitative assessment for software process improvement and decision making to achieve a higher software development process capability according to the Capability Maturity Model. The concepts underlying this framework have been implemented in a software process improvement tool that has been used in a local software organization. The results obtained and the lessons learned are also presented in this paper.

AB  - This paper presents an industry-unique approach and improved model-based engineering practices for software-reliant aircraft systems aligned with the Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE (TM)) open system technical reference architecture.A lifecycle toolset is described which fuses systems and software modeling and simulation (M&S) capabilities, modular open system architectures (MOSA), and device and sensor integration techniques into a single package to enable rapid design, development, verification, certification, and deployment of interoperable, platform portable, embedded mission-critical safety-critical avionic systems.TES' MBSE lifecycle toolset, AWESUM (TM), supports system architecture and virtual integration (SAVI) of cyber-physical system (CPS) assets, and evaluation of these platform assets through simulated mission rehearsals in a network-centric collaborative virtual environment. The result is improved systems product.The toolset has been demonstrated to several aviation-focused communities including the American Helicopter Society International (AHS), the Association of Old Crows (AOC), the FACE Consortium, and the US Army's Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC), with favorable response.TES demonstrated a virtual simulation of realistically modeled and simulated multiple dissimilar aircraft platform systems conducting network centric operations (NCO). With the goal of improving flight-safety and enhancing the situational awareness (SA) of the battlespace, virtual missions were executed showing the interoperations of cyber-physical system (CPS) assets and capabilities from reusable FACE-aligned applications. The simulated battlespace was composed of device-configured simulated flight models of both manned and unmanned rotorcraft platforms operating within a virtual environment of real-world terrain data. The environment included simulated threats and obstacles used to stimulate platform devices that report detections and produce alerts for own-ship flight mishap avoidance. These detections were then packaged into communications messages (VMF) and shared off-platform via NCO to the common operating picture (COP) to enhance the SA operations of the battlespace flight group.After a decade of development and use supporting US Army military common software programs for the PM-AME and AMRDEC, TES is now making its industry-unique approach and model-based airworthy systems/ software lifecycle product line available to industry. The MBSE lifecycle toolset product suite, referred to as AWESUM (TM) for AirWorthy Engineering Systems Unified Modeling, is a comprehensive model-based environment aligned to DO-178C, DO-331, AC 20-148, AR 70-62, and FACE (TM).The AWESUM (TM) tool suite is currently supporting the US Army's Joint Common Architecture project, a model-based avionics architecture for the Joint Multi-Role family of future vertical lift platforms, and two other FACE-aligned US Army Aviation programs within the military communications and aircraft survivability domains.This is TES-SAVi's first publication and presentation to the IEEE. While we have applied our capabilities to the Military Aviation domain, these capabilities can be effectively applied to Aerospace and other domains.

TI  - Semantically reliable multicast: Definition, implementation, and performance evaluation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic Reliability is a novel correctness criterion for multicast protocols based on the concept of message obsolescence: A message becomes obsolete when its content or purpose is superseded by a subsequent message. By exploiting obsolescence, a reliable multicast protocol may drop irrelevant messages to find additional buffer space for new messages. This makes the multicast protocol more resilient to transient performance perturbations of group members, thus improving throughput stability. This paper describes our experience in developing a suite of semantically reliable protocols. It summarizes the motivation, definition, and algorithmic issues and presents performance figures obtained with a running implementation. The data obtained experimentally is compared with analytic and simulation models. This comparison allows us to confirm the validity of these models and the usefulness of the approach. Finally, the paper reports the application of our prototype to distributed multiplayer games.

TI  - A Cloud-to-Edge Approach to Support Predictive Analytics in Robotics Industry
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Data management and processing to enable predictive analytics in cyber physical systems holds the promise of creating insight over underlying processes, discovering anomalous behaviours and predicting imminent failures threatening a normal and smooth production process. In this context, proactive strategies can be adopted, as enabled by predictive analytics. Predictive analytics in turn can make a shift in traditional maintenance approaches to more effective optimising their cost and transforming maintenance from a necessary evil to a strategic business factor. Empowered by the aforementioned points, this paper discusses a novel methodology for remaining useful life (RUL) estimation enabling predictive maintenance of industrial equipment using partial knowledge over its degradation function and the parameters that are affecting it. Moreover, the design and prototype implementation of a plug-n-play end-to-end cloud architecture, supporting predictive maintenance of industrial equipment is presented integrating the aforementioned concept as a service. This is achieved by integrating edge gateways, data stores at both the edge and the cloud, and various applications, such as predictive analytics, visualization and scheduling, integrated as services in the cloud system. The proposed approach has been implemented into a prototype and tested in an industrial use case related to the maintenance of a robotic arm. Obtained results show the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed methodology in supporting predictive analytics in the era of Industry 4.0.

AB  - The network service providers require cost-effective multi-service platforms that can meet their customer's diverse, dynamic, and demanding application requirements. Multi-service platforms require flexible, configurable, versatile, scalable, and multi-purpose VLSI solutions. The emerging ASIC solutions, for these applications, are appropriately termed Network Processors (NPs) or "systems on a chip." Many of the emerging NPs are limited to only processing cell/packet-based traffic with functionalities distributed over several chip components, Onex's intelligent TDM, ATM, Packet (iTAP(TM)) system can support TDM-based and cell/packet-based traffic on only two chip components. In this article, we provide a short background on the network processors followed by an overview of iTAP(TM)'s system architecture. The iTAP(TM)'s distributed dynamic bandwidth allocation mechanism will be described. A simulation model of some of the algorithms implemented in the iTAP(TM) is also provided. Finally, we will state the concluding remarks and elaborate on the issues that require further investigation.

CL  - Nantes, FRANCE
AB  - Cyber-physical systems often encompass complex concurrent behavior with timing constraints and probabilistic failures on demand. The analysis whether such systems with probabilistic timed behavior adhere to a given specification is essential. When the states of the system can be represented by graphs, the rule-based formalism of Probabilistic Timed Graph Transformation System (PTGTSs) can be used to suitably capture structure dynamics as well as probabilistic and timed behavior of the system. The model checking support for PTGTSs w.r.t. properties specified using Probabilistic Timed Computation Tree Logic (PTCTL) has been already presented. Moreover, for timed graph-based runtime monitoring, Metric Temporal Graph Logic (MTGL) has been developed for stating metric temporal properties on identified subgraphs and their structural changes over time.In this paper, we (a) extend MTGL to the Probabilistic Metric Temporal Graph Logic (PMTGL) by allowing for the specification of probabilistic properties, (b) adapt our MTGL satisfaction checking approach to PTGTSs, and (c) combine the approaches for PTCTL model checking and MTGL satisfaction checking to obtain a Bounded Model Checking (BMC) approach for PMTGL. In our evaluation, we apply an implementation of our BMC approach in AUTOGRAPH to a running example.

TI  - Critical Infrastructure and Cyber Systems: Introduction to a Minitrack for Evolving Future Cyber Solutions

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 57th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)
CL  - Honolulu, HI
AB  - There is tremendous pressure to build and operate cyber systems ever-faster and at increasing scales to meet the demands of growing populations. Meanwhile, cyber physical systems live in a multi-functionary area of practice, so secure and resilient methods of scaling are difficult because of the diverse dependencies, range of unique expertise required, and the involvement of fallible humans. To fundamentally improve the state of cybersecurity, we remain convinced that research must consider cross-disciplinary techniques and investigate novel paths. Incremental progress is unlikely to substantially improve the state of the practice.This minitrack seeks to challenge the status quo and quantitatively investigate novel approaches to securing cyber systems, doing so in a scientifically-rigorous manner that includes well-founded problem definition, thoughtful experimental design, and thorough analysis of results. Viable approaches include defense-in-depth through novel security automation leveraging open source tools, increasing cyber system resilience in a quantifiable way, and expanding blue and red team procedures and tool innovations. One of this year's papers proposes an innovative blue team technique to visualize and assess cyber system architecture and security; the second paper provides a foundation for working towards a more effective user experience realted to cyber training. Both papers are inspiring first steps towards addressing cyber system insecurity.

TI  - Simulating Software Support Delays in a 24/7 Environment Using Discrete Event Simulation
T2  - 2022 IEEE INTERNATIONAL IOT, ELECTRONICS AND MECHATRONICS CONFERENCE (IEMTRONICS)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International IOT, Electronics and Mechatronics Conference (IEMTRONICS)
CL  - Toronto, CANADA
AB  - Since there is a cost associated with providing 24/7 support, it is also common to divide user support into tiers where a group focused on usability and training of the software provides tier 1 support and another group, consisting of mainly developers, is focused on feature development, software bug fixing, and related issues work separately in a different tier. This paper focuses on software organizations where the developer tier operates from just one part of the world under a single time zone. This group is not available on a 24/7 basis, but the Tier 1 group works in different regions - and hence time zones - throughout the world to deal with user problems and questions. Users can be internal or external, depending on the purpose of the software. This paper discusses only internal users (developers, users and help desk employees who work for the same company) and the delays in support when dealing with these users who may be working in different regions and/or time zones. Tier 1 support is available around the clock due to hiring help desk resources in different locations under different time zones. If an issue cannot be resolved, the Tier 1 workers escalate the issue to the next tier (the developers), who work regular hours in one region under one time zone. This paper uses discrete event simulation modelling to provide insights for a company with a similar structure to better understand possible software support delays. These delays can be reduced, and better overall support can be provided in the future.

TI  - Analysis of large ATM switches using a platform-independent simulation environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a general simulation approach applied to the problem of performance evaluation of large switching fabrics. Experimental results in the form of cell queuing delay and buffer occupancy distributions for switches with up to 2048 inputs and outputs operating under a wide variety of loads are presented. The traditional dilemma between simulation model validity and its run-time where a more general purpose model inevitably results in longer execution rimes, is eliminated by the introduction of a new parameter: the architecture of the simulation platform. With model validity as an invariant, the simulation platform can range from a sequential computer via shared memory and distributed memory general purpose parallel processors up to a dedicated emulator, on the condition that the software engineering problem has been solved, i.e. that there is a software tool available that automates that task of generating simulation code for various platforms from a single model, taking the characteristics of the platforms (granularity) into account. An analytical model of the class of applications under study gives insight into the influence of machine and problem parameters on simulator run-time performance, Examples of its use for the choice of an optimal parallel architecture for a given problem and of its use for the estimation of application behavior on a given parallel machine architecture are presented.

AB  - The least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) is a kernel method. The training problem of LS-SVMs is solved by finding a solution to a set of linear equations. This makes online adaptive implementation of the algorithm feasible. An improved adaptive algorithm is proposed for training the LS-SVMs in this paper. This algorithm is especially useful on online nonlinear system modeling. The experiments with benchmark problem have shown the validity of the proposed method even in the case of additive noise to the system.

TI  - Modelling and simulation of blood collection systems: improvement of human resources allocation for better cost-effectiveness and reduction of candidate donor abandonment
T2  - VOX SANGUINIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background This study addresses the modelling and simulation of blood collection for fixed blood collection sites in a medium-sized large French city, as well as mobile blood collection in urban and rural environments. Study Design and Methods Formal Petri net models were used to describe all relevant donor flows of the various blood collection systems; the Petri net models were converted onto discrete-event simulation models, allowing the evaluation of a large number of scenarios and configurations of blood collection systems. Quantitative models were proposed that encompassed all components of the blood collection systems, such as the donor arrival process, resource capacities and performance indicators. Appropriate experimental designs and cost-effectiveness analyses were used to determine the best configurations of human resources and donor appointment strategies. Results The donor service level depended on both adequate human resources capacity and appropriate appointment strategies. These decisions depend on the distribution during the day of walk-in donors. Conclusion Models permit to improve management of blood collection; they have now partially entered the real situation, awaiting further implementation.

AB  - The Bonseyes EU H2020 collaborative project aims to develop a platform consisting of a Data Marketplace, a Deep Learning Toolbox, and Developer Reference Platforms for organizations wanting to adopt Artificial Intelligence. The project will be focused on using artificial intelligence in low power Internet of Things (IoT) devices ("edge computing"), embedded computing systems, and data center servers ("cloud computing"). It will bring about orders of magnitude improvements in efficiency, performance, reliability, security, and productivity in the design and programming of systems of artificial intelligence that incorporate Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). In addition, it will solve a causality problem for organizations who lack access to Data and Models. Its open software architecture will facilitate adoption of the whole concept on a wider scale. To evaluate the effectiveness, technical feasibility, and to quantify the real-world improvements in efficiency, security, performance, effort and cost of adding AI to products and services using the Bonseyes platform, four complementary demonstrators will be built. Bonseyes platform capabilities are aimed at being aligned with the European FI-PPP activities and take advantage of its flagship project FIWARE. This paper provides a description of the project motivation, goals and preliminary work.

AB  - Using process simulation and AI search methods, we compare software reuse against other possible changes to a project. such as reducing functionality or improving the skills of the programmer population. In one case, two generations of reuse were as good or better than any other project change (but a third and fourth generation of reuse was not useful). In another case, applying reuse to a project was demonstrable worse than several other possible changes to a project.Our conclusion is that the general claims regarding the benefits of software reuse do not hold for specific projects. We argue that the merits of software reuse need to be evaluated in a project by project basis. AI search over process models is useful for such an assessment, particularly when there is not sufficient data for precisely tuning a simulation model.

AB  - There is a constant challenge in process industry to reduce costs because of tight competition on the global market. On the other hand the advancement in the new technologies such as Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA), Industrial Ethernet, 5G, and cloud computing provide the possibility to implement cost effective Cyber-physical systems (CPS). This allows flexible, reconfigurable, scalable, interoperable business models. These trends in the process industry should be taken into account while teaching future engineers. In this article the modern process automation setup which includes three miniplants with optional 5G connectivity is described along with teaching approach for executing the students projects. Using this infrastructure students obtain knowledge with emerging industrial technology and become the actors of upcoming industrial revolution.

TI  - Mutation Analysis for Cyber-Physical Systems: Scalable Solutions and Results in the Space Domain
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - On-board embedded software developed for spaceflight systems (space software) must adhere to stringent software quality assurance procedures. For example, verification and validation activities are typically performed and assessed by third party organizations. To further minimize the risk of human mistakes, space agencies, such as the European Space Agency (ESA), are looking for automated solutions for the assessment of software testing activities, which play a crucial role in this context. Though space software is our focus here, it should be noted that such software shares the above considerations, to a large extent, with embedded software in many other types of cyber-physical systems. Over the years, mutation analysis has shown to be a promising solution for the automated assessment of test suites; it consists of measuring the quality of a test suite in terms of the percentage of injected faults leading to a test failure. A number of optimization techniques, addressing scalability and accuracy problems, have been proposed to facilitate the industrial adoption of mutation analysis. However, to date, two major problems prevent space agencies from enforcing mutation analysis in space software development. First, there is uncertainty regarding the feasibility of applying mutation analysis optimization techniques in their context. Second, most of the existing techniques either can break the real-time requirements common in embedded software or cannot be applied when the software is tested in Software Validation Facilities, including CPU emulators and sensor simulators. In this paper, we enhance mutation analysis optimization techniques to enable their applicability to embedded software and propose a pipeline that successfully integrates them to address scalability and accuracy issues in this context, as described above. Further, we report on the largest study involving embedded software systems in the mutation analysis literature. Our research is part of a research project funded by ESA ESTEC involving private companies (GomSpace Luxembourg and LuxSpace) in the space sector. These industry partners provided the case studies reported in this paper; they include an on-board software system managing a microsatellite currently on-orbit, a set of libraries used in deployed cubesats, and a mathematical library certified by ESA.

AB  - Uncertainty in safety-critical cyber-physical systems can be modeled using a finite number of parameters or input signals. Given a system specification in Signal Temporal Logic (STL), we would like to verify that for all (infinite) values of the model parameters/input signals, the system satisfies its specification. Unfortunately, this problem is undecidable in general. Statistical model checking (SMC) offers a solution by providing guarantees on the correctness of CPS models by statistically reasoning on model simulations. We propose a new approach for statistical verification of CPS models for userprovided distribution on the model parameters. Our technique uses model simulations to learn surrogate models, and uses conformal inference to provide probabilistic guarantees on the satisfaction of a given STL property. Additionally, we can provide prediction intervals containing the quantitative satisfaction values of the given STL property for any user-specified confidence level. We also propose a refinement procedure based on Gaussian Process (GP)-based surrogate models for obtaining fine-grained probabilistic guarantees over sub-regions in the parameter space. This in turn enables the CPS designer to choose assured validity domains in the parameter space for safety-critical applications. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique on several CPS models.

TI  - Towards scalable and reusable predictive models for cyber twins in manufacturing systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING
M3  - Article
AB  - Smart factories are intelligent, fully-connected and flexible systems that can continuously monitor and analyse data streams from interconnected systems to make decisions and dynamically adapt to new circumstances. The implementation of smart factories represents a leap forward compared to traditional automation. It is underpinned by the deployment of cyberphysical systems that, through the application of Artificial Intelligence, integrate predictive capabilities and foster rapid decision-making. Deep Learning (DL) is a key enabler for the development of smart factories. However, the implementation of DL in smart factories is hindered by its reliance on large amounts of data and extreme computational demand. To address this challenge, Transfer Learning (TL) has been proposed to promote the efficient training of models by enabling the reuse of previously trained models. In this paper, by means of a specific example in aluminium can manufacturing, an empirical study is presented, which demonstrates the potential of TL to achieve fast deployment of scalable and reusable predictive models for Cyber Manufacturing Systems. Through extensive experiments, the value of TL is demonstrated to achieve better generalisation and model performance, especially with limited datasets. This research provides a pragmatic approach towards predictive model building for cyber twins, paving the way towards the realisation of smart factories.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 16th IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA)
CL  - Macau, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - This paper presents RapidRT, a novel statistical approach to Worst-Case Response-Time (WCRT) analysis targeting complex embedded real-time systems. The proposed algorithm combines Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and other statistical methods in order to produce a probabilistic WCRT estimate. This estimate is calculated using response time data from either Monte Carlo simulations of a detailed model of the system, or from response-time measurements of the real system. The method could be considered as a pragmatic approach intended for complex industrial systems with real-time requirements. The target systems contain tasks with many intricate dependencies in their temporal behavior, which violates the assumptions of traditional analytical methods for response time analysis and thereby makes them overly pessimistic. An evaluation is presented using two simulation models, inspired by an industrial robotic control system, and five other methods as reference.

TI  - Distributed graph queries over models@run.time for runtime monitoring of cyber-physical systems
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON SOFTWARE TOOLS FOR TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Smart cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have complex interaction with their environment which is rarely known in advance, and they heavily depend on intelligent data processing carried out over a heterogeneous and distributed computation platform with resource-constrained devices to monitor, manage and control autonomous behavior. First, we propose a distributed runtime model to capture the operational state and the context information of a smart CPS using directed, typed and attributed graphs as high-level knowledge representation. The runtime model is distributed among the participating nodes, and it is consistently kept up to date in a continuously evolving environment by a time-triggered model management protocol. Our runtime models offer a (domain-specific) model query and manipulation interface over the reliable communication middleware of the Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard widely used in the CPS domain. Then, we propose to carry out distributed runtime monitoring by capturing critical properties of interest in the form of graph queries, and design a distributed graph query evaluation algorithm for evaluating such graph queries over the distributed runtime model. As the key innovation, our (1) distributed runtime model extends existing publish-subscribe middleware (like DDS) used in real-time CPS applications by enabling the dynamic creation and deletion of graph nodes (without compile time limits). Moreover, (2) our distributed query evaluation extends existing graph query techniques by enabling query evaluation in a real-time, resource-constrained environment while still providing scalable performance. Our approach is illustrated, and an initial scalability evaluation is carried out on the MoDeS3 CPS demonstrator and the open Train Benchmark for graph queries.

AB  - Robotic technology helps humans in different areas such as manufacturing, health care and education. Due to the ubiquitous revolution, today's focus is on mobile robots and their applications in a variety of cyber-physical systems. ROS is a wll-known and powerful middleware that facilitates software development for mobile robots. However, this middleware does not support assuring properties such as timeliness and safety of ROS-based software. In this paper we present an integration of Timed Rebeca modeling language with ROS to synthesize verified robotic software. First, a conceptual model of robotic programs is developed using Timed Rebeca. After verifying a set of user-defined correctness properties on this model, it is translated to a ROS program automatically. Experiments on some small-scale case studies illustrates the applicability of the proposed integration method. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Safety assurance in critical IoT systems is increasingly important as those systems are becoming ubiquitous in various application areas, such as health care and transportation. Recently, novel runtime monitoring approaches started to adapt expressive rule- or query-based languages to capture safety properties, which are evaluated over runtime models. In this paper, we define two distributed query-based runtime monitoring strategies for IoT and cyber-physical systems built on top of a distributed runtime model deployed over the Data Distribution Service as standard communication middleware. We provide detailed scalability evaluation of our prototype implementation over a case study motivated by an open-source IoT demonstrator.

AB  - For simulation practitioners, the common steps in a simulation modeling engagement are likely familiar: problem assessment, requirements specification, model building, verification, validation, and delivery of results. And for industrial engineers, it's a well-known adage that paying careful attention to process can help achieve better results. In this paper, we'll apply this philosophy to the process of model building as well. We'll consider model building within the framework of a software development exercise, and discuss how best practices from the broader software community can be applied for process improvement. In particular, we'll focus on the "Milestones Approach" to simulation development - based on the popular "agile software" philosophy and our own experiences in real-world simulation consulting practice. We'll discuss how thinking agile can help minimize risk within the model-building process, and help create a better simulation for your customers.

AB  - Binary analysis of closed-source, low-level, and embedded systems software has emerged at the heart of cyber-physical vulnerability assessment of third-party or legacy devices in safety-critical systems. In particular, recovering the semantics of the source algorithmic implementations enables analysts to understand the context of a particular binary program snippet. However, experimentation and evaluation of binary analysis techniques on real-world embedded cyber-physical systems are limited to domain-specific testbeds with a low number of use cases-insufficient to support emerging data-driven techniques. Moreover, the use cases rarely have the source mathematical expressions, algorithms, and compiled binaries. In this paper, we present AUTOCPS, a framework for generating a large corpus of control systems binaries along with their source algorithmic expressions and source code. AUTOCPS enables researchers to tune the control system binary data generation by varying different permutations of cyber-physical modules, e.g., the underlying control algorithm, while ensuring a semantically valid binary. We initially constrain AUTOCPS to the flight software domain and generate over 4000 semantically different control systems source representations, which are then used to generate hundreds of thousands of binaries. We describe current and future use cases of AUTOCPS towards cyber-physical vulnerability assessment of safety-critical systems.

AB  - Self-adaptivity is mainly used to address uncertainties, unpredicted events, as well as to automate administration tasks. It allows systems to change themselves while executing in order to address expected or unexpected changes and to adapt as much as possible to the current execution context. Self-adaptivity is particularly meaningful for dynamic application domains such as Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), service oriented based solutions (SOA), cloud computing, robotics, among many others. There are various available solutions in these domains that exploit self-adaptivity. The question is how can we analyze them to understand how self-adaptivity is implemented and exploited in order to use and re-use, as well as to adapt existing solutions to new or other systems? In this paper, we propose a first step in this direction, by analyzing available self-adaptive systems (and especially their self-adaptive mechanisms) in various application domains using the Understand tool - widely used for software development, analysis, and quality assessment.

TI  - Modeling and Analyzing the Inventory Level for Demand Uncertainty in the VUCA World: Evidence From Biomedical Manufacturer
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As the world is witnessing unprecedented events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, we live in a volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguity (VUCA) world. Where volatility in supplies, Uncertainty in demand, Complexity in getting the products, and Ambiguity in understanding the issues. Such a scenario constitutes a VUCA world, and inventory positioning is no exception. Inventory positioning manages the safety stock across echelons to maintain customer service levels undersupply or demand uncertainties. Therefore, this article focuses on optimizing the inventory levels in demand uncertainty and supply complexity through inventory positioning and making reliable forecasts using machine learning for biomedical equipment, especially knee implants. The product flow is mapped through a discrete event simulation model by considering a biechelon supply chain. The parameters like reorder point, order quantity, supply lead time, and inventory costs are considered, and Arena modelled and simulated inventory replenishment. They are optimized with in-built OptQuest to minimize back orders and total costs. The model determines the safety stock inventories positioned at both echelons to achieve service level constraints. The uncertainty in demand is the root cause of the abovementioned issues and may be reduced through more reliable forecasts.

AB  - Reliability of a system is a measure of the likelihood that the system will perform as expected for a predefined time period. Fault tree analysis, as a popular method for analyzing reliability of systems, has gained a widespread use in many areas, such as the automotive and aviation industry. Fault trees of systems are usually designed by domain experts, based on their knowledge. Since systems change their behaviors during their lifetimes, knowledge-driven fault trees might not accurately reflect true behaviors of systems. Thus, deriving fault trees from data would be a better alternative, especially for non-safety-critical systems, where the amounts of data on faults can be significant. We present an approach and a tool for Data-Driven Fault Tree Analysis (DDFTA) that extract fault trees from time series data of a system, and uses simulation to analyze the extracted fault trees to estimate reliability measures of systems.

AB  - We develop a three-phase design scheme for fuzzy modeling using input-output training data. The first step is to establish an approximate rule base using a clustering method, then the selective rule activation technique is applied to resize the rule base, and finally the parameters are fine-tuned by the backpropagation algorithm. Simulation results show that this scheme generates a good fuzzy model that can successfully predict the system output and the rules selected by the selective rule activation technique are appropriate for generalizing different sets of data.

TI  - An efficient memory management algorithm for client-server database management systems
T2  - COMPUTER JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the recent improvements in the price/performance characteristics of workstations and the networking capabilities, the client-server system architecture has become a target for database systems. A client-server database management system (DBMS) provides the management of a database that resides on a client-server system. Data-access requests of the clients are handled by the database servers. The whole database is stored on the disks that can be accessed by only the servers, and in order to reduce disk accesses, copies of database items can be cached in the global memory which comprises the memories of all the computers connected to the system. Designing efficient global memory management algorithms helps the transactions experience less disk input/output (I/O) during their execution. In this paper, we propose a global memory management algorithm for client-server DBMSs which aims to reduce disk I/O by increasing the portion of the database available in global memory. Performance of the algorithm is examined by a comparison with some previously proposed algorithms, using a simulation model designed for studying various performance issues in client-server DBMSs. Conditions for which the new algorithm provides significant improvements in the overall throughput of the system are identified.

TI  - Rehosting a mini-computer model on a supercomputer
T2  - SIMULATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Many ecosystem simulation computer codes have been developed in the last twenty-five years. This development took place initially on main-frame computers, then mini-computers, and more recently, on micro-computers and workstations. Supercomputing platforms (both parallel and distributed systems) have been largely unused, however, because of the perceived difficulty in accessing and using the machines. Also, significant differences in the system architectures of sequential, scalar computers and parallel and/or vector supercomputers must be considered. We have transferred a grassland simulation model (developed on a VAX) to a Cray Y-MP C90. We describe porting the model to the Cray and the changes we made to exploit the parallelism in the application and improve code execution. The Cray executed the model 30 times faster than the VAX and 10 times faster than a Unix workstation. We achieved an additional speedup of 30 percent by using the compiler's vectorizing and ''in-line'' capabilities. The code runs at only about 5 percent of the Cray's peak speed because it ineffectively uses the vector and parallel processing capabilities of the Cray. We expect that by restructuring the code, it could execute and additional six to ten times faster. Our goal was not just to increase the speed of code execution, but to enable the restructured and ported code to access and manipulate large data matrices holding intermediate and state variables, to increase the size of the geographical areas that can be simulated, and to be able to use large remote sensing data sets to drive the model or use as validation.

TI  - MARMOT: Metamorphic Runtime Monitoring of Autonomous Driving Systems
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Autonomous driving systems (ADSs) are complex cyber-physical systems (CPSs) that must ensure safety even in uncertain conditions. Modern ADSs often employ deep neural networks (DNNs), which may not produce correct results in every possible driving scenario. Thus, an approach to estimate the confidence of an ADS at runtime is necessary to prevent potentially dangerous situations. In this article we propose MARMOT, an online monitoring approach for ADSs based on metamorphic relations (MRs), which are properties of a system that hold among multiple inputs and the corresponding outputs. Using domain-specific MRs, MARMOT estimates the uncertainty of the ADS at runtime, allowing the identification of anomalous situations that are likely to cause a faulty behavior of the ADS, such as driving off the road. We perform an empirical assessment of MARMOT with five different MRs, using two different subject ADSs, including a small-scale physical ADS and a simulated ADS. Our evaluation encompasses the identification of both external anomalies, e.g., fog, as well as internal anomalies, e.g., faulty DNNs due to mislabeled training data. Our results show that MARMOT can identify up to 65% of the external anomalies and 100% of the internal anomalies in the physical ADS, and up to 54% of the external anomalies and 88% of the internal anomalies in the simulated ADS. With these results, MARMOT outperforms or is comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches, including SelfOracle, Ensemble, and MC Dropout-based ADS monitors.

AB  - Simulation in education is a replacement model for real world experience. This approach is seen effective to give undergraduate students the opportunity to apply their theoretical knowledge and practice their skills learnt in laboratory. Simulation education is designed to emphasize outcome based education or known as OBE to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Implementing simulation model to represent real world practice in industry, undergraduate students are trained to deal with real problems in the right atmosphere. The effort eventually prepares the students to face a real working environment when they are graduated from the university. This paper discusses the curriculum designed for simulation education applied for undergraduate students in university, its implementation and the analysis of the outcome product. A specific case of Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka is presented here.

CP  - 11th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE 2000)

AB  - Risk assessment is an essential process of every software risk management plan. Sever al risk assessment techniques are bused on the subjective judgement of domain experts. Subjective risk assessment techniques are human intensive and error-prone. Risk assessment should be based on product attributes that we can quantitatively measure using product metrics.This paper presents a methodology for risk assessment at the Early stages of the development lifecycle, namely the architecture level. We describe a heuristic risk assessment methodology that is based on dynamic metrics obtained from UML specifications. The methodology uses dynamic complexity and dynamic coupling metrics to define complexity factors for the architecture elements (components and connectors). Severity analysis is performed using Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) as applied to the architecture simulation models. We combine severity and complexity factors to develop heuristic risk factors Sol the architecture components and connectors. Based on component dependency graphs -that were developed earlier for reliability analysis- and using analysis scenarios, we develop a risk assessment model and a risk analysis algorithm that aggregates risk factors of components and connectors to the architectural level. We show how to analyze the overall risk factor of the architecture as the function of the risk factors of its constituting components and connectors. A case study of a pacemaker is used to illustrate the application of the methodology.

AB  - The intelligent industrial environment developed with the support of the new generation network cyber-physical system (CPS) can realize the high concentration of information resources. In order to carry out the analysis and quantification for the reliability of CPS, an automatic online assessment method for the reliability of CPS is proposed in this article. It builds an evaluation framework based on the knowledge of machine learning, designs an online rank algorithm, and realizes the online analysis and assessment in real time. The preventive measures can be taken timely, and the system can operate normally and continuously. Its reliability has been greatly improved. Based on the credibility of the Internet and the Internet of Things, a typical CPS control model based on the spatiotemporal correlation detection model is analyzed to determine the comprehensive reliability model analysis strategy. Based on this, in this article, we propose a CPS trusted robust intelligent control strategy and a trusted intelligent prediction model. Through the simulation analysis, the influential factors of attack defense resources and the dynamic process of distributed cooperative control are obtained. CPS defenders in the distributed cooperative control mode can be guided and select the appropriate defense resource input according to the CPS attack and defense environment.

TI  - Schedulability analysis and stack size minimization with preemption thresholds and mixed-criticality scheduling
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mixed-Criticality Scheduling (MCS) is an effective approach to addressing certification requirements of safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems that integrate multiple subsystems with different levels of criticality in application domains such as avionics and automotive systems. Although MCS was originally proposed in the context of safety-critical avionics applications, it is also finding its way into the automotive domain which faces intense cost-cutting pressure in today's hyper-competitive market, so it is important to minimize hardware costs by adopting low-cost processors with limited processing and memory resources. Preemption Threshold Scheduling (PTS) is a well-known technique for controlling the degree of preemption in real-time scheduling, with benefits of reduced stack size and reduced number of preemptions compared to fully-preemptive scheduling. We present schedulability analysis to enable integration of PTS with MCS, including two variants PT-rtb and PT-max, in order to reduce application stack space requirement, and enable efficient implementation of MCS on resource-constrained embedded platforms. We also integrate our schedulability tests with priority and preemption threshold assignment algorithms, to have a complete solution for analysis and synthesis of mixed-criticality systems. Performance evaluation illustrates the benefits of our approach in terms of increased schedulability and reduced stack requirement. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Design for safety-critical software intended for domains like transportation or medical systems is known to be difficult but is required to give a sufficient level of assurance that the system will not harm or kill people. To add to the difficulty, systems have now become highly connected and are turning into cyber-physical systems. This results in the need to address intentional cyber security threats on top of risks related to unintentional software defects. Different approaches are being defined to co-engineer both software security and safety in a consistent way. This paper aims at providing a deeper understanding of those approaches and the evolution of related standards by analysing them using a sound goal-oriented framework that can model both kind of properties and also reason on them in a risk-oriented way. In the process interesting codesign patterns are also identified and discussed. The approach is driven by a real world open specification from the railways.

AB  - In this paper, we use a deep learning method, restricted Boltzmann machine, for nonlinear system identification. The neural model has deep architecture and is generated by a random search method. The initial weights of this deep neural model are obtained from the restricted Boltzmann machines. To identify nonlinear systems, we propose special unsupervised learning methods with input data. The normal supervised learning is used to train the weights with the output data. The modified algorithm is validated by modeling two benchmark systems.

TI  - SGER:   Open Verification Platform and Event-based Semantics
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - We now rely on computer software for everything from pacemakers and telephones to automobiles, airplanes, and spacecraft. Software is often the most expensive and least reliable component in the systems in which it is embedded. The construction and verification of software requires a range of expertise that is typically available only from a team of individuals and shared semantic models.  Current technology for software development does not support such collaborative development.This project is performing an exploratory study to design and prototype an open verification platform based on an evidential tool bus (ETB) for the integration of multiple logic-based tools. The Open Verification Platform (OVP) builds on the ETB to support the social construction of verified code for embedded software in cyber-physical systems. Such a platform would be used to synthesize the contributions of multiple sources of expertise in the verification of software, including domain experts, requirements analysts, developers, testers, and verification experts.  The OVP design initiates a much-needed dialogue between researchers in cyber-physical systems (CPS) and verification tools to explore the architectural and semantic challenges in building collaborative tools. The project is using the OVP to bootstrap such a dialogue. The vision of the OVP effort is formal software development as a collaborative endeavor between diverse viewpoints and sources of expertise. It integrates formal verification tools within a social networking model so that problems can be solved quickly with the help of the appropriate experts. The broader impact of this proposal is in the design of a continuous social process for developing trustworthy cyber-physical systems, and for the rigorous training of software development teams.As part of this effort, the project is organizing a workshop on Event-based Semantics to be held at CPSWEEK 2008, in St. Louis, Missouri. The shift towards openness, distribution of real time, embedded and critical systems, and the deep integration of software into physical systems, combined with the need for certification, results in a major verification challenge. The proposed workshop sets the stage for a new research area developing event-based models, logics, specification languages, and verification tools to support the design, development, maintenance, monitoring and evolution of cyber-physical systems and other distributed, real-time, embedded systems.  The workshop seeks to develop broad agreement on the critical issues facing the modeling and design of distributed real-time systems in order to bridge the gap between the formal models and the urgent CPS engineering challenges.

TI  - Automated modelling of residential buildings and heating systems based on smart grid monitoring data
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - More than 60% of the energy is consumed in European households for space heating. Combined with the currently low renovation rate, the realization of the 2000 W society will be challenging. A fast and remote detection of optimal retrofitting targets may help to address this problem. In this contribution, a novel procedure to characterise a building and its heating systems from smart grid monitoring data is presented. The parameters of a simplified physical simulation model for the building and heating system are adjusted to match the simulated and the actual power consumption of the heat pump. The method is validated on three reference buildings with almost perfect reproduction of the heat consumption over the course of one year and good recovery of relevant building/heating system parameters. The application on five real-world buildings shows the possibility to reproduce the annual heat consumption within a maximal deviation of 5% in four out of five cases. These convincing results enable also the application of the developed procedure as a load prediction tool. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Evaluating Designs of a Three-Lane Exit Ramp Based on the Entropy Method
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The interchange diverging area is a bottleneck section of the freeway. If the capacity of a two-lane exit cannot meet the traffic demand, it will lead to a reduction in the overall operational efficiency of the freeway. To fundamentally improve the capacity of the diverging area, designers have considered expanding the two-lane exit to a three-lane exit. However, the existing Chinese design specifications do not include a design for a three-lane exit, and the method of increasing the number of ramp lanes by setting up auxiliary lanes according to traditional design concepts leads to the mainline widening section being too long, thus increasing the construction land use and project cost. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative three-lane exit design based on a specific two-lane exit at an interchange in Xi'an. According to the different traffic organization methods, three microscopic simulation models of diverging areas were constructed by using VISSIM. The entropy method was used to objectively calculate the weights of the four selected evaluation indexes, and a comprehensive evaluation and applicability analysis of the current situation and the three-lane exit design schemes were conducted. The results show that the optimal combination of the schemes calculated by the entropy method increases the traffic volume by up to 40% and reduces delays by 50-88%.

AB  - Supply-chain management covers the planning and management of material and information flow from the manufacturer through the distributors, and finally to the customer With the globalization of markets, the effective practice of supply-chain management is crucial for improving a company's competitive advantage. Simulation can help the company to facilitate the design, evaluation and optimization of their supply-chain. To support the reusability of existing simulation models in a supply-chain simulation, a common standard is required for enabling interoperability amongst different simulation programs through a well-defined interface. High Level Architecture (HLA) is an architecture for reuse and interoperation of simulation components. This paper reports our experiences on employing HLA to support reusability and interoperability by adapting a semi-conductor supply-chain simulation for the HLA. Our experiments show that by fine-tuning the integration of the application with the HLA Run-Time Infrastructure (RTI), considerable performance improvements can be achieved. As visualization is important in understanding such a simulation, some issues involved in providing visualization support for the supply-chain simulation are also discussed.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 11th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems (SEAMS)
CL  - Austin, TX
AB  - The development of safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is expanding due to the Internet of Things' promise to make high-integrity applications and services part of everyday life. This expansion is seen in the dependencies some connected vehicles have on cloud services that provide guidance and accident avoidance / detection features. Such systems are safety-critical since failure could result in serious injury or death. Due to the severe consequences of failure, fault-tolerance, reliability and dependability should be primary driving qualities in the design and development of these systems. However, the cost of the analysis, evaluation and certification activities needed to ensure that the possibility of failure has been sufficiently mitigated is significantly higher than the cost of developing traditional software.Our group is exploring the addition of dynamic adaptive capabilities to safety-critical systems. We postulate that dynamic adaptivity could provide several enhancements to safety-critical systems. It would allow systems to reason about the environment within which they are sited and about their internal operation enabling decision making that is context-specific and appropriately prioritized. However, the addition of adaptivity with the associated overhead of reasoning is not without drawbacks particularly when hard real-time safety-critical systems are involved. In this brief position paper, we explore some of the questions and concerns that are raised when dynamic adaptive behavior is introduced into safety-critical systems as well as ways that the Architecture Analysis & Design Language (AADL) can be used to model / analyze such systems.

AB  - Current challenges in sustainable water resources management have created demand for integrated, flexible and easy to use environmental simulation models which are able to simulate the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the hydrological cycle with a sufficient degree of certainty. Along with these models various accompanying applications are needed in order to support the setup, application and evaluation of models or the search for optimized management alternatives. Among them are tools for automated parameterization and sensitivity analyses of models and graphical user interfaces that support model setup and visualization of simulation results.Existing applications which have been developed to cover these demands are often constrained to specific scales or purposes and can not easily be adapted to meet different challenges. Reasons for this can be a monolithic software architecture that hinders implementation of extensions, constraining software licenses that permit modifications to the system or simply a closed code base. As a consequence resulting from this shortage, modelling frameworks that allow an easy implementation and extension of component based simulation models have gained increasing attention from both model developers and users during the last years.This paper presents various applications of the Jena Adaptable Modelling System (JAMS) that cover the abovementioned subjects while focusing especially on the reuse of existing modelling components. First we show how spatial and temporal domains typical for environmental models can be represented in JAMS (figure 1). Then we describe the implementation of a distributed hydrological model and its application in more detail. Following, we point out how the hydrological model can be extended by new components in order to allow the simulation of nutrient dynamics. After a brief description of the single components, we present results of their application to a meso-scale catchment. The last part of the paper focuses on parameter optimization procedures in JAMS models. After briefly showing how optimization algorithms can be represented as JAMS components, results of an application of an evolutionary optimization procedure to the hydrological model discussed earlier are presented.[GRAPHICS].

M3  - Article
AB  - Autonomous cyber-physical systems (CPS) can improve safety and efficiency for safety-critical applications, but require rigorous testing before deployment. The complexity of these systems often precludes the use of formal verification and real-world testing can be too dangerous during development. Therefore, simulation-based techniques have been developed that treat the system under test as a black box operating in a simulated environment. Safety validation tasks include finding disturbances in the environment that cause the system to fail (falsification), finding the most-likely failure, and estimating the probability that the system fails. Motivated by the prevalence of safety-critical artificial intelligence, this work provides a survey of state-of-the-art safety validation techniques for CPS with a focus on applied algorithms and their modifications for the safety validation problem. We present and discuss algorithms in the domains of optimization, path planning, reinforcement learning, and importance sampling. Problem decomposition techniques are presented to help scale algorithms to large state spaces, which are common for CPS. A brief overview of safety-critical applications is given, including autonomous vehicles and aircraft collision avoidance systems. Finally, we present a survey of existing academic and commercially available safety validation tools.

AB  - The paper analyses and studies the classification and characteristics of Internet of Things (IoT) information, and discusses the construction and application of Hadoop Cloud Platform. This paper mainly carries out from two aspects. One is to design the system architecture of the Open Platform for Data Simulation Resources of the IoT and design the key modules. A platform for data simulation resources of the IoT is built to provide the running environment and external services for the sensor data simulation model established. On the other hand, it is the key method to study the simulation data model based on IoT sensors. That is, based on the research environment of the IoT built by the existing laboratories, collect the data of sensors, analyze and study the characteristics of sensors in the IoT, and design the key algorithms for data simulation. This paper presents two key models for sensor data modeling: the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) prediction model and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model based on IoT data, which are suitable for different data volumes. Extensive simulations are executed to validate the remarkable nature in Hadoop platform, in terms of prediction accuracy and training efficiency under different working condition.

AB  - In the emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT), wireless sensors are the vital mediators between the physical world and the cyber space. In many telemonitoring and interactive applications, high-rate data streams up to MB/s may need to be transported from the wireless sensors to the cloud computing servers over the Internet and processed by the remote servers in quasi-real time fashion. These applications generally demand substantial reduction of communication bandwidth, response latency and power consumption of these Internet-based cyber-physical systems. To tackle these demands for efficient use of communication, computing and power resources, we developed an advanced wearable sensor platform (AWSP) which integrated a powerful system-on-chip (SoC) processor, a smart power management unit, a highly accurate real-time clock and multi-function peripherals into a miniature module. This AWSP designed to function is capable of performing sophisticated data pre-processing including real-time artifact and noise removal, data compression, and even feature extraction before uploading the data to other devices like mobile phone, computer, etc. Furthermore, with the installation of embedded real-time Linux operating system, this sensor provides a familiar and powerful software development environment for system developers to build their computation-intensive real-time applications. This paper presents the design and development process.

The basic idea is to create a model of the software development process that can be interpreted by a simulator. A student using the simulator can control the simulated project interactively, managing it more or less successfully. In this paper, the simulation system and the model description language are presented. Then a new simulation model, the Quality Assurance (QA) model, is introduced. This model covers all activities of software development from requirements' specification to product delivery. The model especially emphasizes the effects of quality assurance activities.

TI  - Network intrusion detection system for DDoS attacks in ICS using deep autoencoders
T2  - WIRELESS NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - Anomaly detection in industrial control and cyber-physical systems has gained much attention over the past years due to the increasing modernisation and exposure of industrial environments. Current dangers to the connected industry include the theft of industrial intellectual property, denial of service, or the compromise of cloud components; all of which might result in a cyber-attack across the operational network. However, most scientific work employs device logs, which necessitate substantial understanding and preprocessing before they can be used in anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) architecture based on a deep autoencoder trained on network flow data, which has the advantage of not requiring prior knowledge of the network topology or its underlying architecture. Experimental results show that the proposed model can detect anomalies, caused by distributed denial of service attacks, providing a high detection rate and low false alarms, outperforming the state-of-the-art and a baseline model in an unsupervised learning environment. Furthermore, the deep autoencoder model can detect abnormal behaviour in legitimate devices after an attack. We also demonstrate the suitability of the proposed NIDS in a real industrial plant from the alimentary sector, analysing the false positive rate and the viability of the data generation, filtering and preprocessing procedure for a near real time scenario. The suggested NIDS architecture is a low-cost solution that uses only fifteen network-based features, requires minimal processing, operates in unsupervised mode, and is straightforward to deploy in real-world scenarios.

AB  - In this paper, we present ML-Quadrat, an open-source research prototype that is based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and the state of the art in the literature of Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) for smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Its envisioned users are mostly software developers who might not have deep knowledge and skills in the heterogeneous IoT platforms and the diverse Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, specifically regarding Machine Learning (ML). ML-Quadrat is released under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license on Github(l). Additionally, we demonstrate an early tool prototype of DriotData, a web-based Low-Code platform targeting citizen data scientists and citizen/end-user software developers. DriotData exploits and adopts ML-Quadrat in the industry by offering an extended version of it as a subscription-based service to companies, mainly Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SME). The current preliminary version of DriotData has three web-based model editors: text-based, tree-/form-based and diagram-based. The latter is designed for domain experts in the problem or use case domains (namely the IoT vertical domains) who might not have knowledge and skills in the field of IT. Finally, a short video demonstrating the tools is available on YouTube: https://youtu.be/VAuz25w0a5k.

CL  - Washington, DC
AB  - The Human-System Interaction (HSI) approach focuses on analysis, design, and evaluation of work systems for humans to interact with technical systems ergonomically designed for human use. An initial framework is developed for human factors and ergonomics (HFE) design requirements with regard to occupational safety and health (OSH). The framework refers to concept, criteria and intended user populations in work systems design. Some future work systems in industry 4.0 and cyber-physical systems call for emphasising human information processing with interchange of information variable and dynamic in quantity, quality and time. Taking into account new solutions and challenges in digital manufacturing, selected requirements, explanations, examples and references should inform manufacturers and health and safety experts at the shop floor level about HFE and OSH. Information presented at an internet platform, should assist in how to integrate these factors into construction of machinery or other technical installations, in workplace, equipment and software design and for practical use in HSI.

AB  - Incorporating performance monitoring capabilities to embedded environments, especially on critical systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems, requires a negligible intrusion to ensure the CPS environment performance and data quality. The monitoring design must be tailored to fit the system's needs instead of being limited to a single monitoring approach. In this paper, we extend a monitoring framework to encompass three monitoring approaches: Periodic-, Execution-flow-, and Job-based, focusing on the evaluation of overhead, latency, and jitter for each of them. We have implemented and evaluated these approaches over the Monitoring Framework design, where none of them presented an average impact on the system execution time higher than 0.3%. While the Job-based monitoring presented better results in terms of impact over the tasks execution and memory consumption, the Execution-flow-based monitoring presented better results for jitter, both on the impact over task execution time and the monitoring latency.

TI  - An online machine learning framework for early detection of product failures in an Industry 4.0 context
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING
M3  - Article
AB  - Current paradigms such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems are transforming production environments, where related processes are not only faster and with higher standards, but also more flexible and adaptable to changes in the environment. To address the ever-increasing flexibility requirements while keeping current production standards, a new set of technologies is needed. This paper presents an IoT machine learning and orchestration framework, applied to detection of failures of surface mount devices during production. The paper shows how to build a scalable and flexible system for real-time, online machine learning. Furthermore, the approach is evaluated by using a novel and realistic simulation of a production line for electronic devices as a case study. The system evaluation is done in a holistic manner by analyzing various aspects involving the software architecture, computational scalability, model accuracy, production performance, among others.

CL  - Krakow, POLAND
AB  - The optimization of the construction of gears leading to the minimization of dynamic effects and to meet all basic criteria is in many cases only possible by applying numerical methods. The models allow determining the influence of a range of factors on the dynamic phenomena. Proper experimental tests are often not possible because the number of options of influencing factor sets is very large. Using simulation models allows limiting the volume of experimental studies to the necessary minimum, and hence is beneficial from the economic standpoint. The paper describes numerical and laboratory researches on the influence of selected construction, technological and operational factors on the dynamic effects and vibroactivity in gears. Numerical analyses were performed using a custom-developed dynamic model of a test stand with the gears operating in the circulating power system. The model's details were presented at the International Congress on Technical Diagnostics in 2008. The idea behind this article is to present selected results of simulation calculations and laboratory tests to determine the possibility of minimizing the noise and vibration of gears. Selected results of the calculations were also compared with the results of laboratory tests to demonstrate the high compatibility of the two test methods.

TI  - A comparative risk analysis on CyberShip system with STPA-Sec, STRIDE and CORAS
T2  - COMPUTERS & SECURITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The widespread use of software-intensive cyber systems in critical infrastructures such as ships (Cyber-Ships) has brought huge benefits, yet it has also opened new avenues for cyber attacks to potentially disrupt operations. Cyber risk assessment plays a vital role in identifying cyber threats and vulnera-bilities that can be exploited to compromise cyber systems. Understanding the nature of cyber threats and their potential risks and impact is essential to improve the security and resilience of cyber systems, and to build systems that are secure by design and better prepared to detect and mitigate cyber at-tacks. A number of methodologies have been proposed to carry out these analyses. This paper evaluates and compares the application of three risk assessment methodologies: system theoretic process analy-sis (STPA-Sec), STRIDE and CORAS for identifying threats and vulnerabilities in a CyberShip system. We specifically selected these three methodologies because they identify threats not only at the component level, but also threats or hazards caused due to the interaction between components, resulting in sets of threats identified with each methodology and relevant differences. Moreover, STPA-Sec, which is a variant of the STPA, is widely used for safety and security analysis of cyber physical systems (CPS); CORAS offers a framework to perform cyber risk assessment in a top-down approach that aligns with STPA-Sec; and STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation,Information disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) considers threat at the component level as well as during the interaction that is similar to STPA-Sec. As a result of this analysis, this paper highlights the pros and cons of these methodologies, illustrates areas of special applicability, and suggests that their complementary use as threats identified through STRIDE can be used as an input to CORAS and STPA-Sec to make these methods more structured.(c) 2023 The Authors.

TI  - CUDA-Based Method to Boost Target Performance Evaluation of Space Systems for Automatic Mobile Object Identification and Localization
T2  - PROGRAMMING AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The complex organization and application conditions of space systems for automatic identification and localization of mobile objects, which include the automatic identification system (AIS) and automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) system, determine the choice of simulation models for the mathematical formalization of their operation. Simulation modeling of satellite constellations capable of receiving, processing, and retransmitting AIS and ADS-B signals can take a significant amount of time when being used to substantiate circuit design solutions for satellites and plans for their further application given a large number of radiation sources to be simulated (e.g., for the AIS, their number exceeds 500 thousand). One of the methods for solving this problem is parallel computing based on the compute unified device architecture (CUDA) technology. However, due to the specificity of machine instruction execution on NVIDIA GPUs, software quality depends heavily on GPU memory allocation efficiency and algorithms for program code execution. In this paper, we propose a method for target performance evaluation of space systems for automatic identification and localization of mobile objects; the method uses massively parallel computations on GPUs to provide a significant reduction in simulation time, which is especially important for multi-satellite constellations. The efficiency of the method is confirmed by model-cybernetic experiments carried out on various software and hardware platforms.

TI  - Efficient Load-Time Diversity for an Embedded Real-Time Operating System

CP  - 39th International Conference on Computer Safety, Reliability and Security (SAFECOMP)
CL  - Lisbon, PORTUGAL
AB  - Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are threatened by cyber attacks just as any computing system. Even worse, due to them being embedded into the physical world, consequences can be catastrophic. The widespread use of unsafe languages and limited operating system protections makes code-reuse attacks particularly dangerous to smaller CPS. Existing effective countermeasures are either not applicable because resources are limited, or they introduce an unacceptable overhead. In this work, we propose a fine-grained load-time software diversity approach that is enabled by compile-time preparations. Its linear-time loading algorithm makes it feasible for resource-constrained CPS. We demonstrate our approach by fully diversifying an application including the real-time operating system FreeRTOS on an ARM real-time microcontroller. Our performance evaluation using the TACLe benchmark suite shows that the worst-case execution time overhead is acceptable.

TI  - System identification using hierarchical fuzzy neural networks with stable learning algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hierarchical fuzzy neural networks can use less rules to model nonlinear system with high accuracy. But the normal training method for hierarchical fuzzy neural networks is very complex. In this paper we modify the backpropagation approach and employ a time-varying learning rate that is determined from input-output data and model structure. Stable learning algorithms for the premise and the consequence parts of the fuzzy rules are proposed. The calculation of the learning rate does not need any prior information such as estimation of the modeling error bounds. The new algorithms are very simple, we can train each sub-block of the hierarchical fuzzy neural networks independently.

AB  - We propose a two-staged fuzzy clustering algorithm to train radial basis function neural networks. The novelty of the contribution lies in the way we handle the input training data information between the two stages of the algorithm. The back-propagation method is employed to optimize the network parameters. The number of hidden nodes is determined by the iterative implementation of the fuzzy clustering and the back-propagation. Simulation results show that the methodology produces accurate models compared to the standard and more sophisticated techniques reported in the literature.

TI  - Improving Software Flexibility for Business Process Changes
T2  - BUSINESS & INFORMATION SYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In times of continuous change, companies need to adjust their business processes to gain sustainable competitive advantage. Resulting changes in the company's IT currently require the involvement of developers from departments that are mostly not aligned with the business. These changes often result in high transaction and labor costs. The article presents a platform-based method to adjust business processes with the aim of increasing both efficiency and flexibility compared to current approaches. The core of our work is an evaluation against traditional component-based software development using a sound simulation model. Three real-world scenarios of business process change show that despite a slight increase in transaction costs - our suggested method decreases labor costs while increasing operational flexibility.

TI  - Comparing Constraints Mined From Execution Logs to Understand Software Evolution
T2  - 2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE AND EVOLUTION (ICSME 2019)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 35th IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)
CL  - Cleveland, OH
AB  - Complex software systems evolve frequently, e.g., when introducing new features or fixing bugs during maintenance. However, understanding the impact of such changes on system behavior is often difficult. Many approaches have thus been proposed that analyze systems before and after changes, e.g., by comparing source code, model-based representations, or system execution logs. In this paper, we propose an approach for comparing run-time constraints, synthesized by a constraint mining algorithm, based on execution logs recorded before and after changes. Specifically, automatically mined constraints define the expected timing and order of recurring events and the values of data elements attached to events. Our approach presents the differences of the mined constraints to users, thereby providing a higher-level view on software evolution and supporting the analysis of the impact of changes on system behavior. We present a motivating example and a preliminary evaluation based on a cyber-physical system controlling unmanned aerial vehicles. The results of our preliminary evaluation show that our approach can help to analyze changed behavior and thus contributes to understanding software evolution.

TI  - Carving Out Control Code: Automated Identification of Control Software in Autopilot Systems
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyber-physical systems interact with the world through software controlling physical effectors. Carefully designed controllers, implemented as safety-critical control software, also interact with other parts of the software suite, and may be difficult to separate, verify, or maintain. Moreover, some software changes, not intended to impact control system performance, do change controller response through a variety of means including interaction with external libraries or unmodeled changes only existing in the cyber system (e.g., exception handling). As a result, identifying safety-critical control software, its boundaries with other embedded software in the system, and the way in which control software evolves could help developers isolate, test, and verify control implementation, and improve control software development. In this work we present an automated technique, based on a novel application of machine learning, to detect commits related to control software, its changes, and how the control software evolves. We leverage messages from developers (e.g., commit comments), and code changes themselves to understand how control software is refined, extended, and adapted over time. We examine three distinct, popular, real-world, safety-critical autopilots-ArduPilot, Paparazzi UAV, and LibrePilot to test our method demonstrating an effective detection rate of 0.95 for control-related code changes.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 39th International Conference on Computer Safety, Reliability and Security (SAFECOMP)
CL  - Lisbon, PORTUGAL
AB  - Safety assurance cases (ACs) are structured arguments that assert the safety of cyber-physical systems. ACs use reasoning steps, or strategies, to show how a safety claim is decomposed into subclaims which are then supported by evidence. In practice, ACs are informal, and thus it is difficult to check whether these decompositions are valid and no subclaims are missed. This may lead to the approval of fallacious safety arguments and thus the deployment of unsafe systems. Fully formalizing ACs to facilitate rigorous evaluation is not realistic due to the complexity of creating and comprehending such ACs. We take an intermediate approach by formalizing several types of decomposition strategies, proving the conditions under which they are deductive, and applying them as templates that guard against common errors in ACs. We demonstrate our approach on two scenarios: creation of ACs with deductive reasoning steps and evaluation and improvement of existing ACs.

CL  - SANT ANGELO ISCHIA, ITALY
AB  - Evaluation, prioritization and selection of candidate requirements are of tremendous importance and impact for subsequent software development. Effort, time as well as quality constraints have to be taken into account. Typically, different stakeholders have conflicting priorities and the requirements of all these stakeholders have to be balanced in an appropriate way to ensure maximum value of the final set of requirements. Tradeoff analysis is needed to proactively explore the impact of certain decisions in terms of all the criteria and constraints.The proposed method called Quantitative WinWin uses an evolutionary approach to provide support for requirements negotiations. The novelty of the presented idea is four-fold. Firstly, it iteratively uses the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) for a step-wise analysis with the aim to balance the stakeholders' preferences related to different classes of requirements. Secondly, requirements selection is based on predicting and rebalancing its impact on effort, time and quality. Both prediction and rebalancing uses the simulation model prototype GENSIM. Thirdly, alternative solution sets offered for decision-making are developed incrementally based on thresholds for the degree of importance of requirements and heuristics to find a best fit to constraints. Finally, trade-off analysis is used to determine non-dominated extensions of the maximum value that is achievable under resource and quality constraints. As a main result, quantitative WinWin proposes a small number of possible sets of requirements from which the actual decision-maker can finally select the most appropriate solution.

T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - As the extension of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), cyber-physical-social systems (CPSSs) seamlessly integrate cyber space, physical space, and social space. CPSS provide a more comprehensive smart space of perception for Reinforcement Learning (RL), so as to lead a revolution in Artificial Intelligence (AI), which urgently require innovation in computing system architecture. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review and perspectives of RL architecture for collaborative computing system in CPSS. Firstly, we analyze CPSS AI's features from data perspective, including multi-modal data fusion from multi-spaces, and rule discover and representation, collaborative computing system architectures for multi-spaces, intelligent decision-making (policy) discovery. After that, we propose to use the action aware transition tensor to fuse the CPSS data for collaborative RL. Then the typical architectures and methods of RL are surveyed. Furthermore, a tensor based unified collaborative computing reinforcement architecture are proposed for CPSS AI, including architecture and optimal policy solution. In the end, we summarize the paper and discuss the future work.

TI  - Techno-economic evaluation of internal combustion engine based cogeneration system retrofits in Canadian houses - A preliminary study
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A preliminary techno-economic evaluation of retrofitting reciprocating internal combustion engine based cogeneration into existing Canadian houses for the purpose of achieving or approaching net-zero energy rating is presented. Primary energy and electricity consumption, associated greenhouse gas emissions and tolerable capital cost are used as indicators. A whole building simulation model was used to simulate the performance of a commonly used cogeneration system architecture with thermal storage in "typical" single storey houses located in Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver, representing the five major climatic regions of Canada. The system is assumed to sell excess electricity to the grid at the purchase price. A high efficiency auxiliary boiler is included to supply heat when cogeneration unit capacity is not sufficient to meet the heating load. The effect of thermal storage capacity, interest rate and acceptable payback period on the overall performance was evaluated through a sensitivity analysis. The findings suggest that internal combustion engine based cogeneration provides a promising option to achieve net-zero energy rating for Canadian houses, and therefore more detailed studies focusing on the entire Canadian housing stock are needed.

AB  - The development of a flight simulator is a challenging work because of its complexity and tremendous cost. We implement a prototype composed of PC cluster and have proved its coordination character as a flight training device. This paper describes the architecture of the flight simulator, the software development tools and hardware platform. These software and hardware constitute a PC based simulation environment and make the expense of the simulation application affordable. We also present the simulation modeling process. For the integrity of the cueing system, we designed a virtual prototype of motion system and connected it to the flight simulator. The integrated system gave us a chance to testify the coordination of the simulator. The verification method and result are presented to show the feasibility of the design based on PC.

AB  - Simulation games can help teaching and learning in several areas of Software Engineering. One important research issue is providing support for simulation games development, making the results of their adoption successful in Software Engineering courses. In this work, we identify a set of requirements focusing on some of the Constructivist learning theories. These requirements were used to evaluate Software Engineering simulation games. Based on these requirements, we created FASENG, a framework for development of Software Engineering simulation games. FASENG has three main components: simulation model, simulator, and simulation engine. Since there is a clear structural and conceptual separation among them, they can be reused in other development environments. In order to check the framework flexibility, we developed two distinct Software Engineering simulation games. The two main results of this research are a better understanding of Software Engineering simulation games requirements and the development of FASENG.

TI  - A Systematic Literature Review on Mining LTL Specifications
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specifications play a crucial role in the verification process of cyber-physical systems, increasing the guarantees of their correctness. These specifications are vital for ensuring that both hardware and software components behave as expected, especially in complex real-world scenarios. In the last decades, researchers have developed several methodologies and tools to automatically generate LTL specifications, creating an urgent need to organize and synthesize existing literature to ease entry into this field and guide future research efforts. Therefore, starting from a pool of over 3000 papers extracted from the Scopus database in the temporal range 2000-2024, this paper employs the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology to produce a systematic review of mining LTL specifications of hardware and software systems. In particular, we provide a taxonomy of the methods and describe with significant detail all the relevant techniques present at the state of the art. Finally, we discuss the challenges of mining LTL specifications and explore potential directions and opportunities for future research.

TI  - Optimization via Statistical Emulation and Uncertainty Quantification: Hosting Capacity Analysis of Distribution Networks
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In power systems modelling, optimization methods based on certain objective function(s) are widely used to provide solutions for decision makers. For complex high-dimensional problems, such as network hosting capacity evaluation of intermittent renewables, simplifications are often used which can lead to the 'optimal' solution being suboptimal or nonoptimal. Even where the optimization problem is resolved, it would still be valuable to introduce some diversity to the solution for long-term planning purposes. This paper introduces a general framework for solving optimization for power systems that treats an optimization problem as a history match problem which is resolved via statistical emulation and uncertainty quantification. Emulation constructs fast statistical approximations to the complex computer simulation model in order to identify appropriate choices of candidate solutions for given objective function(s). Uncertainty quantification is adopted to capture multiple sources of uncertainty attached to each candidate solution and is conducted via Bayes linear analysis. It is demonstrated through a hosting capacity case study involving variable wind generation and active network management. The proposed method effectively identified not only the maximum connectable capacities but also a diverse set of near-optimal solutions, and so provided flexible guides for using the existing network to maximize the benefits of renewable generation.

TI  - Improving Effectiveness of Simulation-Based Inference in the Massively Parallel Regime
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulation-based Inference (SBI) is a widely used set of algorithms to learn the parameters of complex scientific simulation models. While primarily run on CPUs in High-Performance Compute clusters, these algorithms have been shown to scale in performance when developed to be run on massively parallel architectures such as GPUs. While parallelizing existing SBI algorithms provides us with performance gains, this might not be the most efficient way to utilize the achieved parallelism. This work proposes a new parallelism-aware adaptation of an existing SBI method, namely approximate Bayesian computation with Sequential Monte Carlo(ABC-SMC). This new adaptation is designed to utilize the parallelism not only for performance gain, but also toward qualitative benefits in the learnt parameters. The key idea is to replace the notion of a single 'step-size' hyperparameter, which governs how the state space of parameters is explored during learning, with step-sizes sampled from a tuned Beta distribution. This allows this new ABC-SMC algorithm to more efficiently explore the state-space of the parameters being learned. We test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to learn parameters for an epidemiology model running on a Tesla T4 GPU. Compared to the parallelized state-of-the-art SBI algorithm, we get similar quality results in similar to 100x fewer simulations and observe similar to 80x lower run-to-run variance across 10 independent trials.

AB  - We present our evaluation of a simulation mechanism for understanding non-functional properties of computer software. Considering the prevalence of computer-based appliances, such as mobile hand-held devices, it is important for software to have high performance and energy-efficiency. Understanding the timing of software execution is essential for estimating such non-functional properties of software.The traditional way of simulating the timing behavior is based on cycle-accurate computer hardware simulators. Such simulators are orders of magnitude slower than real hardware, and thus unsuitable for software developers. Our simulation methodology is based on execution-driven simulation. We use a novel approach to bind simulation models together with dynamic binary translation of target software. Our experimentation with a production-quality simulator, QEMU, shows that reasonable simulation times and accuracy can be achieved by using this method.

TI  - On Evaluating Self-Adaptive and Self-Healing Systems using Chaos Engineering

CP  - 3rd IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - With the growing adoption of self-adaptive systems in various domains, there is an increasing need for strategies to assess their correct behavior. In particular self-healing systems, which aim to provide resilience and fault-tolerance, often deal with unanticipated failures in critical and highly dynamic environments. Their reactive and complex behavior makes it challenging to assess if these systems execute according to the desired goals. Recently, several studies have expressed concern about the lack of systematic evaluation methods for self-healing behavior.In this paper, we propose CHESS, an approach for the systematic evaluation of self-adaptive and self-healing systems that builds on chaos engineering. Chaos engineering is a methodology for subjecting a system to unexpected conditions and scenarios. It has shown great promise in helping developers build resilient microservice architectures and cyber-physical systems. CHESS turns this idea around by using chaos engineering to evaluate how well a self-healing system can withstand such perturbations. We investigate the viability of this approach through an exploratory study on a self-healing smart office environment. The study helps us explore the promises and limitations of the approach, as well as identify directions where additional work is needed. We conclude with a summary of lessons learned.

CL  - Brisbane, AUSTRALIA
AB  - Assuring dependability of complex mission-critical cyber-physical systems in various domains including automotive and agriculture is becoming an increasingly demanding challenge. This is due to the ongoing evolution of land vehicles and machinery such as tractors and implements from mainly electromechanical devices towards software-driven and interconnected processing units enabling highly automated applications like smart farming. In particular, the underlying communication infrastructure of the involved distributed subsystems is subject to high demands in view of functional but also quality aspects like security and safety. And, testing the countless component interactions against associated criteria is not feasible without sophisticated techniques and tooling support, which continuous engineering solutions tackle with experimental evidence based on virtual evaluation environments. While these facilitate advanced practices for handling system complexity, formal verification of specific system properties remains a complementary and effective part of modern product development.In this paper, we present a generic methodical concept which combines virtual experimentation with formal analysis to substantiate decisions regarding the design and implementation of dependable CPS. We validate our approach by means of a case study on a common evaluation problem with regard to weighing up competing dependability attributes in the context of resource-constraint communication. To this end, we instantiate a virtual testbed based on the established VCIP reference architecture and FERAL simulation framework and we conduct empirical trials using systematic fault-injection combined with analytical proofing in terms of a trade-off evaluation. Specifically, we generate different CAN data frame variants during back-to-back tests for assessing the impact of cyclic redundancy checks and message authentication codes on the level of functional safety and security, respectively. The results show the general viability of our approach in conjunction with the capabilities of the evaluation platform for the continuous verification and validation of quality-related characteristics of a CPS under development.

AB  - Modern applications for cyber-physical systems, such as autonomous driving, are more and more often characterized by the interconnection of software components with mixed levels of safety and security deployed on the same hardware platform. Virtualization by means of hypervisor technology is notably the most common approach to allow for the integration of such software components upon the same platform. The Data Distribution Service (DDS) is a publisher/subscriber middle-ware protocol that is establishing as a reference solution to put in communication distributed software components. Given these developments, the need for efficiently supporting DDS-based communication in virtualized systems is emerging in several industrial fields, especially when DDS communications interest in-platform software components. This paper presents the design of a virtualized DDS communication architecture for multidomain systems based on para-virtualization and hypervisor technology. The design is then specialized and implemented for the popular Xen hypervisor and Linux operating system, under which a set of implementation options are systematically studied and compared with a wide experimental evaluation.

TI  - Digital Twins for the built environment: learning from conceptual and process models in manufacturing
T2  - ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The overall aim of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm in the built environment by drawing inspiration from existing DT research in manufacturing. The DT is a Product Life Management information construct that has migrated to the built environment while research on the subject has grown intensely in recent years. Common to early research phases, DT research in the built environment has developed organically, setting the basis for mature definitions and robust research frameworks. As DT research in manufacturing is the most developed, this paper seeks to advance the understanding of DTs in the built environment by analysing how the DT systems reported in manufacturing literature are structured and how they function. Firstly, this paper presents a thorough review and a comparison of DT, cyber-physical systems (CPS), and building information modelling (BIM). Then, the results of the review and categorisation of DT structural and functional descriptions are presented. Fifty-four academic publications and industry reports were reviewed, and their structural and functional descriptions were analysed in detail. Three types of structural models (i.e. conceptual models, system architectures, and data models) and three types of functional models (process and communication models) were identified. DT maturity models were reviewed as well. From the reviewed descriptions, four categories of DT conceptual models (prototypical, model-based, interface-oriented, and servicebased) and six categories of DT process models (DT creation, DT synchronisation, asset monitoring, prognosis and simulation, optimal operations, and optimised design) were defined and its applicability to the AECO assessed. While model-based and service-based models are the most applicable to the built environment, amendments are still required. Prognosis and simulation process models are the most widely applicable for AECO use-cases. The main contribution to knowledge of this study is that it compiles the DT's structural and functional descriptions used in manufacturing and it provides the basis to develop DT conceptual and process models specific to requirements of the built environment sectors.

AB  - Space exploration and mission success are dependent upon assessing mission viability. When a new mission and vehicle are defined, a reasonable facsimile must be built to conduct trade studies. In the case of the Altair lunar lander, we have developed a simulation lab with a specific hardware and software architecture to facilitate trade studies. Our starting point is to design and implement simplified guidance and navigation and control algorithms for the lunar landing trajectory. This trajectory gets integrated into an analysis of the communications system. We are using a software and hardware platform that allows for multiple teams and companies to integrate their simulation models into a single evaluation model. We discuss the software and hardware architecture which includes autocode generation targeted for a single board computer, and Ethernet connections used for integrating multiple labs. A discussion of how to incorporate flight hardware into the simulation environment is also presented.(12)

TI  - GAN-Based LUCC Prediction via the Combination of Prior City Planning Information and Land-Use Probability
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, the world is in a period of urbanization that will accelerate the processes of land-use cover and ecological change. Thus, establishing a land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) prediction and simulation model is of great significance for understanding the process of urban change and assessing its ecological impact. In previous studies, LUCC prediction models have been mainly based on cellular automata structures that calculate a future state pixel by pixel through transition rules. Because these transition rules are usually based on the global state and each pixel is calculated according to these fixed rules, the results of these methods have room for improvement in terms of generating details and heterogeneity. In this article, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based LUCC prediction model using multiscale local spatial information is proposed. The model is based on a pix2pix GAN and an attention structure that predicts future land use through multiscale local spatial information. To validate our model, Shenzhen, a region that is experiencing rapid urbanization, was chosen as the source of the experimental data. The results indicate that the proposed method achieved the highest accuracy in both short-time interval and long-time interval scenarios. In addition, the results of the proposed method were also closest to the ground truth from the perspective of the landscape pattern.

AB  - The computer software AUSSSM TOOL, originating from the methodology of the revised-architectural-urban-soil-simultaneous simulation model (revised-AUSSSM), was developed by adopting the graphical user interface (GUI) features to support users, who can use the interactive computer display for parameter settings, simulating, visualizing, and reporting the numerical calculation results instead of complicated programming. The purpose of the AUSSSM TOOL is to determine quantitative parameters such as air temperature, exhaustive heat from air conditioning systems, energy heat balance, etc. within the urban canopy structure, which data enables the evaluation of effects of urban heat island (UHI) in concrete terms useful to urban planners, architects, engineers, and so forth in the field of urban climatology involving building scale. In addition to conducting a full numerical simulation, in order to simplify a comparison among complex factors influencing UHI, numerical experiments based on Taguchi design of experiment theory (DOE) were carried out. The results of the numerical experiments were stored in a database and ready to be instantly grasped by any inexperienced user corresponding to their specified conditions. This paper describes the fundamental method of the revised-AUSSSM, the objectives of related software development, and the structures of the AUSSSM TOOL and the techniques comprising its algorithm to present the numerical simulation results in particular.

AB  - This doctoral dissertation proposes a novel approach to enhance the development of smart services for the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The proposed approach offers abstraction and automation to the software engineering processes, as well as the Data Analytics (DA) and Machine Learning (ML) practices. This is realized in an integrated and seamless manner. We implement and validate the proposed approach by extending an open source modeling tool, called ThingML. ThingML is a domain-specific language and modeling tool with code generation for the IoT/CPS domain. Neither ThingML nor any other IoT/CPS modeling tool supports DA/ML at the modeling level. Therefore, as the primary contribution of the doctoral dissertation, we add the necessary syntax and semantics concerning DA/ML methods and techniques to the modeling language of ThingML. Moreover, we support the APIs of several ML libraries and frameworks for the automated generation of the source code of the target software in Python and Java. Our approach enables platform-independent, as well as platform-specific models. Further, we assist in carrying out semi-automated DA/ML tasks by offering Automated ML (AutoML), in the background (in expert mode), and through model-checking constraints and hints at design-time. Finally, we consider three use case scenarios from the domains of network security, smart energy systems and energy exchange markets.

TI  - Dependability evaluation of time triggered architecture using simulation
T2  - COMPUTING AND INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The method presented in this paper uses a generic C-language written simulation model of an embedded distributed computer system aimed for a safety-critical control application. The considered system is built using Time Triggered Architecture (TTA) concepts. The aim of the presented simulation method is to evaluate the system capability to tolerate a chosen category of faults. The model, being written in ANSI-C, is portable and machine-independent. Its structure is modular and flexible, so that the system to be studied and the experiment setting can easily be changed. The functionality of this model is demonstrated on a set of fault injection experiments aimed mainly to evaluate the correctness of the Time Triggered Protocol (TTP/C) that implements the abstract concepts of TTA. These experiments were done within the EU/IST project Fault Injection for Time triggered architecture (FIT).

TI  - Feasibility Study of Hydration Monitoring Using Microwaves- Part 1: A Model of Microwave Property Changes With Dehydration
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF ELECTROMAGNETICS RF AND MICROWAVES IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dehydration is a prevalent condition that can have profound health consequences. If detected early, it can often be treated by oral fluid replacement (drinking or eating). However, existing assessment techniques lack the accuracy and/or convenience for ongoing monitoring, motivating the development of novel methods. We propose using low-power microwave measurements (2-12 GHz) at the extremities tomonitor human hydration, relying on the strong relationship between dielectric properties of tissues and water content. Electromagnetic simulations of realistic models are used to explore changes in microwave signals transmitted through the forearm to changes in hydration. Tissue properties are adjusted according to expected changes in water content, and average dielectric properties are estimated from signals transmitted through the arm by ultrawideband antennas placed in contact with the tissues. A causal relationship between weight loss due to water loss and dielectric permittivity is found in human simulation models. Little relationship is found with conductivity. The theoretical groundwork for hydration assessment with microwaves is developed through a model which relates changes in total body water content with changes in microwave properties at the extremities. This model could be useful formonitoring hydration in at-risk populations such as older adults and athletes.

CP  - European Simulation and Modelling Conference (ESM 2013)
CL  - Lancaster Univ, Lancaster, UNITED KINGDOM
AB  - JAPROSIM is a free and open source discrete event simulation (DES) framework implemented in Java programming language for building discrete event simulation models. Separation of concerns (SOC) is one of the basic principles applied in design in order to improve software quality. Aspect oriented programming (AOP) has been proposed as a new technology that claims the application of this principle in the best way, through the modularisation of crosscutting concerns in additional units namely, aspects. In this paper, the main JAPROSIM crosscutting concerns are identified and adequate solutions using the AspectJ language are presented. An empirical evaluation of the Aspect Oriented version of JAPROSIM is. performed using the AOPmetrics tool. The results obtained show that the separation of JAPROSIM crosscutting concerns improves its quality attributes as modularity, understandability, maintainability, reusability, and testability.

CP  - 19th Drive Train Technology Conference (ATK)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) connect mechanics, electrics and electronics as well as software. Considering the interactions between these domains is a major challenge in product development. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) enables cross-domain system development, based on commonly understood system architectures. However, there is still a gap in using MBSE for development, especially in mechanics. Systematic evaluation of design decisions based on system architecture models is not done. The strong simulation methods predicting physical product behaviour are not well connected to the evolving system architecture. We propose a new approach for connecting simulation and design models in a System Modelling Language (SysML) system model using the example of a combustion engine's cooling circuit. The electric-mechanical coolant pump is chosen for design. The design processes of the hydrodynamic pump wheel and the volume flow controller are modelled as workflows in SysML. Here, we integrate design models for the pump wheel and the controller into the workflows. Thereby, parameters of the pump wheel and controller are calculated. Design results are automatically transferred to CAD. A workflow is created, testing the cooling circuit's behaviour against requirements, combining a Simulink control model and a Simcenter Amesim heat transfer model. The approach results in a framework for automated design and test processes.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SIGNALS & SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Photoplethysmography (PPG) contains information about the health condition of the heart and blood vessels. Cardiovascular system modeling using PPG signal measurements can represent, analyze, and predict the cardiovascular system. Methods: This study aims to make a cardiovascular system model using a Windkessel model by dividing the blood vessels into seven segments. This process involves the PPG signal of the fingertips and toes for further analysis to obtain the condition of the elasticity of the blood vessels as the main parameter. The method is to find the Resistance, Inductance, and Capacitance (RLC) value of each segment of the body through the equivalent equation between the electronic unit and the cardiovascular unit. The modeling made is focused on PPG parameters in the form of stiffness index, the time delay (ot), and augmentation index. Results: The results of the model simulation using PSpice were then compared with the results of measuring the PPG signal to analyze changes in the behavior of the PPG signal taken from ten healthy people with an average age of 46 years, compared to ten cardiac patients with an average age of 48 years. It is found that decreasing 20% of capacitance value and the arterial stiffness parameter will close to cardiac patients' data. Compared with the measurement results, the correlation of the PPG signal in the simulation model is more than 0.9. Conclusions: The proposed model is expected to be used in the early detection of arterial stiffness. It can also be used to study the dynamics of the cardiovascular system, including changes in blood flow velocity and blood pressure.

TI  - Formal Verification of a Dependable State Machine-Based Hardware Architecture for Safety-Critical Cyber-Physical Systems: Analysis, Design, and Implementation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC TESTING-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing interest in embedding digital devices in safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), such as industrial automation, aerospace, and automotive industries, attention has been directed toward proposing verifiable and reliable architectures. Prominent levels of formal verification and fault-tolerance are a requirement in dependable CPS systems to ensure system design meet the specifications and verify safety properties. In this paper, a novel formal verifiable and fault-tolerant hardware architecture uses the concepts of state machine, verification, and fault-tolerance as a foundation is developed. It is divided into four models: analysis model includes the functional requirements defined by the user, design model, the finite state machine is utilized to model the systems behavior which is tested by the NuSMV checker tool, implementation model simulates test cases on waveforms to validate the design against the requirements and verification model verifies functional and critical properties using mathematical formal linear time and computation tree logic to prove compliance with requirements and detect errors. The system uses temporal logic to formulate the required properties for a railway interlocking system (RIS) as a case study and symbolic model verifier (SMV) to demonstrate the correct execution. From the simulation results, the effectiveness of the architecture is proved for verifying critical properties and detecting design faults through majority voting circuits. The proposed architecture has been synthesized in the Altera FPGA programmable chip with logic elements 33%, 52% area overhead, and frequency as 100 MHz. The system does meet its reliability requirements with the lowest reliability 91.333687 x \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${10}<^>{-2}$$\end{document} and failure rate 0.2 failure per hour at time 60 min. Finally, we think that adopting this architecture will enhance the trustworthiness and certification of CPS systems.

AB  - Background: The vision of a fourth industrial revolution lately strongly captured the attention of research A Cyber-physical system (CPS) is one of the main drivers of this vision. Such system controls an underlying factory interacting with sensors, actuators and other systems creating systems-of-systems. A main point of interest is how these components are built and interconnected, i.e. the system's architecture, and how it might be improved to increase reliability and security.Aims: Unfortunately, there is no review available describing and identifying recent research status and progress for such architectures. Thus, in this systematic mapping study, we overview research on architecture for CPS in the context of Industry 4.0.Method: With an initial automatic search and through iterative refining, first results were gathered. Next, forward and backwards snowballing was performed to integrate the results, giving a final population of 213 papers. The output of this study is firstly a categorization and plot of architectural styles. Secondly, the categorization is extended to include security concerns.Results: In general, there is a tendency in proposing solutions in the fields of system and software architecture while other areas are visibly under-researched. Most proposals focus in digital representation, information management and integration of solutions.Conclusions: While a lot of solution proposals for different architectures exist, there are many fields uncovered and most of the solutions still lack of validation and evaluation results. Our findings highlight areas for future research and provide suggestions for investigation approaches.

AB  - Due to the continuous interaction with the physical world, autonomous cyber-physical systems (CPS) require both functional and temporal correctness. Despite recent advances in the theoretical foundation of real-time computing, leveraging these results efficiently in modern CPS platforms often requires domain expertise, and presents non-trivial challenges to many developers.To understand the practical challenges in building real-time software, we conducted a survey of 189 software issues from 7 representative CPS open-source projects. Through this exercise, we found that most bugs are due to misalignment in time between cyber and physical states. This inspires us to abstract three key temporal properties: freshness, consistency, and stability. Using a newly developed concept, Data-flow Availability (DFA), which aims to capture temporal/availability expectation of data flow, we show how these essential properties can be represented as timing constraints on data flows. To realize the timing assurance from DFA, we designed and implemented Kairos, which automatically detects and mitigates timing constraint violations. To detect violations, Kairos translates the policy definition from the API-based annotations into run-time program instrumentation. To mitigate the violations, it provides an infrastructure to bridge semantic gaps between schedulers at different abstraction layers to allow for coordinated efforts. End-to-end evaluation on three real-world CPS platforms shows that Kairos improves timing predictability and safety while introducing a minimal 2.8% run-time overhead.

AB  - The designers of safety-critical CPS that are intelligently automated using machine learning (ML) are encouraged to define invariants and utilize metrics to quantify the uncertainty of ML decisions in addition to focusing on the performance and functionality of the algorithm. Wheatman et al. [11] present Runtime Assurance for Distributed Intelligent Control Systems (RADICS) that extends the Simplex architecture [9] to provide runtime assurance for CyberPhysical Systems (CPS) being controlled by machine learning algorithms. RADICS can thus allow designers to guarantee some minimum level of system performance via a safety controller while simultaneously allowing for greater average performance via an artificial intelligence (AI) controller. Existing implementations of RADICS have focused on simulated applications such as vehicular traffic control using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) [5] and Flow [12] environments.The aim of this project is to implement RADICS in a physical environment in order to investigate and understand the limitations and challenges of physical deployments. We have selected a water treatment testbed as the application to conduct this evaluation. As a demonstration at ICCPS, we hope to use this testbed deployment to study the impact of real-world issues such as communication latencies, sensor failures, and incomplete information on the RADICS runtime assurance system. We also plan to extend the physical testbed into a hardware-in-the-loop smart city environment where the fidelity of the physical testbed will complement the scalability and flexibility of simulated components. This will allow further evaluation of assurance capabilities such as RADICS before they are deployed in the real world to ensure the safe and reliable operation of intelligent CPS. This work's novel contributions include an extension of RADICS towards real-world use in cyber-physical systems, analysis of problems inherent to the shift to physical domains, and the introduction of an ensemble-like method for calculating confidence in the RADICS white box monitor.

TI  - Model-based security engineering for cyber-physical systems: A systematic mapping study
T2  - INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have emerged to be the next generation of engineered systems driving the so-called fourth industrial revolution. CPSs are becoming more complex, open and more prone to security threats, which urges security to be engineered systematically into CPSs. Model-Based Security Engineering (MBSE) could be a key means to tackle this challenge via security by design, abstraction, and automation.Objective: We aim at providing an initial assessment of the state of the art in MBSE for CPSs (MBSE4CPS). Specifically, this work focuses on finding out I) the publication statistics of MBSE4CPS studies; 2) the characteristics of MBSE4CPS studies; and 3) the open issues of MBSE4CPS research.Method: We conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS) following a rigorous protocol that was developed based on the state-of-the-art SMS and systematic review guidelines. From thousands of relevant publications, we systematically identified 48 primary MBSE4CPS studies for data extraction and synthesis to answer predefined research questions.Results: SMS results show that for three recent years (2014-2016) the number of primary MBSE4CPS studies has increased significantly. Within the primary studies, the popularity of using Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) is comparable with the use of the standardised UML modelling notation. Most primary studies do not explicitly address specific security concerns (e.g., confidentiality, integrity) but rather focus on security analyses in general on threats, attacks or vulnerabilities. Few primary studies propose to engineer security solutions for CPSs. Many focus on the early stages of development lifecycle such as security requirement engineering or analysis.Conclusion: The SMS does not only provide the state of the art in MBSE4CPS, but also points out several open issues that would deserve more investigation, e.g., the lack of engineering security solutions for CPSs, limited tool support, too few industrial case studies, and the challenge of bridging DSLs in engineering secure CPSs.

AB  - Software development is a dynamic and complex process as there are many interacting factors throughout the lifecycle that impact cost, schedule and quality of the software project management. In addition, software industry constantly faces increasing demands for quality, productivity, and time-to-market, thus making the management of software projects one of the most difficult and challenging tasks in any software organization. Therefore, it is not surprising, that project management is one of the focus areas to which process simulation techniques based on System Dynamics (SD) have been applied in the domain of software engineering. The objective of this paper is to present concepts of a computer-based training (CBT) module for student education in software project management. The simulation component of the CBT module is implemented using the System Dynamics simulation modeling method.

AB  - Quantized deep neural networks (DNNs) have the potential to find wide applications in safety-critical cyber-physical systems implemented on processors supporting only integer arithmetic. The significant challenge therein is to ensure the correctness of the operation of the network with its approximated computation. To address this verification challenge formally, we present a methodology to encode the verification problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Our encoding is based on the bit-precise semantics of quantized neural networks, which ensures the soundness of our method. We implement our verification methodology using the Gurobi MILP solver and evaluate it on several widely used DNN benchmarks. We compare our method with state-of-the-art bit-vector encodings, which are outperformed by our MILP-based verification methodology by an order of magnitude in most cases. These experimental results establish our MILP-based verification technique as a powerful tool for developing formally verified safety-critical systems with quantized DNNs as a component.

AB  - Finding and understanding correlated performance behaviour of the individual functions of massively parallel high-performance computing (HPC) applications is a time-consuming task. In this poster, we propose filtered correlation analysis for automatically locating interdependencies in call-path performance profiles. Transforming the data into the frequency domain splits a performance phenomenon into sub-phenomena to be correlated separately. We provide the mathematical framework and an overview over the visualization, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique.

TI  - Achieving resilience in distributed software systems via self-reconfiguration
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Improvements in mobile networking combined with the ubiquitous availability and adoption of low-cost development boards have enabled the vision of mobile platforms of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), such as fractionated spacecraft and UAV swarms. Computation and communication resources, sensors, and actuators that are shared among different applications characterize these systems. The cyber-physical nature of these systems means that physical environments can affect both the resource availability and software applications that depend on resource availability. While many application development and management challenges associated with such systems have been described in existing literature, resilient operation and execution have received less attention. This paper describes our work on improving runtime support for resilience in mobile CPS, with a special focus on our runtime infrastructure that provides autonomous resilience via self-reconfiguration. We also describe the interplay between this runtime infrastructure and our design-time tools, as the later is used to statically determine the resilience properties of the former. Finally, we present a use case study to demonstrate and evaluate our design-time resilience analysis and runtime self-reconfiguration infrastructure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Service-oriented approach to fault tolerance in CPSs
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are open and interconnected embedded systems that control or interact with physical processes. Failures in CASs can lead to loss of production time, damage to the equipment and environment, or loss of life, meaning that dependability and resilience are key properties for their design. However, existing fault tolerance and safety approaches are inadequate for complex, networked and dynamic CPSs. Service-orientation, on the other hand, is generally considered to be a robust architectural style, but there is a limited amount of research on fault tolerance of service-oriented architecture (SOA), especially on distributed real-time systems. We propose an approach that utilizes the loosely coupled nature of services to implement fault tolerance using a middleware-based real-time SOA (RTSOA) for CPSs. The approach, based on the concepts of fault isolation and recovery at the service level, is empirically evaluated using a demanding bilateral teleoperation (remote handling) application. The empirical evaluation demonstrates that RTSOA supports real-time fault detection and recovery, use of services as a unit of fault isolation, and it provides capability to implement fault tolerance patterns flexibly and without significant overhead.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 16TH ACM/SPEC INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING, ICPE 2025
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 2025 International Conference on Performance Engineering-ICPE-Annual
CL  - Toronto, CANADA
AB  - The performance of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is a determining factor for their success and often needs to be guaranteed. When performance issues occur, their analysis and the identification of the root-cause should be fast. Typically, the analysis requires the association of system observations (i.e., tracing) to design and implementation artifacts. For this association, multidisciplinary domain knowledge is required, which typically resigns in the workforce but is unmanageable due to the immense and continuously increasing system complexity. This paper proposes a model-based method, the Platform Performance Suite (PPS), supported by corresponding tooling. PPS enables automated analysis for the identification of the root-cause when performance issues, like system throughput loss, occur. The cornerstone of the approach is the Lifecycle Software Architecture model which captures the domain knowledge in models by modeling all the relationships among the system artifacts from specification up to the runtime phase. The performance analysis at runtime phase is carried out on TMSC models guaranteeing the generic applicability of the method, while the connection to the other lifecycle phases enables the automated identification of the root-cause by pinpointing specific artifacts. The evaluation of the method has been carried out on a world-leading complex and high-performing CPS, the ASML TWINSCAN system, where a throughput loss needs to be addressed promptly. PPS has shown remarkable speed-up in the identification of the root-cause compared to the state-of-practice method.

TI  - Defining and Intervening on Cumulative Environmental Neurodevelopmental Risks: Introducing a Complex Systems Approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The combined effects of multiple environmental toxicants and social stressor exposures are widely recognized as important public health problems contributing to health inequities. However cumulative environmental health risks and impacts have received little attention from U.S. policy makers at state and federal levels to develop comprehensive strategies to reduce these exposures, mitigate cumulative risks, and prevent harm. An area for which the inherent limitations of current approaches to cumulative environmental health risks are well illustrated is children's neurodevel-opment, which exhibits dynamic complexity of multiple interdependent and causally linked factors and intergenerational effects.OBJECTIVES: We delineate how a complex systems approach, specifically system dynamics, can address shortcomings in environmental health risk assessment regarding exposures to multiple chemical and nonchemical stressors and reshape associated public policies.DISCUSSION: Systems modeling assists in the goal of solving problems by improving the "mental models" we use to make decisions, including regula-tory and policy decisions. In the context of disparities in children's cumulative exposure to neurodevelopmental stressors, we describe potential policy insights about the structure and behavior of the system and the types of system dynamics modeling that would be appropriate, from visual depiction (i.e., informal maps) to formal quantitative simulation models. A systems dynamics framework provides not only a language but also a set of meth-odological tools that can more easily operationalize existing multidisciplinary scientific evidence and conceptual frameworks on cumulative risks. Thus, we can arrive at more accurate diagnostic tools for children's'; environmental health inequities that take into consideration the broader social and economic environment in which children live, grow, play, and learn.

AB  - In this paper, a specific neural-based model for identification of dynamical nonlinear systems is proposed. This artificial neural network, called State-Space Neural Network (SSNN), is different from other existing neural networks. Indeed, it uses a state-space representation while being able to adapt and learn its parameters. These parameters are the neural weights which are intelligible or understandable. After learning, the SSNN therefore is able to provide a state-space model of the dynamical nonlinear system. Examples are presented which show the capability of the SSNN for identification of multivariate dynamical nonlinear systems.

TI  - Formal threat analysis of machine learning-based control systems: A study on smart healthcare systems
T2  - COMPUTERS & SECURITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern cyber-physical systems (CPSs) use the Internet of Things (IoT) to collect and exchange data efficiently, monitor device/sensor level interaction effectively, and adopt new standards effortlessly. Machine learning (ML) models are growingly used in the controllers of these IoT-enabled CPSs for pattern identification, state estimation, prediction, and anomaly detection. However, sophisticated adversaries can launch various attacks on the communication network and the hardware/firmware to introduce corrupted sensor measurements to manipulate the ML -based CPSs and create critical physical hazards. Hence, analyzing the threat space of a CPS is essential to understand the system's strength and identify the most vital resources to protect. However, existing studies have not proposed any verifiable solution for the threat analysis of ML -based CPSs. This paper presents a novel framework that uses efficient mechanisms to extract constraints from ML -based decision models and perform a formal threat analysis to identify potential false data injection (FDI) attack paths and corresponding effects on an IoT-enabled ML -based CPS. Our framework can provide us with all possible attack vectors, each representing a set of sensor measurements to be altered for a CPS given a specific set of attack attributes. The attack vectors enable us to assess the system's resiliency, thus providing insight to enhance the system's robustness. We consider an internet of medical things -enabled safety -critical CPS naming smart healthcare system (SHS) as the reference case. We validate our framework on a real SHS dataset, proving our framework's success in revealing feasible FDI attack paths. Our evaluation using synthetic and two real SHS datasets also affirms the tool's efficacy in the threat analysis of ML -based CPSs.

AB  - Software engineering of network-centric Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) enabled Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and services, involves complex design and validation challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, based on the model-driven software engineering paradigm, in particular the domain-specific modeling methodology. We focus on a sub-discipline of AI, namely Machine Learning (ML) and propose the delegation of data analytics and ML to the IoT edge. This way, we may increase the service quality of ML, for example, its availability and performance, regardless of the network conditions, as well as maintaining the privacy, security and sustainability. We let practitioners assign ML tasks to heterogeneous edge devices, including highly resource-constrained embedded microcontrollers with main memories in the order of Kilobytes, and energy consumption in the order of milliwatts. This is known as TinyML. Furthermore, we show how software models with different levels of abstraction, namely platform-independent and platform-specific models can be used in the software development process. Finally, we validate the proposed approach using a case study addressing the predictive maintenance of a hydraulics system with various networked sensors and actuators.

AB  - The Wiener process has provided lots of practically useful mathematical tools to model stochastic noise in many applications. However, this framework is not enough for modeling extremal events since many statistical properties of dynamical systems driven by Wiener processes are inevitably Gaussian. The goal of this work is to develop a framework that can represent heavy tailed distribution without losing the advantages of the Wiener process. To this end, we investigate models based on stable processes, and propose a method for stochastic linearization. It is applied to renewable energy assessment to show the effectiveness.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
M3  - Article
AB  - To cope with growing computing performance requirements, cyber-physical systems architectures are moving toward heterogeneous high-performance computer architectures and networks. Such architectures, however, incur intricate side effects that challenge traditional software design and integration. The programming paradigm can take a key role in mastering software design, as experience in automotive design demonstrates. To cope with the integration challenge, this industry has started introducing a programming paradigm that efficiently preserves application data flow under platform integration and changes with minimum performance loss. This article will revisit this paradigm that is currently used for lock-free multicore programming and explain its extension to the system level. It will then explore its application to two important developments in industrial design. This article will conclude with an evaluation of its properties, its overhead, and its application toward a robust design process.

AB  - Cyber physical systems are gaining more place in daily life so interaction with the machines are increasing. Hand gestures are one of the tools for interaction with the machines and human machines interfaces. Image processing, sensor based and sEMG based methods are the most popular for hand gesture recognition. sEMG based hand gesture recognition is chosen especially for graphical controller, hand rehabilitation software development and manipulation of robotic devices etc.In this study, classification of 5 hand motion, which are hand open, hand close, cylindrical grasp, Lateral pinch(key grasp) and index finger opening, have been realized. As a classifier, Artificial Neural Network(ANN) is used. The Data used for training and validation recorded from five subjects by using MYO (R) armband. Mean absolute value, slope sign change, waveform length, Willison amplitude and mean frequency features are used for classification. Classification performances were evaluated for all five subject together and each subject separately. In the study, we achieved 88.4 % mean classification rate by using five subject's recordings.

AB  - Normal fuzzy CMAC neural network performs well because of its fast learning speed and local generalization capability for approximating nonlinear functions. However, it requires huge memory and the dimension increases exponentially with the number of inputs. In this paper, we use recurrent technique to overcome these problems and propose a new CMAC neural network, named recurrent fuzzy CMAC (RFCMAC). Since the structure of RFCMAC is more complex, normal training methods are difficult to be applied. A new simple algorithm with a time-varying learning rate is proposed to assure the learning algorithm is stable.

TI  - I-Corps:  VeriSight CPS: Enhancing the Design and Operation of Cyber-Physical Systems with Verified Insight
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) tightly integrate computation with physical processes. Examples include modern automobiles, medical devices, toys, drones, robots, smart thermostat and HVAC systems and many more. The commercial potential of these systems has been recognized with the growing buzz around the "Internet of Things (IoT)." As the design of CPS/IoT systems goes mainstream, from a research, hobbyist, and niche industrial activity to a mainstream, large-scale industry, the design challenges are mounting. A primary challenge is to help designers and users gain better insight into their systems: what behaviors the systems must and must not have, why they exhibit certain desired/undesired behaviors, and how to design and implement them to achieve desired behavior. This project proposes to create a software toolkit, VeriSight CPS, and investigate its capabilities to meet this challenge. VeriSight can be used to answer queries about a system at various phases of the design and operation of a system. Industrial impact of the VeriSight toolkit is anticipated in several areas, including transportation, robotics, and medical devices.The technical goals of this project are to develop a software toolkit to assist in the specification, design, verification, debugging,optimization, and maintenance of cyber-physical systems, and to investigate its effectiveness in a focused set of applications of high impact. The underlying theory is a novel blend of formal methods for design automation and machine learning. Unlike mainstream machine learning and data analytics techniques, VeriSight CPS involves the use of verification technology to analyze models and to answer queries. The envisioned contributions of the project include a general software architecture for VeriSight CPS applicable to multiple application domains, the investigation of various user interaction models, and an exploration of industrial applications in key CPS domains including transportation, medical devices, and robotics. A key part of this Innovation Corps (I-Corps) project will be to interview potential customers, e.g., those from the categories listed above, and determine which options will be the most fruitful.

TI  - A Bayesian Optimization Method for Finding the Worst-Case Scenarios of Autonomous Vehicles
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Scenario-based testing has become a crucial method for certifying the safety of autonomous vehicles amidst the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology. The exploration of worst-case scenarios, which plays a vital role in safety assessments and accelerated improvements of autonomous driving systems, has posed challenges due to the high dimensionality of parameters and the uncertainty of the decisions of autonomous driving systems. To address these challenges, a Bayesian optimization framework was proposed herein as a solution. Surrogate models, including two Gaussian process-based and five non-Gaussian process-based models, are employed to replace part of the costly simulation models, to overcome the challenge of high dimensionality. The Jackknife and Bootstrap methods are used to estimate variance and calculate the acquisition function. Additionally, a differential evolutionary algorithm is employed to achieve efficient solutions while balancing exploration and exploitation, to overcome the challenge of output uncertainty. The proposed framework is validated through experimental results. It successfully identifies the worst-case scenarios in all three cases and the average number of tests for the optimal model in the most complex 9-dimensional scenario is less than 400. Notably, the approach using the Random Forest (RF) surrogate model achieves the highest search success rate in all three cases.

TI  - MoDALAS: addressing assurance for learning-enabled autonomous systems in the face of uncertainty
T2  - SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS MODELING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasingly, safety-critical systems include artificial intelligence and machine learning components (i.e., learning-enabled components (LECs)). However, when behavior is learned in a training environment that fails to fully capture real-world phenomena, the response of an LEC to untrained phenomena is uncertain and therefore cannot be assured as safe. Automated methods are needed for self-assessment and adaptation to decide when learned behavior can be trusted. This work introduces a model-driven approach to manage self-adaptation of a learning-enabled system (LES) to account for run-time contexts for which the learned behavior of LECs cannot be trusted. The resulting framework enables an LES to monitor and evaluate goal models at run time to determine whether or not LECs can be expected to meet functional objectives and enables system adaptation accordingly. Using this framework enables stakeholders to have more confidence that LECs are used only in contexts comparable to those validated at design time.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - In the Great Plains, there has been a recognized need for a systems modeling approach for sustainable agricultural research and development. Central to meeting the challenge of delivering viable decision support software, the USDA-ARS Great Plains Systems Research Unit (GPSRU), in a collaborative effort with Colorado State University (CSU), developed the Great Plains Framework for Agricultural Resource Management (GPFARM) DSS. The general purpose of GPFARM is to serve as a whole-farm/ranch DSS in strategic planning across the Great Plains. GPFARM runs on a field-by-field basis (with aggregation up to the whole-farm/ranch level), and provides production, economic and environmental impact analysis and site-specific database generation, from which alternative agricultural management systems can be tested and compared. Agricultural consultants and producers (both farmers and ranchers) were targeted as the primary users of GPFARM. User requirements were identified by an ARS customer focus group comprised of eastern Colorado farmers, ranchers, agricultural consultants, and NRCS and extension professionals. The GPFARM DSS is primarily composed of six major components: 1) a Microsoft(R) Windows-based graphical user interface; 2) Microsoft(R) Access databases containing soil, crop, weed, climate, equipment, chemical, and economic parameters; 3) an object-oriented modeling framework and science simulation model; 4) a stand-alone economic analysis tool; 5) a set of analysis tools including a multicriteria decision making module, an output visualization module, and summary report tables and graphs; and 6) a web-based information system. Thus, GPFARM is unique in that it brings together the above suite of decision support tools integrated across a whole-farm/ranch system.The idea for developing GPFARM was conceptualized in the late 1980's. Actual GPFARM development occurred from the early 1990's to 2003, ending with the current version 2.6. Despite a reasonable level of producer involvement in the requirements analysis, development, and evaluation phases of GPFARM, it can be argued that the rate of adoption has been slow compared with the rate predicted for it over a decade ago at development initiation. The successor to GPFARM (iFARM - integrated Farm and Ranch Management) is currently under development. Can we use our experiences from the GPFARM project to improve iFARM? In this paper, we first provide a brief overview of the GPFARM DSS. We then discuss the lessons learned (e. g., successes and failures) in over a decade of agricultural DSS development. A summary of conclusions resulting from discussion and critical analysis of the GPFARM project include:It is important that the DSS development process includes careful evaluation of the scope of the DSS in relation to the human and fiscal resources available (e. g., assessment of personnel available for developing, evaluating, implementing, and maintaining a DSS that matches the scope, scale, and complexity of the project). Formal project management and software engineering protocols and tools can aid in this regard.Careful attention to the intended target user group(s) is needed by: 1) matching the proposed technology appropriately with the user, and 2) gathering input from a broad spectrum of potential users when performing a requirements analysis.Simpler tools or database information generated from simulation analyses of alternative management options may have been more appropriate for delivery to producers and consultants at this stage in time.The capability to rapidly update major components (e. g., simulation model, databases) and address current questions or problems in the system is an absolute necessity - the GPSRU has recently developed an Object Modeling System (OMS) for this purpose. In addition, an appropriate compromise between scientific rigor and simplicity is essential for critical DSS components to ensure overall quality of the product (e. g., crop and forage simulation model response to environmental stresses; N and water balance response to management).

AB  - Modern society is increasingly surrounded by, and is growing accustomed to, a wide range of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet-of-Things (IoT), and smart devices. They often perform safety-critical functions, e.g., personal medical devices, automotive CPS as well as industrial and residential automation, e.g., sensor-alarm combinations. On the lower end of the scale, these devices are small, cheap and specialized sensors and/or actuators. They tend to host small anemic CPUs, have small amounts of memory and run simple software. If such devices are left unprotected, consequences of forged sensor readings or ignored actuation commands can be catastrophic, particularly, in safety-critical settings. This prompts the following three questions: (1) How to trust data produced, or verify that commands were performed, by a simple remote embedded device?, (2) How to bind these actions/results to the execution of expected software? and, (3) Can (1) and (2) be attained even if all software on a device can be modified and/or compromised?In this paper we answer these questions by designing, demonstrating security of, and formally verifying, APEX: an Architecture for Provable Execution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of its kind result for low-end embedded systems. Our work has a range of applications, especially, authenticated sensing and trustworthy actuation, which are increasingly relevant in the context of safety-critical systems. APEX is publicly available and our evaluation shows that it incurs low overhead, affordable even for very low-end embedded devices, e.g., those based on TI MSP430 or AVR ATmega processors.

AB  - This paper presents our experiences with a 120-person matrixed software engineering product team that successfully scaled adoption of Scrum across three countries. The product is a legacy, mission-critical software system that conforms to stringent healthcare regulatory standards We are practicing Obeya wall-A a large physical wall that visualize product information-that addresses our cross team communication challenges, Kudos cards-An event where people shows their gratitude cards publically for peers who deserve-that bonds team together and OYA day-A day event for team to do something 'Out of Your Area'-that helps fostering innovation, learning culture and collaboration. We are also describing our experience in defining focus areas of a project manager, test manager and that of a product manager. These roles are not defined in scrum guide, however, are relevant in our experience in a scaled up distributed scrum environment. The authors bring together experiences as a Scrum Master, a Product Owner, a Test Lead and an architect who have been an integral part of this journey, establishing these practices over several years. These practices have helped in scaling as well as stabilizing the team to an extent where each product version meets milestones on time and is taking strong steps towards shorter release cycles of quarterly releases. This paper also summaries our lessons learned, and recommendations.

TI  - Agent-based manufacturing - review and expert evaluation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The advent of smart manufacturing and the exposure to a new generation of technological enablers have revolutionized the way manufacturing process is carried out. Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) are introduced as main actors of this manufacturing shift. They are characterized for having high levels of communication, integration and computational capabilities that led them to a certain level of autonomy. Despite the high expectations and vision of CPPS, it still remains an exploratory topic. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been widely used by software engineers to solve traditional computing problems, e.g., banking transactions. Because of their high levels of distribution and autonomous capabilities, MAS have been considered by the research community as a good solution to design and implement CPPS. This work first introduces a collection of requirements and characteristics of smart manufacturing. A comprehensive review of various research applications is presented to understand the current state of the art and the application of agent technology in manufacturing. Considering the smart manufacturing requirements and current research application, a SWOT analysis was formulated which identifies pros and cons of the implementation of agents in industry. The SWOT analysis was further validated by an industrial expert evaluation and the main findings and discussion of the results are presented.

AB  - The Simplified Vehicle Operations paradigm seeks to achieve significant reductions in pilot workload and training requirements through the holistic design of flight control laws, control inceptors, and cockpit displays. This paper investigates the paradigm in the context of vertical takeoff and landing urban air mobility flight vehicle concepts using piloted flight simulations. Two inceptor layouts, one similar to conventional fixed-wing applications and the other similar to conventional rotorcraft, differing in the mapping of inputs to commanded flight states, were incorporated into two research flight simulators. A lift-plus-cruise aircraft simulation model featuring a Total Energy Control System based fly-by-wire flight control system architecture was used for both setups. Cockpit display elements were developed and deployed in an identical layout on both flight simulators. A limited number of participants, divided into three groups based on their prior piloting experience, were used to study pilot performance using representative handling qualities task elements.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The widespread adoption of cyber-physical systems in the safety-critical (hard real-time) domain is accompanied by a rising degree of code-reuse up to actual software product lines spanning different hardware platforms. Nevertheless, the dominant tools for static worst-case execution-time (WCET) analysis operate on individual, specific system instances at the binary level, further depending on machine-codeslevel annotations for precise analysis. Thus, this timing verification is neither portable nor reusable.PragMetis addresses this schism by providing an expressive source-level annotation language that enables to express context dependence at the library level using user-defined abstractions. These abstractions allow users to generically annotate context-dependent flow facts down to the granularity of individual loop contexts. We then use control-flows relation graphs to transfer these facts to machine-code level for specific instances, even in the presence of certain compiler optimizations, thus achieving portability. Our evaluation results based on TACLeBench confirm that PragMetis's powerful expressions yield more accurate WCET bounds.

TI  - Human-Cyber-Physical Ubiquitous Intelligent Communication: System Architecture, Key Technologies, and Challenges
T2  - IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The ternary-integration of human-cyber-physical (HCP) has the potential to enable beneficial applications. Intelligent communication is the key technology to ensure a deep ternary integration. However, existing communication schemes focus on facilitating dual integration and cannot be directly used for ternary integration due to the wider and increased dimensionality of the variability in terms of data type, wireless environment, and task requirement. To this end, we propose a human-cyber-physical ubiquitous intelligent communication system (HCP-UICS) by coupling the cross-modal information pre-processing module, intelligent transmission module, and multi-dimensional evaluation module to form a closed-loop system. This system is promising to cope with multi-dimensional variability throughout the communication process. To further activate the application potential of this system, we analyze and discuss its potential key technologies in terms of cross-modal information pre-processing, intelligent transmission, and multi-dimensional assessment. Specifically, to deal with the various data types, more complex transmission environments, and more diverse task requirements, we analyze the key challenges, provide partial solutions, and discuss insights of the HCP-UICS.

AB  - Over the last decades, automobiles have developed from predominantly mechanical machines to driving computers, consisting of a large number of sensors, actuators, and electronic control units that use various types of communication busses to form large and complex cyber-physical systems which provide a variety of comfort and safety features for the driver. Such E/E-systems (electric/electronic systems) do not only require high availability and reliability, but also overall efficient architectures and topologies. Because of the already high (and constantly increasing) level of complexity of such systems, the evaluation and optimization of their corresponding architectures has become a big challenge. The need for evaluation and optimization methods that are capable of abstracting the systems' complexity is evident for the automotive industry. In general, when it comes to designing and developing hard- and software systems, the paradigm of model-driven engineering emphasizes and supports the measures of abstraction, flexibility, and reusability to be able to grasp the complexity of modern systems. This paper presents a model-driven application for evaluating and optimizing automotive E/E-architectures as part of an integrated, model-based toolchain, developed with the Eclipse Modeling Framework.

CP  - 12th Interdisciplinary Information Management Talks Conference
CL  - Budweis, CZECH REPUBLIC
AB  - AMEISE is an environment for simulating software development based on an existing project simulator SESAM Students take the role of a project manager - they have to hire personnel with specific experience, assign tasks to the hired personnel, review progress and quality of work. AMEISE adds a powerful infrastructure around the existing simulator SESAM and provides an improved user interface, storage functionality, reporting/analysing features and much more. One further aspect of the A AMEISE project was the development of additional simulation models for the core-simulator. The field of software maintenance, often in teaching and research underrepresented, was chosen and a maintenance model way developed at the Institute for Systems Engineering and Automation.This paper outlines the concepts behind the developed maintenance model and especially takes into account teaching aspects of the maintenance model by describing the learning objectives underlying the maintenance model and providing a first experience report from the use of the AMEISE maintenance model in teaching.

AB  - It is impossible in practice to comprehensively test even small software programs due to the vastness of the reachable state space; however, modern cyber-physical systems such as aircraft require a high degree of confidence in software safety and reliability. Here we explore methods of generating test sets to effectively and efficiently explore the state space for a module based on the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) used on commercial aircraft. A formal model of TCAS in the model-checking language NuSMV provides an output oracle. We compare test sets generated using various methods, including covering arrays, random, and a low-complexity input paradigm applied to 28 versions of the TCAS C program containing seeded errors. Faults are triggered by tests for all 28 programs using a combination of covering arrays and random input generation. Complexity-based inputs perform more efficiently than covering arrays, and can be paired with random input generation to create efficient and effective test sets. A random forest classifier identifies variable values that can be targeted to generate tests even more efficiently in future work, by combining a machine-learned fuzzing algorithm with more complex model oracles developed in model-based systems engineering (MBSE) software.

TI  - (Re)deployment of Smart Algorithms in Cyber-Physical Production Systems Using DSL4hDNCS
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
M3  - Article
AB  - Intelligent algorithms and learning are the basis for evolving smart cyber-physical production systems (CPPSs) and Industrie 4.0. A smart image detection algorithm shall be added to reduce downtime due to the extended operation of glass bottles in a yogurt producing plant. To support the engineers in doing so, a comprehensive domain-specific language (DSL), DSL4hDNCS, is introduced, enabling rapid analysis, addressing hardware/software architectures and network-related delays and uncertainties. DSL4hDNCS is defined by a metamodel to avoid ambiguity and enriched by aspects, such as safety, calculation power, and network transmission time. DSL4hDNCS is used to compare (re)deployment alternatives using different technologies, such as edge, fog, and cloud to implement the additional smart algorithm. The evaluation of DSL4hDNCS using an acknowledged Industrie 4.0 demonstrator plant as a case study confirmed the benefit for engineers during the redesign.

AB  - Deep learning techniques have been successfully used for pattern classification. These advantage methods are still not applied in nonlinear systems identification. In this paper, the neural model has deep architecture which is obtained by a random search method. The initial weights of this deep neural model is obtained from the denoising autoencoders model. We propose special unsupervised learning methods for this deep learning model with input data. The normal supervised learning is used to train the weights with the output data. The deep learning identification algorithms are validated with three benchmark examples.

TI  - A model-based approach for self-adaptive security in CPS: Application to smart grids
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Security risk assessment is an important challenge in the design of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). Even more importantly, the intrinsically dynamical nature of these systems, due to changes in their environment, as well as evolutions in their infrastructures, makes them self-adaptive systems, where security aspects have to be considered in terms of management of detections and reactions for self-protection. In this work, we propose an approach to autonomously mitigate the threats in each reconfiguration at application or infrastructure levels of CPS. We propose and implement a framework for self-adaptive security: software architecture, design method, and integration with model-based decision. We use Attack-Defense Trees for modeling threats, and our approach involves security risk assessment, taking into account its balancing and coordination with qualityof-service aspects. We formulate and formalize the on -line decision problem to be solved at each cycle of the self-adaptation control loop in terms of Constraint Programming (CP) modeling and resolution. The CP model implements a set of constraints that allow to specify secure configurations, evaluated regarding their impact on system performance to pinpoint the most relevant one portraying a good balance between the security and quality of service. We perform validation of our approach with its application to Smart Grids, more particularly to an industrial case study from RTE (the French Energy Transmission company).

TI  - Open-Source Implementations of the Reactive Asset Administration Shell: A Survey
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of open-source software is crucial for the digitalization of manufacturing, including the implementation of Digital Twins as envisioned in Industry 4.0. This research paper provides a comprehensive comparison of free and open-source implementations of the reactive Asset Administration Shell (AAS) for creating Digital Twins. A structured search on GitHub and Google Scholar was conducted, leading to the selection of four implementations for detailed analysis. Objective evaluation criteria were defined, and a testing framework was created to test support for the most common AAS model elements and API calls. The results show that all implementations support at least a minimal set of required features while none implement the specification in all details, which highlights the challenges of implementing the AAS specification and the incompatibility between different implementations. This paper is therefore the first attempt at a comprehensive comparison of AAS implementations and identifies potential areas for improvement in future implementations. It also provides valuable insights for software developers and researchers in the field of AAS-based Digital Twins.

AB  - This article proposes an agent-based policy simulation framework that can be applied to the cases satisfying: 1) the agents try to maximize some intertemporal preference and 2) the impacts of different factors on agents' behavioral tendency are monotonic. By combining the simulation and optimization methods, this framework balances the flexibility and validity of agent-based models (ABMs): the sigmoid function is modified and used to model agents' decision-making rules, and the evolutionary training method is used to calibrate agents' behavioral parameters. Based on an example for the emission trading scheme, the application of the framework is presented and evaluated in detail.

TI  - Thermal Management System Modeling and Simulation of a Full-Powered Fuel Cell Vehicle
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal management is an important factor in securing the safe and effective operation of a fuel cell vehicle (FCV). A parameterized stack model of a 100 kW proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is constructed by matlab/Simulink to design and asses the thermal management characteristics of a 100 kW full-powered FCV. The cooling components model, with parameters obtained by theoretical calculation based on the cooling requirement, is developed in the commercial solver GT-COOL. A thermal management simulation platform is constructed by coupling the stack model and cooling components. The accuracy of the modeling method for the stack is validated by comparing with the experimental data. The relationship between the operating temperature and output performance of the fuel cell stack is revealed based on the simulation model. The simulation results show that the operating temperature has a considerable influence on stack performance under high-current operation, and the inlet and outlet temperatures of the stack change nearly linearly with the increasing environmental temperature. The heat dissipation potential of the thermal management system under the high-load condition is also verified. The temperatures and coolant flow of core components, including the stack, DC/DC, air compressor, and driving motor, can meet the cooling requirements.

AB  - Air quality and fuel efficiency has become important factors in decision-makings on urban traffic planning and management. To support the process simulation models have potential to play essential roles in evaluation of planning alternatives and control strategies. However, traffic and its environmental impacts are different processes and often require various levels of models. With concerns on high computing performance and rich functionalities, it may be not appropriate to model emission inventory within traffic simulation. In this paper, we present a distributed simulation approach, and an independent emission/energy computing platform is built to simulate, visualize and analyze online emission outputs, given a microscopic traffic simulation tool, KTH-TPMA. Two distributed computing frameworks, common objects request broker architecture (CORBA) and service oriented architecture (SOA), are adopted in the distributed software design and implementation. Several emission models are implemented and generally evaluated in microsimulation runs of two road networks.

TI  - A comparison of fog and cloud computing cyber-physical interfaces for Industry 4.0 real-time embedded machine learning engineering applications
T2  - COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrial cyber-physical systems are the primary enabling technology for Industry 4.0, which combine legacy industrial and control engineering, with emerging technology paradigms (e.g. big data, internetof-things, artificial intelligence, and machine learning), to derive self-aware and self-configuring factories capable of delivering major production innovations. However, the technologies and architectures needed to connect and extend physical factory operations to the cyber world have not been fully resolved. Although cloud computing and service-oriented architectures demonstrate strong adoption, such implementations are commonly produced using information technology perspectives, which can overlook engineering, control and Industry 4.0 design concerns relating to real-time performance, reliability or resilience. Hence, this research compares the latency and reliability performance of cyber-physical interfaces implemented using traditional cloud computing (i.e. centralised), and emerging fog computing (i.e. decentralised) paradigms, to deliver real-time embedded machine learning engineering applications for Industry 4.0. The findings highlight that despite the cloud's highly scalable processing capacity, the fog's decentralised, localised and autonomous topology may provide greater consistency, reliability, privacy and security for Industry 4.0 engineering applications, with the difference in observed maximum latency ranging from 67.7%-99.4%. In addition, communication failures rates highlighted differences in both consistency and reliability, with the fog interface successfully responding to 900,000 communication requests (i.e. 0% failure rate), and the cloud interface recording failure rates of 0.11%, 1.42%, and 6.6% under varying levels of stress.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to propose a reliable multiple-choice or multiple-response assessment generation procedure. A question of the assessment passing threshold selection is considered. The study uses simulation for the test outcomes distribution evaluation which is used for the assessment passing threshold calculation. The relation between the number of answers and distractors in a task and assessment reliability is shown. The reliable assessment generation procedure based on simulation and statistics is proposed. The web application for students testing purposes based on the proposed approach is implemented. The proposed method can be used for online studying as well as offline ones.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th International Symposium on Leveraging Applications of Formal Methods, Verification and Validation
CL  - Rodos, GREECE
AB  - Based upon first-order logic, the paper presents a methodology and a deductive system for proving compositionality. Typical specifications found in industry are not expressed in any formal notation; rather most often in natural language. Therefore, the methodology does not assume specifications to be formal logical sentences. Instead, the methodology takes as input, properties of specifications and in particular, refinement relations. To cover general industrial heterogeneous systems, the semantics chosen is behavior based, originating in previous work on contract-based design for cyber-physical systems. In contrast to the previous work, implementation of specifications is non-monotonic with respect to composition. That is, even though a specification is implemented by one component, a composition with a second component may not implement the same specification. This kind of non-monotonicity is fundamentally important to support architectural specifications and so-called freedom-of-interference used in design of safety critical systems.

AB  - An improved radial basis function neural network (IRBFNN) with unsymmetrical Gaussian function is presented to simplify the structure of RBFNN. The improved resource allocating network (IRAN) is developed to design IRBFNN online for nonlinear dynamic system modeling, integrating the typical resource allocating network (RAN) with merging method for similar hidden units, deleting strategy for redundant hidden units, and LMS learning algorithm with moving data window for output link weights of network. The proposed approach can effectively improve the precision and generalization of IRBFNN. The combination of IRBFNN and IRAN is competent for the online modeling of nonlinear dynamic systems. The feasibility and effectiveness of the modeling method have been demonstrated by simulations.

AB  - Component Fault Trees (CFTs) were invented in 2003 as a compositional extension to fault trees to better reflect the technical architecture of a system in its safety analysis model. Since then, a lot of research has been contributed regarding semantic extensions, evaluation techniques, and tighter linking between system and safety models. This paper addresses three main objectives. First, we summarize the most important contributions and shape a vision of better integrated system modeling and safety analysis. Second, we push forward standardization and sketch a new evaluation scheme for quantitative analysis using mdd. Lastly, an outlook on future improvement ideas is given to make CFTs a viable technique for loosely coupled systems and Cyber-Physical Systems.

AB  - Flight simulator is a complex man-in-the-loop (MIL) simulation system. With several decades of development, it has already become important tools of aircraft design and development, and necessary means of pilot training. And simulation credibility and reliability of the flight simulator have been considerably improved in comparison with the past. However, the system of flight simulator has become increasingly complex and difficult to be described clearly. This paper presents the concepts of conceptual layer and achieving layer, analyzes the composition and principle of the commercial aircraft flight simulator for pilot training from the two layers, describes the system architecture in detail. According to the system architecture, three aspects are very important to develop the flight simulator, the first is the fidelity of the simulation models, the second is the performance of cueing devices, and the last are the computing capacity of the host computers and the time delay over the communication networks.

TI  - Federated Learning-Based Secure Electronic Health Record Sharing Scheme in Medical Informatics
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Medical Cyber-Physical Systems support the mobility of electronic health records data for clinical research to accelerate new scientific discoveries. Artificial Intelligence improves medical informatics, but current centralized data training and insecure data storage management techniques expose private medical data to unauthorized foreign entities. In this paper, a Federated Learning-based Electronic Health Record sharing scheme is proposed for Medical Informatics to preserve patient data privacy. A decentralized Federated Learning-based Convolutional Neural Network model trains data locally in the hospital and stores results in a private InterPlanetary File System. A secondary global model is trained at the research center using the local models. Private IPFS secures all medical data stored locally in the hospital. The novelty of this study resides in securing valuable hospital biomedical data useful for clinical research organizations. Blockchain and smart contracts enable patients to negotiate with external entities for rewards in exchange for their data. Evaluation results demonstrate that the decentralized CNN model performs better in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, similar to the traditional centralized model. The performance of the Private IPFS exceeds the Blockchain-based IPFS based on file upload and download time. The scheme is suitable for promoting a secure and privacy-friendly environment for sharing data with clinical research centers for biomedical research.

TI  - DTRON: a tool for distributed model-based testing of time critical applications
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ESTONIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) present the greatest challenges but also the greatest opportunities in several critical industrial segments such as electronics, automotive and industrial automation. Governing the complexity and design correctness issues of CPS software requires methodologies and tools that address the problems of intrinsic concurrency and timing constraints over a large spectrum of CPS architectures. In this paper we present DTRON, a framework for model-based testing that addresses the issues of distributed execution and real-time constraints imposed by the design of networked CPS. DTRON extends the Uppaal model checking tool and online test execution tool TRON enabling coordination, synchronization, and online distributed testing. The notion of Delta-testability required to guarantee the controllability of distributed tests is one of the main design considerations for DTRON. The core part of the paper presents the architectural solutions for implementing DTRON and then special focus is put on the performance evaluation of the tool taking into account the communication and test adapter delays in networked systems. We demonstrate that the co-use of Spread message serialization service and Network Time Protocol allows reducing. down to the 1 ms range, which is sufficient for testing timing properties of a substantial class of networked CPS. We exemplify the applicability of DTRON with three distributed testing case studies, namely, city street light controller network, interbank trading system, and robot navigation system.

AB  - Today's world is witnessing a shift from human-written software to machine-learned software, with the rise of systems that rely on machine learning. These systems typically operate in non-static environments, which are prone to unexpected changes, as is the case of self-driving cars and enterprise systems. In this context, machine-learned software can misbehave. Thus, it is paramount that these systems are capable of detecting problems with their machined-learned components and adapting themselves to maintain desired qualities. For instance, a fraud detection system that cannot adapt its machine-learned model to efficiently cope with emerging fraud patterns or changes in the volume of transactions is subject to losses of millions of dollars. In this paper, we take a first step towards the development of a framework for self-adaptation of systems that rely on machine-learned components. We describe: (i) a set of causes of machine-learned component misbehavior and a set of adaptation tactics inspired by the literature on machine learning, motivating them with the aid of two running examples from the enterprise systems and cyber-physical systems domains; (ii) the required changes to the MAPE-K loop, a popular control loop for self-adaptive systems; and (iii) the challenges associated with developing this framework. We conclude with a set of research questions to guide future work.

TI  - Towards Automatically Reverse Engineering Vehicle Diagnostic Protocols

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 31st USENIX Security Symposium
CL  - Boston, MA
AB  - In-vehicle protocols are very important to the security assessment and protection of modern vehicles since they are used in communicating with, accessing, and even manipulating ECUs (Electronic Control Units) that control various vehicle components. Unfortunately, the majority of in-vehicle protocols are proprietary without publicly available documents. Although recent studies proposed methods to reverse engineer the CAN protocol used in the communication among ECUs, they cannot be applied to vehicle diagnostics protocols, which have been widely exploited by attackers to launch remote attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for automatically reverse engineering the diagnostic protocols of vehicles by leveraging professional diagnostic tools. Specifically, we design and develop a new cyber-physical system that uses a set of algorithms to control a programmable robotics arm with the aid of cameras to automatically trigger and capture the messages of diagnostics protocols as well as reverse engineer their formats, semantic meanings, and proprietary formulas required for processing the response messages. We perform a large-scale experiment to evaluate our prototype using 18 real vehicles. It successfully reverse engineers 570 messages (446 for reading sensor values and 124 for controlling components). The experimental results show that our framework achieves high precision in reverse engineering proprietary formulas and obtains much more messages than the prior approach based on app analysis.

TI  - Some Seeds Are Strong: Seeding Strategies for Search-based Test Case Selection
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The time it takes software systems to be tested is usually long. Search-based test selection has been a widely investigated technique to optimize the testing process. In this article, we propose a set of seeding strategies for the test case selection problem that generates the initial population of Pareto-based multi-objective algorithms, with the goals of (1) helping to find an overall better set of solutions and (2) enhancing the convergence of the algorithms. The seeding strategies were integrated with four state-of-the-art multi-objective search algorithms and applied into two contexts where regression-testing is paramount: (1) Simulation-based testing of Cyber-physical Systems and (2) Continuous Integration. For the first context, we evaluated our approach by using six fitness function combinations and six independent case studies, whereas in the second context, we derived a total of six fitness function combinations and employed four case studies. Our evaluation suggests that some of the proposed seeding strategies are indeed helpful for solving the multi-objective test case selection problem. Specifically, the proposed seeding strategies provided a higher convergence of the algorithms towards optimal solutions in 96% of the studied scenarios and an overall cost-effectiveness with a standard search budget in 85% of the studied scenarios.

TI  - DEVS-based Methodological Framework for Multi-Quality Attribute Evaluation using Software Architectures
T2  - 2017 XLIII LATIN AMERICAN COMPUTER CONFERENCE (CLEI)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 43rd Latin American Computer Conference (CLEI)
CL  - Cordoba, ARGENTINA
AB  - Simulation is a powerful tool to evaluate quality attributes of complex software systems, but it is not the most comfortable environment for software engineers. They usually use to specify software architectures graphical notations like Use Case Map (UCM). This paper presents a methodological framework to apply DEVS to the software architecture evaluation problem. This framework is organized in two parts: frontend and backend. The frontend allows engineers to specify software architectures with UCM. The backend uses Discrete Event System Specification formalism (DEVS) to model and simulate the specified architectures. The proposal defines required elements following the Model-driven Development to transform UCMs into domain-specific DEVS models. Engineers can formulate UCMs and generate the corresponding simulation models to evaluate several quality attributes together with the system functionality. This methodology guides developers to a dynamic multi-attribute assessment under different usage profiles, whose results can be used for making early decisions to reduce development and maintenance costs.

T2  - SHIPS AND OFFSHORE STRUCTURES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study presents the design and development of a hybrid simulation system of a two-stroke engine for marine engineers training. The paper outlines the technical approach, system architecture, key principles, and simulation models. A marine engine load test was performed to evaluate the accuracy and functionality of the system. Results indicate that the maximum percentage error in simulated engine performance is under 3.5%. The heat exchange model effectively describes heat transfer within the main engine and cooling systems. The system simulates engine operation under both normal and degraded conditions, including scenarios like clogged fuel injector nozzles. The findings show that changes in cylinder pressure, output power, exhaust gas temperature, and coolant temperature correspond closely with expected outcomes of real faults. This research offers valuable insights for developing similar large-scale hybrid simulation systems in electromechanical fields.

AB  - Models in environmental hydrological simulation and research are widely accepted for supporting the decision process in landscape planning management. In contrast to special purpose models with limited universal application, modeling systems became popular, Such systems use a component-oriented approach in terms of their capability of constructing a model from a set of library components residing in a (hydrological) modeling library. Our efforts in modeling system development are tending to introduce the Java architecture as the basic architecture for such modeling systems in simulations. The object modeling system (OMS) is characterized by a pure object-oriented architecture on the top of the Java virtual machine in terms of the fundamental interaction principle of the modeling objects, which is close to the design of pure object-oriented systems and languages, This paper introduces a modeling system architecture for interactive-oriented development of hydrological simulation models, where scenario variation in simulation (data and algorithm variability) is possible as well as execution performance, (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

CP  - 7th Brazilian Symposium on Computing Systems Engineering (SBESC)
CL  - Curitiba, BRAZIL
AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are known to be highly complex systems which can be applied to a variety of different environments, covering both civil and military application domains. As CPS are typically complex systems, its design process requires strong guarantees that the specified functional and nonfunctional properties are satisfied on the designed application. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and high-level specification languages are a valuable asset to help the design and evaluation of such complex systems. However, when looking at the existing MDE tool-support, it is observed that there is still little support for the automated integration of formal verification techniques in these tools. Given that formal verification is necessary to ensure the levels of reliability required by safety critical CPS, this paper presents an approach that aims to integrate the Model Checking technique in the CPS design process for the purpose of correctly analyzing temporal and safety characteristics. A tool named ECPS Verifier was designed to support the model checking integration into the design process, providing the generation of timed automata models from high-levels specifications in AADL. The proposed method is illustrated by means of the design of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, from where we derive the timed automata models to be analyzed in the UPPAAL tool.

AB  - In runtime verification, manually formalizing a specification for monitoring system executions is a tedious and error-prone process. To address this issue, we consider the problem of automatically synthesizing formal specifications from system executions. To demonstrate our approach, we consider the popular specification language Metric Temporal Logic (MTL), which is particularly tailored towards specifying temporal properties for cyber-physical systems (CPS). Most of the classical approaches for synthesizing temporal logic formulas aim at minimizing the size of the formula. However, for efficiency in monitoring, along with the size, the amount of "lookahead" required for the specification becomes relevant, especially for safety-critical applications. We formalize this notion and devise a learning algorithm that synthesizes concise formulas having bounded lookahead. Our learning algorithm reduces the synthesis task to a series of satisfiability problems in Linear Real Arithmetic (LRA) and generates MTL formulas from their satisfying assignments. The reduction uses a novel encoding of a popular MTL monitoring procedure using LRA. Finally, we implement our algorithm in a tool called TEAL and demonstrate its ability to synthesize efficiently monitorable MTL formulas in CPS applications.

AB  - Top-down decomposition of a complex system of systems (SoS) requires representation of the behavior of multiple individuals and cyber-physical systems performing a wide variety of tasks, usually at different times and with different goals. In the future, as humans and machines learn and co-adapt in their mission context, systems engineering must develop approaches that support dynamic analysis and synthesis in both the design and operation of systems. The concept of a "digital (mission) twin" provides an integration framework for design and control of future complex cyberphysical-human SoS. The framework builds on mission function task (MFT) analysis, providing a basis for modelbased systems engineering (MBSE) activities to identify and address needs for automation or other forms of advanced technology that improve overall system performance. However, human-driven adaptation and eventually machine adaptation of complex SoS poses organizational and methodological challenges. We discuss the need for and opportunities for convergence of three often segregated SE methodologies: product engineering, human systems integration, and mission/operations analysis by expanding the product or process engineering view of a digital twin to the mission level. In the present this gives us a framework to analyze and specify automation and adaptation opportunities at the mission level. In the future we envision this twin continuously operates with the real systems to manage both emergent mission conditions and lifecycle adaptation. We applied this framework to a complex military mission using a case where artificial intelligence can be incorporated widely across a set of mission tasks to significantly improve performance.

AB  - Companies developing and maintaining software-only products like web shops aim for establishing persistent links to their software running in the field. Monitoring data from real usage scenarios allows for a number of improvements in the software life-cycle, such as quick identification and solution of issues, and elicitation of requirements from previously unexpected usage. While the processes of continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous experimentation using sandboxing technologies are becoming well established in said software-only products, adopting similar practices for the automotive domain is more complex mainly due to real-time and safety constraints. In this paper, we systematically evaluate sandboxed software deployment in the context of a self-driving heavy vehicle that participated in the 2016 Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge (GCDC) in The Netherlands. We measured the system's scheduling precision after deploying applications in four different execution environments. Our results indicate that there is no significant difference in performance and overhead when sandboxed environments are used compared to natively deployed software. Thus, recent trends in software architecting, packaging, and maintenance using microservices encapsulated in sandboxes will help to realize similar software and system engineering for cyber-physical systems.

T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyber-physical Systems of Systems (SoSs) are large-scale systems made of independent and autonomous cyber-physical Constituent Systems (CSs) which may interoperate to achieve high-level goals also with the intervention of humans. Providing security in such SoSs means, among other features, forecasting and anticipating evolving SoS functionalities, ultimately identifying possible detrimental phenomena that may result from the interactions of CSs and humans. Such phenomena, usually called emergent phenomena, are often complex and difficult to capture: the first appearance of an emergent phenomenon in a cyber-physical SoS is often a surprise to the observers. Adequate support to understand emergent phenomena will assist in reducing both the likelihood of design or operational flaws, and the time needed to analyze the relations amongst the CSs, which always has a key economic significance. This article presents a threat analysis methodology and a supporting tool aimed at (i) identifying (emerging) threats in evolving SoSs, (ii) reducing the cognitive load required to understand an SoS and the relations among CSs, and (iii) facilitating SoS risk management by proposing mitigation strategies for SoS administrators. The proposed methodology, as well as the tool, is empirically validated on Smart Grid case studies by submitting questionnaires to a user base composed of 3 stakeholders and 18 BSc and MSc students.

AB  - We present a methodology for the probabilistic modeling of failure dependencies in large, complex systems using Markov Logic Networks (MLNs), a state-of-the-art probabilistic relational modeling technique in machine learning. We illustrate this modeling methodology on example system architectures, and show how the the Probabilistic Consistency Engine (PCE) tool can create and analyze failure-dependency models. We compare MLN-based analysis with analytical symbolic analysis to validate our approach. The latter method yields bounds on the expected system behaviors for different component-failure probabilities, but it requires closed-form representations and is therefore often an impractical approach for complex system analysis. The MLN-based method facilitates techniques of early design analysis for reliability (e.g., probabilistic sensitivity analysis). We analyze two examples - a portion of the Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTEthernet) communication platform used in space, and an architecture based on Honeywell's Cabin Air Compressor (CAC) - that highlight the value of the MLN-based approach for analyzing failure dependencies in complex cyber-physical systems.

TI  - A Tablet-Based Surrogate System Architecture for "In-Situ" Evaluation of Cyber-Physical Transport Technologies
T2  - IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MAGAZINE
M3  - Article
AB  - As advanced intelligent transportation systems become more prevalent with the use of cyber-physical systems, information and communications technologies, and Big Data, there is an increasing need to improve the process of technology evaluation. Existing procedures typically involve pure computer simulations followed by expensive and restricted field studies. We propose a more integrated solution: using mobile devices to mimic the algorithms within actual technologies so that advanced technological design alternatives can be cheaply evaluated on the field. A process architecture is developed for a tablet-based cyber-physical surrogate system. The tablet devices can mimic many equipment packages and can transmit data, location, text, and video between themselves and a central facility. Measures of effectiveness are identified for evaluating these surrogate systems in field trials. Three surrogate systems are implemented as field experiments conducted on the Ryerson University campus in Toronto, ON. The experiments' measures of effectiveness are deviation from a schedule, total process time, and person counts-applicable to many real world transportation problems. The experiments demonstrate how we can quantitatively measure these technologies from the field: an average improvement of 64% in cumulative schedule deviation for the "Uniform Arrivals" experiment, 27% in the total process time for the "Scavenger Hunt" experiment, but a poor mimic error when evaluating the LIVEGAUGE stationary sensor. An open-source online repository for these surrogate systems is created and discussed.

AB  - The System Modeling Analysis and Research Tool (SMART) model is a tool to support the performance evaluation process. It was determined that it was necessary to have a tool that could predict the performance impact, on the system level, of various hardware and software changes, additions, or enhancements. Therefore, an effort was undertaken to create a system model of the PC Server environment. The SMART model is the result of this effort.The initial version of the SMART model was a simulation model of a PS/2* with a Direct Access Storage Device (DASD) Subsystem running OS/2*. The purpose of this project was to create a tool that would predict the performance of various DASD subsystems on PS/2 platforms. The SMART model was developed to achieve this purpose. To ensure that the model depicted actual hardware and software the debugged model was validated against measurements taken on a PS/2 system running OS/2.

TI  - A frame-work to integrate software behavior into dynamic probabilistic risk assessment

AB  - Software plays an increasingly important role in modern safety-critical systems. Although, research has been done to integrate software into the classical probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) framework, current PRA practice overwhelmingly neglects the contribution of software to system risk. Dynamic probabilistic risk assessment (DPRA) is considered to be the next generation of PRA techniques. DPRA is a set of methods and techniques in which simulation models that represent the behavior of the elements of a system are exercised in order to identify risks and vulnerabilities of the system. The fact remains, however, that modeling software for use in the DPRA framework is also quite complex and very little has been done to address the question directly and comprehensively. This paper develops a methodology to integrate software contributions in the DPRA environment. The framework includes a software representation, and an approach to incorporate the software representation into the DPRA environment SimPRA. The software representation is based on multi-level objects and the paper also proposes a framework to simulate the multi-level objects in the simulation-based DPRA environment. This is a new methodology to address the state explosion problem in the DPRA environment. This study is the first systematic effort to integrate software risk contributions into DPRA environments.

CPSWeek is an annual international multi-conference for Cyber-Physical Systems, comprising five major multi-day conferences, five one-day workshops, and four one-day tutorials. It moves from country to country each year. Attending the conference will provide students with a unique opportunity to listen and learn from the keynote speeches, presentations, posters and demos on cutting edge topics on cyber-physical systems, and to network with both leaders and other young researchers in this area. CPS research is expected to have positive societal impacts in many areas, including transportation, energy, agriculture, water/sewage treatment, environmental management and manufacturing systems. These systems must operate safely, dependably, securely, efficiently and respond to events in real time. A key feature of CPS research is the requirement to cooperate across disciplines such as computer science, computer architecture and hardware, material science and sensor design, software engineering, networking, and control engineering. In this inherently interdisciplinary field, where collaborations are essential, meeting other researchers is especially important. This event is especially valuable in this regard, because of the international exposure. There is a very high level of activity and investment in CPS research outside the US including Europe and Asia. For these reasons, strong participation in this event, especially among students (our next generation of researchers) is important to maintaining and advancing CPS research in the US.

AB  - This paper presents the Autosim Process Improvement Experiment, ESSI project n. 27585.The company produces embedded software for factory automation systems. The software integration phase in factory has always been a delicate phase for each project, as the number of faults found and to be fixed in that phase is unpredictable.Autosim aims at introducing in-house test of embedded software based on the simulation of its environment in the production facility. The software process is enriched of two new phases, definition of simulation models of the factory, and in house test of the embedded software against the models. It is expected that these new activities will allow to find most integration faults in house, where they can be fixed easily and at lower cost. Therefore integration in factory should become predictable, with shorter duration and effort.

AB  - The energy and timing behaviour of embedded components such as radio chips or sensors plays an important role when developing energy-efficient cyber-physical systems and IoT devices. However, datasheet values generally have low accuracy and may be incomplete, and performing new energy measurements after each code or hardware configuration change is time-consuming. While energy models - automatically generated from benchmarks exercising all relevant device configurations - offer a solution, they should have both low prediction error and low complexity in order to be useful to humans as well as energy simulations. With today's increasingly complex devices and drivers, generating compact and accurate energy models is becoming harder due to non-linear effects and interdependencies between configuration parameters. To address this issue, we present Regression Model Trees. By combining software product line engineering and energy modeling methodologies, these are capable of automatically learning complex energy models from benchmark data. Using energy and timing benchmarks on two embedded radio chips and an air quality sensor, we show that Regression Model Trees are both more accurate than conventional energy models and less complex than state-of-the-art approaches from the product line engineering community. Thus, they are easier to understand and use for humans and algorithms alike. We observe two- to 100-fold complexity reduction, and a maximum energy model error of 6% with cross-validation.

TI  - Design and experimental analysis of a carbon dioxide transcritical chiller for commercial refrigeration
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon dioxide is an interesting solution for commercial refrigeration and in perspective for air-conditioning systems. In this paper a newly developed carbon dioxide transcritical air cooled chiller for refrigerating propylene glycol down to -8 degrees C supply temperature is described. The aim of the project was at optimising the cycle energy efficiency while assuring reliable operation and simple management of the unit. The carbon dioxide optimal pressure issue is addressed with an innovate system architecture and control logic. Using a flash tanks and two electronic valves, the optimal cycle upper pressure was maintained in transcritical operation mode. The managing of the valves allows the refrigeration machine efficiency improvement when the gas cooler inlet air allows subcritical working conditions. A simulation model of the chiller was developed and its results validated with experimental data. A measurement campaign was carried out, testing the chiller at external temperatures ranging from 18 to 35 degrees C. the unit energy efficiency ranging from 3.1 to 2.0. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Tackling visual and conceptual complexity of problem-oriented modeling of requirements
T2  - SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the contemporary age of cyber-physical systems (CPS), where software governs the control, coordination, and management of physical objects to tackle real-world problems, engineering requirements for such systems present considerable challenges. Consequently, it is not surprising that the requirements engineering (RE) community, encompassing both academia and industry, has turned to established RE methodologies and applied them within the context of CPS; notably, Jackson's Problem Frames (PF) approach deploys problem diagrams for modeling CPS. However, problem diagrams of realistic CPS often present visual and conceptual complexities, which must be addressed before PF can be usefully applied in practice. In this paper, the above problem is addressed in two steps: firstly, preliminary findings are presented by deriving from the application of eye-tracking software in the assessment of a technique designed to mitigate the visual complexity inherent in the CARE (Computer-Aided Requirements Engineering) tool developed for PF. An auto-layout technique is developed for detecting and resolving overlaps, aimed at enhancing its usability from the perspectives of cognition, psychology, and user studies; secondly, the technique of a complexity matrix is applied for calculating and evaluating the conceptual complexity inherent in problem diagrams. Our eye-tracking results show the successful implementation of overlap detection and resolution. The case studies in the second step also demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the complexity matrix calculations.

AB  - The grid of the future will have a higher penetration of grid edge devices that enable increased automation and grid edge intelligence. The current grid models do not account for these grid-edge devices, and the creation of cyber-physical models for the grid is essential to understand the impact of these devices. Although existing cyber-physical power system (CPPS) models have been developed using a wide variety of approaches, a comprehensive review of the validity of these approaches and their suitability for modeling the future grid has not been performed. In a CPPS, the physical layer usually consists of the power grid and protection devices, whereas the cyber layer consists of communication, computation, and control components. This paper provides a review on the existing approaches to model CPPS and to characterize the inter- and intra-actions for distributed autonomous systems. The CPPS models can then be used to perform various analyses, such as cyberattack analysis, threat analysis, and resilience analysis. A qualitative evaluation criteria for the various modeling paradigm is discussed to help researchers understand the trade-offs in choosing the right modeling method for their particular application.

TI  - Dynamic Simulation Model and Experimental Validation of One Passive Fuel Cell-Battery Hybrid Powertrain for an Electric Light Scooter
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the escalating issue of climate change, environmental protection is of growing importance. A rising proportion of battery-powered scooters are becoming available. However, their range is limited, and they require a long charging time. The fuel cell-battery-powered electric scooter appears to be a promising alternative. Further development of the active hybrid is the passive hybrid, in which the fuel cell is directly coupled to the battery, eliminating the need for a DC/DC converter. The passive hybrid promises the possibility of a reduction in the installation volume and cost. A simulation model is created MATLAB/Simulink for the passive fuel cell-battery hybrid electric scooter. It specifically focuses on how the power split between the fuel cell and battery occurs under dynamic load requirements. The scooter is powered by two air-hydrogen Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) systems with a nominal power of 250W each and a Li-ion battery (48 V, 12 Ah). The validation is performed following an ECE-R47 driving cycle. The maximum relative deviation of the fuel cell is 2.82% for the current value. The results of the simulation show a high level of agreement with the test data. This study provides a method allowing for an efficient assessment of the passive fuel cell-battery hybrid electric scooter.

TI  - Performance evaluation from stochastic statecharts representation of flexible reactive systems: a simulation approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on the performance analysis of flexible reactive systems. The performance analysis consists of two phases: first system modeling, second performance evaluation. The paper models the flexible reactive system by the stochastic statecharts method, and uses the simulation method to evaluate the performance. To make use of the feature of event-triggered state transitions in the statecharts, a new method of simulation is proposed based on the techniques of the discrete-event system simulation. The new method solves the problem of computer implementation of stochastic events, probabilistic transition, concurrent states, parallel actions, and broadcast communication mechanism in the stochastic statecharts. An example of a flexible manufacturing system is presented. The simulation result of the example is consistent with the analytical result, which shows the feasibility of the proposed new simulation method.

AB  - The identification of a model is one of the key issues in the field of fuzzy system modeling and function approximation theory. There are numerous approaches to the issue of parameter optimization within a fixed fuzzy system structure but no reliable method to obtain the optimal topology of the fuzzy system from a set of input-output data. This paper presents a reliable method to obtain the structure of a complete rule-based fuzzy system for a specific approximation accuracy of the training data, i.e., it can decide which input variables must be taken into account in the fuzzy system and how many membership functions (MFs) are needed in every selected input variable in order to reach the approximation target with the minimum number of parameters.

AB  - One-hidden-layer networks are very efficient to solve structure-unknown system identification/modeling problems. But it is difficult and often redundant to choose a basis without prior knowledge. We present in this paper a new algorithm named orthogonal maximum correntropy (OMC), with which a robust and parsimonious system-identification/model-selection process is reached. Moreover, the proposed method is capable of suppressing non-Gaussian, especially heavy-tailed noises that may be encountered in the datasets, benefiting from the maximum correntropy criterion. Experiments on some common models such as polynomial NARx, RBF networks, and wavelet networks, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - A recommendation system for meta-modeling: A meta-learning based approach
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Various meta-modeling techniques have been developed to replace computationally expensive simulation models. The performance of these meta-modeling techniques on different models is varied which makes existing model selection/recommendation approaches (e.g., trial-and-error, ensemble) problematic. To address these research gaps, we propose a general meta-modeling recommendation system using meta-learning which can automate the meta-modeling recommendation process by intelligently adapting the learning bias to problem characterizations. The proposed intelligent recommendation system includes four modules: (1) problem module, (2) meta-feature module which includes a comprehensive set of meta-features to characterize the geometrical properties of problems, (3) meta-learner module which compares the performance of instance-based and model-based learning approaches for optimal framework design, and (4) performance evaluation module which introduces two criteria, Spearman's ranking correlation coefficient and hit ratio, to evaluate the system on the accuracy of model ranking prediction and the precision of the best model recommendation, respectively. To further improve the performance of meta-learning for meta-modeling recommendation, different types of feature reduction techniques, including singular value decomposition, stepwise regression and ReliefF, are studied. Experiments show that our proposed framework is able to achieve 94% correlation on model rankings, and a 91% hit ratio on best model recommendation. Moreover, the computational cost of meta-modeling recommendation is significantly reduced from an order of minutes to seconds compared to traditional trial-and-error and ensemble process. The proposed framework can significantly advance the research in meta-modeling recommendation, and can be applied for data-driven system modeling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A comprehensive study on partial shading response of c-Si modules and yield modeling of string inverter and module level power electronics
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Building Integrated and Building Attached Photovoltaic (BIPV, BAPV) systems may suffer from lower performance than predicted as a result of not considered partial shading. New system architectures have been proposed to optimize performance. The common approach of these new architectures is to track the Maximum Power Point (MPP) of every solar module individually. A simulation model is developed to quantify the benefits and drawbacks of different PV system architectures. The model includes a shading evaluation of the installation with means of 3D modeling, irradiance calculations, PV cell modeling and finally an empirical power conversion model. The energy yield of three leading architectures is confirmed (string inverter, power optimizer, micro inverter) for clear and partial shading conditions by means of an outdoor field test. Results with the irradiance profile of the Netherlands show that the string inverter system outperforms MLPE in 2 out of 3 partial shading scenarios that were evaluated in this study. It is found that the energy yield benefit of MLPE has a seasonal and latitude variation with the highest contribution during winter months. Additionally a study was performed to evaluate the energy yield at different irradiance profiles. Results show that there is a marginal benefit of the micro inverter system at higher irradiance locations when partial shading is present. The analysis method can be used by PV installers and system designer to determine which is the optimal system architecture for maximum energy yield especially when partial shading is present.

TI  - Evaluating the performance of distributed architectures for information retrieval using a variety of workloads
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The information explosion across the Internet and elsewhere offers access to an increasing number of document collections. In order for users to effectively access these collections, information retrieval (IR) systems must provide coordinated, concurrent, and distributed access. In this article, we explore how to achieve scalable performance in a distributed system for collection sizes ranging from 1GB to 128GB. We implement a fully functional distributed IR system based on a multithreaded version of the Inquery unified IR system. To explore the design space more fully, we also implement and validate a flexible simulation model. We measure performance as a function of system parameters such as client command rate, number of document collections, terms per query, query term frequency, number of answers returned, and command mixture. Our results show that it is important to model both query and document commands because the heterogeneity of commands significantly impacts performance. Based on our results, we recommend simple changes to the prototype and evaluate the changes using the simulator. Because of the significant resource demands of information retrieval, it is not difficult to generate workloads that overwhelm system resources regardless of the architecture. However under some realistic workloads, we demonstrate system organizations for which response time gracefully degrades as the workload increases and performance scales with the number of processors. This scalable architecture includes a surprisingly small number of brokers through which a large number of clients and servers communicate.

AB  - We present a discrete-event macro model of a geographical region where a population has access to general practitioners (GP) and to a hospital emergency room (ER). We designed a queuing model to simulate a pool of primary care clinics of a region where patients interact with doctors if available; otherwise they may end in a hospital emergency room. Our simulation model can provide an insight on the expected results of different scenarios in terms of number of patients treated in cabinet, waiting to be treated, or treated in the emergency room. Each scenario can be associated with a cost for evaluation purposes. Then, the model could be used as a powerful aid for debate and discussion. The paper presents a first model as a feasibility proof of the concept and includes a critical view of the input data requirement and computing simulation costs of an more comprehensive system. This work represents a first step of a larger project, that we call Soleil. The aim of Soleil is to propose a decision aid system for health care management.

AB  - In the process of software development it is of high interest for a project manager to gain insights about the ongoing process and possible development trends at several points in time. Substantial factors influencing this process are, e.g., the constellation of the development team, the growth and complexity of the system, and the error-proneness of software entities. For this purpose we build an agent based simulation tool which predicts the future of a project under given circumstances, stored in parameters, which control the simulation process.We estimate these parameters with the help of software mining. Our work exposed the need for a more fine-grained model for the developer behavior. Due to this we create a learning model, which helps us to understand the contribution behavior of developers and, thereby, to determine simulation parameters close to reality. In this paper we present our agent based simulation model for software evolution and describe how methods from statistical learning and data mining serves us to estimate suitable simulation parameters.

CP  - 20th IEEE International Symposium on Real-Time Distributed Computing (ISORC)
CL  - Toronto, CANADA
AB  - Cyber-physical systems (CSPs) are demanding energy-efficient design not only of hardware (HW), but also of software (SW). Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and Dynamic Power Manage (DPM) are most popular techniques to improve the energy efficiency. However, contemporary complicated HW and SW designs requires more elaborate and sophisticated energy management and efficiency evaluation techniques. This paper is concerned about energy supply planning for real-time scheduling systems (units) of which tasks need to meet deadlines. This paper presents a model-based compositional energy planning technique that computes a minimal ratio of processor frequency that preserves schedulability of independent and preemptive tasks. The minimal ratio of processor frequency can be used to plan the energy supply of real-time components. Our model-based technique is extensible by refining our model with additional features so that energy management techniques and their energy efficiency can be evaluated by model checking techniques. We exploit the compositional framework for hierarchical scheduling systems and provide a new resource model for the frequency computation. As results, our use-case for avionics software components shows that our new method outperforms the classical real-time calculus (RTC) method, requiring 36.21% less frequency ratio on average for scheduling units under RM than the RTC method.

TI  - Building a Smart Campus Digital Twin: System, Analytics, and Lessons Learned From a Real-World Project
T2  - IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Smart solutions increasingly involve the use of sensor data to represent the physical world in the digital world and apply intelligence to such representation. The main approach is a vertical end-to-end solution from sensors to intelligence and back to actuators. Recently, a new holistic approach, the so-called Digital Twin, has emerged. This goes beyond traditional smart solutions by replicating, with high-fidelity cross-domain aspects, a physical object into the digital world. The key differentiation is the inclusion of semantics information in the digital replica in a form of knowledge graph. Further, analytics continuously enrich Digital Twin's information with predictions and insights. In this article, we adopt the Digital Twin approach for the creation of a digital replica of Espinardo's campus at the University of Murcia (Spain). The starting point is the existing sensor network deployment and the infrastructure under development of Fog-Edge-Cloud computing based on a 5G private network. The smart campus Digital Twin is formed by the Digital Twins of 23 buildings for which different sets of data features have been thoroughly selected. We implement the concept of Digital Twin by merging sensor data with external open data sources, analytics models implemented, and information processed by these analytics. We report our experience showing the issues encountered handling the data and producing various analytics models for predicting energy consumption, building occupancy, room usage, solar energy, and anomaly detection. From our experience, we highlight some lessons learned and directions toward the full operational smart campus Digital Twin.

M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - The proposal is to enable students from educational institutions in the United States to attend the CPSWeek 2015 collection of conferences, which are to be held April 13-17, 2015, in Seattle, Washington. CPSWeek is an annual international multi-conference for Cyber-Physical Systems, comprising five major multi-day conferences, multiple one-day workshops and tutorials. It moves from country to country each year. Attending the conference will provide students with a unique opportunity to listen to and learn from the keynote speeches, presentations, posters and demos on cutting edge topics on cyber-physical systems, and to network with both leaders and other young researchers in this area.CPS research is expected to have positive societal impacts in many areas, including transportation, energy, agriculture, water/sewage treatment, environmental management and manufacturing systems. These systems must operate safely, dependably, securely, efficiently and respond to events in real time. A key feature of CPS research is the requirement to cooperate across disciplines such as computer science, computer architecture and hardware, materials science and sensor design, software engineering, networking, and control engineering. In this inherently interdisciplinary field, where collaborations are essential, meeting other researchers is especially important. CPSWeek brings together the U.S. and international CPS research community. For these reasons, strong participation in this event, especially among students (our next generation of researchers) is important to maintaining and advancing CPS research in the U.S. In particular, this project supports students from groups and institutions that are underrepresented in the CPS research community.

AB  - The emergence of cyber-physical systems and connected objects is helping to increase the technical complexity that enables the integration and the collaboration of information systems. This highly heterogeneous digital environment, subject to constant change, requires both the improvement of companies' capacity for change and the rapid and effective expansion of their digital organization in a flexible and agile manner. In a rapidly changing industrial context, ensuring, and maintaining the digital continuity of information at all levels of the company becomes a major challenge from an economic, technical, and organizational perspective. To meet Industry 4.0 requirements for agility, flexibility, and responsiveness, a "plug- and-play" approach that breaks away from fixed norms and standards seems to be the solution to promote sustainable and on demand interoperability of systems. In this paper, the specifications of the "plug-and-play" are presented. Thus, a qualitative comparison is made between the ontology approach and the Model-Driven-Engineering approach. The goal is to compare their ability to ensure semantic interoperability of systems, and thus digital continuity, based on the criteria of genericity, dynamism, connectivity, integration, and federation capability.

This paper reports on the approach adopted for a Master's Degree course at Politecnico di Milano, Italy, as an attempt to reverse this trend by introducing collaborative learning activities. Students put concepts learned during theoretical lectures into practice through a hands-on group assignment. Each group develops the formal model of a Cyber-Physical System through the Uppaal tool, starting from a set of requirements provided by the instructor. After delivering the assignment, we invite students to fill an evaluation survey whose results suggest a very high satisfaction level towards the hybrid theoretical-practical approach of the course.

TI  - A Digital Twin-Based Platform towards Intelligent Automation with Virtual Counterparts of Flight and Air Traffic Control Operations
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Automation technologies have been deployed widely to boost the efficiency of production and operations, to trim the complicated process, and to reduce the human error involved. Nevertheless, aviation remains human-centred and requires collaboration between different parties. Given the lack of a collaborative decision-making training platform for air traffic operations in the industry, this study utilises the concept of cyber-physical systems (CPS) to formulate a system architecture for pilots and air traffic control officers training in collaborative decision making by linking and integrating the virtual counterparts of flights and air traffic control operations. Collaborative decision-making training and the corresponding intelligent automation aids could be realised and supported. A performance analysis via a flight task undertaken with different computational load settings was prepared to evaluate the platform's latency and integrity. The latency is presented using its 95% confidence interval, and integrity is presented using the percentage of data loss during wireless transmission. The results demonstrated convincing performance and a promising system robustness in both domains.

TI  - Integration of Improvement Strategies and Industry 4.0 Technologies in a Dynamic Evaluation Model for Target-Oriented Optimization
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured Application Facilitate the optimization of relevant KPIs to increase the long-term sustainability of manufacturing organizations thanks to a novel model for the integration of improvement strategies and Industry 4.0 related technologies, and for an optimized sequence model for Industry 4.0 technologies, the GUVEI-Model, as well as for the dynamic evaluation for defining optimization alternatives aligned with organizational targets. Many improvement techniques, methods, and technologies have been the driver of the development of supply chain systems. However, many managers and companies are focused only on new technologies without considering a comprehensive evaluation, and therefore lacking a real need and purpose. As a result, practitioners are often confused with regard of how to integrate improvement strategies and new technologies, as well as how to evaluate their convenience. Thus, this research aims to develop a model for the assessment for each manufacturing capability. This assessment aims to enable a continuous business transformation aligned with organizational goals; thus, a dynamic maturity assessment is chosen. Based on this, the study seeks to provide an integration model for relevant improvement strategies and new technologies that can be applied to any organization. As a result, the paper develops a sequence model, the GUVEI-Model, for the application of Industry 4.0 related technologies for continuous improvement in five different clusters. Furthermore, the research develops an evaluation scheme of optimization alternatives. Based on this conceptual development, a simulation model is built for specific use cases, such as additive manufacturing or virtual reality. The results show how the use cases along the GUVEI-Model application improve relevant indicators significantly, with the first two steps, obtaining and using data, acting as enablers of the three subsequent optimization steps that allow the virtualization, expansion, and improvement of capabilities and a higher impact on the target indicators than the first two steps. Finally, a discussion is presented about the utility of digital twin models for dynamic maturity level assessment and for simulating project improvement impacts before, during, and after their implementation.

TI  - I-Corps: Market Evaluation for Credible Autocoding (MECA)
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Automobiles, airplanes, and radio-therapy machines are all examples of safety-critical cyber-physical systems, i.e., systems that bring together software and physical artifacts to form intelligent systems of high functional value to society. These systems are called safety-critical, because unanticipated failures can rapidly lead to the loss of lives. This project is concerned with investigating the needs of industry for the development of future generations of cyber-physical systems, with a specific emphasis on software's impact on overall system safety. By properly identifying industry's needs, the team will be able to establish an effective and relevant safety-critical software development process and formulate recommendations about the products that need developing in support of this process. To do so, the investigators will engage into a series of face-to-face interviews with industry representatives, and the findings of the interviews will be shared with business development specialists. To support the interviews, the team will rely on its experience with building a prototype tool that automatically turns high-level safety-critical software specifications into error-free computer programs. Credible autocoding, a term coined by the project team, is the activity whereby cyber-physical software system specifications are transformed into code, together with the verifiable assurance that the code itself meets those system specifications. The hypothesis of this project is that credible autocoding will contribute to reaching the very high levels of safety these systems must achieve in order to be accepted by civil society; the lower development costs enabled by credible autocoding will also ensure that a broader share of the population will be able to enjoy the benefits of the cyber-physical revolution, as this will allow small companies to compete in a market where currently only big players can afford extreme costs of safety-critical software certification. This study will consist of on-site interviews with several decision-makers working with the markets in which credible autocoding might be a necessity. The outcome of these interviews will be presented in a structured fashion to experts accredited by the NSF I-Corps management at regular intervals. A positive outcome would provide a solid base upon which the I-Corps team can obtain funding and proceed with product development activities meeting industry?s needs. No matter what the outcome, these results will give the team an opportunity to adapt its product definition effort. Such an adaptation may occur at all levels, ranging from product packaging to the basic research options pursued by the team in the area of safety-critical, cyber-physical systems. These activities will be supported by Gene-Auto+, the team's credible autocoding prototype developed under prior funding from NSF.

TI  - A Zero Trust Hybrid Security and Safety Risk Analysis Method
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Designing complex, socio-technical, cyber-physical systems has become increasingly challenging in recent years. Interdependencies between engineering domains can lead to emergent behavior that is difficult to predict and manage. The recent shift toward model-based design has demonstrated significant advantages for minimizing these challenges (McDermott et al. 2020. Benchmarking the benefits and current maturity of model-based systems engineering across the enterprise. results of the model-based systems engineering (MBSE) maturity survey, part 1: Executive summary. Technical Report SERC-2020-SR-001, Systems Engineering Research Center.). Further, the early identification of safety and security design weaknesses in safety-critical systems leads to reduced redesign costs in later design phases (Yang and EI-Haik, 2003. Design for Six Sigma. McGraw-Hill, New York City; Clausing and Frey, 2005. Improving system reliability by failure-mode avoidance including four concept design strategies. Systems Engineering, 8(3), pp. 245-261.). As a result, this article contributes the Multidisciplinary Early Design Risk Assessment Framework (MEDRAF) methodology for early combined safety and security assessment based on interdisciplinary dependency models of a system. The focus is on factors contributing to the estimation of the probabilities of successful attacks on system components. The Zero Trust paradigm is applied in which all humans, hardware, and processes interacting with the system are considered to pose a security risk. A calculation of security-related probability estimates is presented which is dependent on the current global security environment. Subsequently, security and safety probability estimates are combined to present an overall safety-security risk calculation using hybrid safety-security trees. The risk values help designers assess the loss of specific key components and safety functions. The methodology is demonstrated with a case study of a spent fuel pool cooling system in a nuclear reactor. The results of the case study show that the risk of losing one key system component doubles when combining security and safety compared to only assessing safety events. This paper is based on a paper presented at the CIE 2020 conference (Papakonstantinou et al., 2020. Towards a zero trust hybrid security and safety risk analysis method. In International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference, American Society of Mechanical Engineers.).

AB  - Future smart factories will be increasingly required to predict expected performance and dependability metrics related to their production processes. Domain-specific metrics include overall equipment effectiveness that measures production system availability/uptime, performance/speed and output quality. In this work-in-progress paper, we take initial steps towards a model-based approach to evaluate production-specific metrics using domain-specific languages, model transformations and stochastic modelling formalism.

TI  - SIMULATION-BASED WORKFORCE ASSIGNMENT CONSIDERING POSITION IN A SOCIAL NETWORK
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2010 WINTER SIMULATION CONFERENCE
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 2010 Winter Simulation Conference
CL  - Baltimore, MD
AB  - Globally distributed software enhancement necessitates joint efforts of workforces across various organizations, which constitutes a multifaceted social network. Here, we propose a novel modeling framework to optimally assign the workforce to software development projects considering both short and long-term benefits of the organization. The proposed framework is composed of the evaluation module, an agent-based simulation model representing the considered social network; and the assignment module, a multi-objective optimization model. The Decision Evolution Procedure of the evaluation module first calculates the position values between each pair of available workforce. Using these position values, the Extended Regular Equivalence Evaluation algorithm of the evaluation module then computes the regular and structural equivalence values between each pair of workforce. Finally, the assignment module selects the optimal workforce mix maximizing both the short (productivity) and long-term performance (robustness) of the organization. The proposed framework is demonstrated with the software enhancement process in Kuali organizational network.

TI  - Representative Real-Time Dataset Generation Based on Automated Fault Injection and HIL Simulation for ML-Assisted Validation of Automotive Software Systems
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, a data-driven approach has been widely used at various stages of the system development lifecycle thanks to its ability to extract knowledge from historical data. However, despite its superiority over other conventional approaches, e.g., approaches that are model-based and signal-based, the availability of representative datasets poses a major challenge. Therefore, for various engineering applications, new solutions to generate representative faulty data that reflect the real world operating conditions should be explored. In this study, a novel approach based on a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation and automated real-time fault injection (FI) method is proposed to generate, analyse and collect data samples in the presence of single and concurrent faults. The generated dataset is employed for the development of machine learning (ML)-assisted test strategies during the system verification and validation phases of the V-cycle development model. The developed framework can generate not only time series data but also a textual data including fault logs in an automated manner. As a case study, a high-fidelity simulation model of a gasoline engine system with a dynamic entire vehicle model is utilised to demonstrate the capabilities and benefits of the proposed framework. The results reveal the applicability of the proposed framework in simulating and capturing the system behaviour in the presence of faults occurring within the system's components. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed framework in analysing system behaviour and acquiring data during the validation phase of real-time systems under realistic operating conditions has been demonstrated.

CP  - 11th International Conference on Computer Aided Architectural Design Futures
CL  - Vienna Univ Technol, Vienna, AUSTRIA
AB  - To facilitate the practice improvement by use of simulation tools in construction, the present research generalizes the main characteristics that differentiate a construction system from a manufacturing system in light of simulation modeling. The PROMODEL simulation platform which is influential and popular in manufacturing is chosen for (1) validating the newly developed construction simulation platform called SDESA (the Simplified Discrete-Event Simulation Approach); and (2) identifying the differences between manufacturing and construction simulations by applying PROMODEL alongside SDESA to typical construction systems. In modeling a simple earth-moving operation and a real site operation integrating concreting and waste handling practices, the validity of SDESA is cross checked by the established PROMODEL and SDESA is found to be more flexible and straightforward in addressing construction systems in terms of (1) representing vehicle-loop work flows, (2) modeling resource transit times between various locations on site, (3) deriving resource utilization rates, and (4) learning efforts and application time requirements. The comparisons made can be taken as guidance for helping construction practitioners (1) to distinguish the modeling needs between construction and manufacturing simulations and (2) to select the suitable simulation tools for practice improvement.

AB  - A study is performed to investigate the state evolution of a kind of recurrent neural network. The state variable in the neural system summarize the information of external excitation and initial state, and determine its future response. The recurrent neural network is trained by the data from a dynamic system so that it can behave like the dynamic system. The dynamic systems include both input-output black-box system and autonomous chaotic system. It is found that the state variables in neural system differ from the state variable in the black-box system identified, this case often appears when the network is trained with input-output data of the system. The recurrent neural system learning from chaotic system exhibits an expected chaotic character, its state variable is the same as the system identified at the first period of evolution and its state evolution is sensitive to its initial state.

AB  - Since the introduction of the term Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in 2006, they came to a long way. CPS are now autonomous and networked systems of systems with state-space exceeding the capabilities of conventional risk analysis methods. Model-based fault injection methods allow assessment of a system's fault tolerance not only during its design phase but also in the course of operation. This allows the evaluation of updates and new modules before deploying such changes to a real system. Such operational model-based fault injection on a system's digital twin can ensure continuous safety throughout all system life cycles.Modern risk analysis tools and Machine Learning-based safety methods require vast amounts of representative input and training data. Such methods not only will require mountains of erroneous time-series data from a myriad of operational cycles, but also corresponding fault parameter labels. As the state space of the system component explodes in complexity, it becomes problematic to cover all possible component fault combinations. As such, only those faults that could lead to potential failures or increased risk scenarios are of interest for automated safety assessment methodologies. It is clear that an intelligent and effective model-based fault injection method is required for the operational safety assessment of industrial CPS.Recently we introduced a new model-based fault injection method implemented as a highly customizable Simulink block called FIBlock. It supports the model-based injection of typical faults of CPS components such as sensors, software, computing, and network hardware. In this paper, we proposed a Deep Learning-based approach for model-based fault injection called FIDGET. It extends the FIBlock with Deep Reinforcement Learning capabilities. We employed a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to train the Reinforcement Learning agent to perform the automated search of fault parameters that yield the biggest system response. It allows automatic generation of labeled training data for further use in risk analysis tools or to train fault classifiers. The generated training data consists of errors that lead to the biggest response (i.e., disturbance) of the system.

CP  - 4th IEEE International Verification and Security Workshop (IVSW)
CL  - GREECE
AB  - Fault injection methods as a type of physical attack have gained significant importance in the security of MCU-based Internet-of-Things (IoTs) systems and they continue to become more and more important as the value of assets continues to increase. These attacks can pose severe security risks to the entire IoT system and their effects can quickly lead to security breaches. However, embedded software developers most often do not have the necessary expertise concerning existing vulnerabilities against such attacks. This makes it necessary to have a practical evaluation platform for measuring the degree of security, in a rapid and accurate way. These platforms are important not only from the performance and capability point of view, but also they need to be cost-effective, which is a critical factor to consider during their design. We present in this work a generic low cost and open platform, called HackMyMCU framework. While this platform offers both side channel and fault injection capabilities, this paper focuses on its clock glitch attacks. A first review of existing clock-based fault injectors is initially performed. Then we present two different clock glitchers and we use them to evaluate a modern MCU. The suggested methods consider the necessary parameters for the development of cost-effective and easy to use evaluation platforms which utilize easily accessible equipment. The findings show that a common and low-cost evaluation platform can be implemented with the goal to validate appropriate countermeasures against such attacks.

AB  - Reducing the energy consumption of a complex, especially cyber-physical, system is a cross-cutting concern through the system layers, and typically requires long feedback loops between experts in several engineering disciplines. Having an immediate automatic estimation of the global system consumption at design-time would significantly accelerate this process, but cross-layer tools are missing in several domains.Executable domain-specific modeling languages (xDSLs) can be used to design several layers of the system under development in an integrated view. By including the behavioral specification for software and physical components of the system, they are an effective source artifact for cross-layer energy estimation.In this paper we propose EEL, a language for annotating xDSL primitives with energy-related properties, i.e. how their execution would contribute to the energy consumption on a specific runtime platform. Given an xDSL, energy specialists create EEL models of that xDSL for each considered runtime platform. The models are used at design time, to predict the energy consumption of the real systems. This avoids the need of energetic analysis by deployment and measurement on all runtime platforms, that is slow and expensive.We augment an existing language workbench for xDSLs with an editor for EEL models and a component that computes energy-consumption estimations during model editing. The evaluation shows that EEL can be used to represent estimation models from literature, and provide useful predictions.

Most analytical operations are performed directly using GIS analytical tools, while for more specialized enquiries dynamic models are implemented.At present, the decision support system scope concerns flood hydrology and hydraulic risk mitigation, while future development will regard water resource management and water quality.As a special component of the system, an original methodology for the evaluation of requirements to keep land use change hydrologically invariant is implemented and is currently under field testing.The system is directed to support communicative rationality in basin-level land use planning and management, and is strictly coupled with the steps of the planning and conflict management processes.

TI  - Leveraging Gametic Heredity in Oversampling Techniques to Handle Class Imbalance for Efficient Cyberthreat Detection in IIoT
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONSUMER ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) have gained significant attraction; however, it remains a vulnerable target for cyberattacks. Machine learning techniques have garnered interest in security applications due to their rapid processing capabilities and real-time predictions. However, imbalanced data distribution is a prevalent issue in IIoT environments, adversely affecting ML-based attack detection systems. In this work, we present a novel gametic heredity-based oversampling technique for addressing imbalanced data challenges in cybersecurity applications, specifically targeting IIoT systems. The proposed model enhances diversity in the minority classes by generating unique synthetic minority samples, creating diverse synthetic data while restricting instances to the minority class region. The proposed model outperforms complex and conventional methods in terms of precision, recall & F-Score while mitigating over-generalization by evenly distributing newly generated samples within minority class boundaries and regions. To validate the proposed model and verify its efficacy in identifying cyber threats, we used the UNSW-NB15 dataset. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently detects attacks with high performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Our research contributes to developing robust & efficient machine learning models for enhancing the security of IIoT systems while handling class imbalance issues.

TI  - An asynchronous distributed training algorithm based on Gossip communication and Stochastic Gradient Descent
T2  - COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) applications are playing an increasingly important role in our lives, hence the use of centralized distributed machine learning in CPS to secure applications to start widespread use. However, existing centralized distributed machine learning (ML) algorithms have significant shortcomings in CPS scenarios. As a result, its synchronization algorithm has high latency and sensitivity to drop-off, which affects the security of CPS. Therefore, this paper combining the Gossip protocol with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), this paper proposes a communication framework Gossip Ring SGD (GR-SGD) for machine learning. GR-SGD is decentralized and asynchronous, and solves the problem of long communication waiting time. This paper uses the ImageNet data set and the ResNet model to verify the feasibility of the algorithm and compares it with Ring AllReduce and D-PSGD. Moreover, this paper also indicates that some data redundancy can reduce communication overhead and increase system fault tolerance, it can be better applied to CPS and all kinds of machine learning models.

AB  - Neural networks have shown great promises in planning, control, and general decision making for learning-enabled cyber-physical systems (LE-CPSs), especially in improving performance under complex scenarios. However, it is very challenging to formally analyze the behavior of neural network based planners for ensuring system safety, which significantly impedes their applications in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving. In this work, we propose a hierarchical neural network based planner that analyzes the underlying physical scenarios of the system and learns a system-level behavior planning scheme with multiple scenario-specific motion-planning strategies. We then develop an efficient verification method that incorporates overapproximation of the system state reachable set and novel partition and union techniques for formally ensuring system safety under our physics-aware planner. With theoretical analysis, we show that considering the different physical scenarios and building a hierarchical planner based on such analysis may improve system safety and verifiability. We also empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its advantage over other baselines in practical case studies of unprotected left turn and highway merging, two common challenging safety-critical tasks in autonomous driving.

M3  - Article
AB  - Distributed Mission Training (DMT) is a concept composed of promising technologies that support training in a variety of domains such as defense and medicine. To develop and deploy such systems, it is important to account concurrently for hardware and software requirements, given high demands for network bandwidth, computing resources, and complexity of software applications. In this paper, we present the application of a distributed co-design methodology (Discrete Event System Specification/Distributed Object Computing) as applied to the Mission Training and Rehearsal System (MTRS), a DMT system. For an example, we show that the developed simulation models allow prediction of the network capacity below which messages cannot be sent and therefore incorrect behavior results. The key issues presented are (1) characterization of the DMT style architectures in DEVS/DOC, (2) prediction of DMT-like basic scalability traits via simulation, and, (3) discussion on some open problems underlying the applicability of distributed co-design for systems.. containing "off-the-shelf" components.

AB  - This article explores using discrete-event simulation for the design and control of defense oriented fixed- sensor-based detection systems in a facility housing items of significant interest to enemy forces. The key issues discussed include software development, simulation-based optimization within a modeling framework, and the expansion of the framework to create real-time control tools and training simulations. The software discussed in this article is a flexible simulation environment where the data for the simulation are stored in an external database and the simulation logic is being implemented using a commercial simulation package. The simulation assesses the overall security level of a building against various intruder scenarios. A series of simulation runs with different inputs can determine the change in security level with changes in the sensor configuration, building layout, and intruder/guard strategies. In addition, the simulation model developed for the design stage of the project can be modified to produce a control tool for the testing training, and real-time control of systems with humans and sensor hardware in the loop.

AB  - In order to model nonlinear systems with more accuracy, and to further exploit the potential capacities of recurrent neural networks, we propose a novel recursive least square (RLS) algorithm based on echo state network (ESN), and note it as RLSESN in this paper. ESN is a new paradigm for using recurrent neural networks (RNN) with a simpler training method. The proposed RLSESN consists of three main components: an ESN, a recursive least square (RLS) algorithm with adaptive forgetting factor and a change detection module. At first, the change detection module modifies the forgetting factor online according to ESN output errors. And then, the RLS algorithm regulates the ESN output connection weights. The simulation experiment results show that RLSESN can model nonlinear systems very well; the modeling performances are significantly better than those traditional ARMA model based filters.

AB  - Real-time simulation enables the understanding of system operating conditions by evaluating simulation models of physical components running synchronized at the real-time wall clock. Leveraging the real-time measurements of comprehensive system models, faster than real-time (FTRT) simulation allows the evaluation of system architectures at speeds faster than real-time. FTRT simulation can assist in predicting the system's behavior efficiently, thus assisting the operation of system processes. Namely, the provided acceleration can be used for improving system scheduling, assessing system vulnerabilities, and predicting system disruptions in real-time systems. The acceleration of simulation times can be achieved by utilizing digital real-time simulators (RTS) and high-performance computing (HPC) architectures. FTRT simulation has been widely used, among others, for the operation, design, and investigation of power system events, building emergency management plans, wildfire prediction, etc. In this paper, we reviewthe existing literature on FTRT simulation and its applications in different disciplines, with a particular focus on power systems. We present existing system modeling approaches, simulation tools and computing frameworks, and stress the importance of FTRT accuracy.

AB  - From antiquity until nowadays, educational systems have evolved in parallelwith major social and economic changes, integrating pedagogical and technological innovations into the educational ecosystem and leading to the advent of a new educational revolution, called Education 4.0. The Education 4.0 paradigm allows both, to support educational organizations in the adoption of pedagogical and digital transformations, and at the same time to meet the needs of new generations of learners and teachers. The increasing use of ICT and the power of the Internet have fostered the emergence of a new generation of learners for whom technology is an integral part of their lives and therefore of their learning style. To respond effectively to the specific needs of these new learner profiles, educational organizations must adopt significant and ongoing transformations in the way we teach and learn. Enabling student-centered teaching, personalized learning paths, and access to a variety of heterogeneous educational resources have made educational processes too complex for the educator to effectively monitor the individual progress of each student. It becomes necessary to automate the management of learning processes to provide better answers to the evolving and specific needs of the different actors (students, educators, training program managers, companies, etc.). This research project aims at proposing an autonomous architecture of Cyber-Physical systems for Education 4.0. This architecture responds to the needs of educational systems, integrating digital technologies for the development of heterogeneous learning environments, capable of meeting the needs of a plurality of learners with different profiles and supporting teachers and training managers in the management of learning processes. This architecture offers the possibility of autonomous management of learning processes to analyze the progress of students and to prescribe the necessary recommendations to increase the chances of success, facilitating the mission of teachers.

TI  - EMF-Syncer: scalable maintenance of view models over heterogeneous data-centric software systems at run time
T2  - SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS MODELING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing presence of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), like autonomous vehicle systems and digital twins, the future of software engineering is predicated on the importance of designing and developing data-centric software systems that can adapt intelligently at run time. CPSs consist of complex heterogeneous software components. Model-driven engineering advocates using software models to tame such complexity, capturing the relevant design concerns of such systems at different levels of abstraction. Yet most of the existing CPSs are engineered without considering MDE practices and tools, facing fundamental challenges when working with data: monitoring the program data at run time, syncing updates between program and model, dealing with heterogeneous data sources, and representing such observed data at run time to facilitate automated analysis. In this work, we introduce the notion of view models to explicitly represent parts of the domain knowledge implicitly embedded in the source code of a software system. This notion is equipped with a scalable bidirectional syncing mechanism that extracts view model instances from program snapshots at run time. The syncing mechanism is proposed from a conceptual point of view, independently of specific implementations and supports incremental view model update and view model maintenance. We show how this syncing mechanism is flexible enough to facilitate the non-intrusive adoption of MDE technology over existing MDE-agnostic heterogeneous data-centric systems. We study the run-time cost implied by the EMF-Syncer , the tool implementing this syncing mechanism for Java applications and view models atop the eclipse modeling framework (EMF) when executing data analytic and transformation tasks over large volumes of data in the presence of data updates at run time. An empirical evaluation of the EMF-Syncer has been conducted with an industry-targeted benchmark for decision support systems, analyzing performance and scalability. The novel syncing mechanism enables new opportunities to adopt MDE technology in heterogeneous data-centric systems.

AB  - Real-time and temporal information services are intrinsic characteristics in vehicular networks, where the timeliness of data dissemination and the maintenance of data quality interplay with each other and influence overall system performance. In this work, we present the system architecture where multiple road side units (RSUs) are cooperated to provide information services, and the vehicles can upload up-to-date information to RSUs via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. On this basis, we formulate the distributed temporal data management (DTDM) problem as a two-objective problem, which aims to enhance overall system performance on both the service quality and the service ratio simultaneously. Further, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called MO-DTDM to obtain a set of pareto solutions and analyze how to fulfill given requirements on system performance with obtained pareto solutions. Finally, we build the simulation model and give a comprehensive performance evaluation, which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed optimization method.

AB  - With the rapid advancement of technologies in the era of Industry 4.0, the inter-connected nature of operations and systems is introducing a rapidly changing landscape of digitized and connected systems. Cybercrime is considered as possibly the greatest threat to connected systems worldwide, and therefore there exists a large drive in engineering to include cybersecurity in the design, development and maintenance of smart cyber-physical systems. Traditionally, the cybersecurity space was considered the responsibility of Information Technology (IT) professionals, where the greater IT infrastructure was required to keep these engineering systems safe. However, through the evolution of engineering and control systems, the IT infrastructure has started to become more integrated with these systems, improving the efficiency of the systems, but also making them more susceptible to cyber-attacks. These changes mean that securing these systems cannot remain the sole responsibility of the IT professionals, as systems must be designed with cybersecurity in mind. Considering that engineers are designing and developing more integrated systems, there exists a knowledge gap in the field of cybersecurity engineering and engineers' understanding of their cybersecurity responsibilities. This study aimed to determine the level of security that is currently considered in standard electrical engineering projects in a typical academic environment. This baseline serves as a motivation to develop a practical approach to assist engineering students in considering cybersecurity when developing engineering systems and products.

TI  - Cost-effective simulation-based test selection in self-driving cars software
T2  - SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulation environments are essential for the continuous development of complex cyberphysical systems such as self-driving cars (SDCs). Previous results on simulation-based testing for SDCs have shown that many automatically generated tests do not strongly contribute to the identification of SDC faults, hence do not contribute towards increasing the quality of SDCs. Because running such "uninformative " tests generally leads to a waste of computational resources and a drastic increase in the testing cost of SDCs, testers should avoid them. However, identifying "uninformative " tests before running them remains an open challenge. Hence, this paper proposes SDC-Scissor, a framework that leverages Machine Learning (ML) to identify SDC tests that are unlikely to detect faults in the SDC software under test, thus enabling testers to skip their execution and drastically increase the cost-effectiveness of simulation-based testing of SDCs software. Our evaluation concerning the usage of six ML models on two large datasets characterized by 22'652 tests showed that SDC-Scissor achieved a classification F1-score up to 96%. Moreover, our results show that SDC-Scissor outperformed a randomized baseline in identifying more failing tests per time unit.

TI  - Fault-Adaptive Autonomy in Systems with Learning-Enabled Components
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) must be robust against potential failure modes, including physical degradations and software issues, and are required to self-manage contingency actions for these failures. Physical degradations often have a significant impact on the vehicle dynamics causing irregular behavior that can jeopardize system safety and mission objectives. The paper presents a novel Behavior Tree-based autonomy architecture that includes a Fault Detection and Isolation Learning-Enabled Component (FDI LEC) with an Assurance Monitor (AM) designed based on Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) techniques. The architecture implements real-time contingency-management functions using fault detection, isolation and reconfiguration subsystems. To improve scalability and reduce the false-positive rate of the FDI LEC, the decision-making logic provides adjustable thresholds for the desired fault coverage and acceptable risk. The paper presents the system architecture with the integrated FDI LEC, as well as the data collection and training approach for the LEC and the AM. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture using a simulated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) based on the BlueROV2 platform.

TI  - A Comparative Analysis of Software Aging in Image Classifiers on Cloud and Edge
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image classifiers for recognizing real-world objects are widely used in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems(CPSs). A classifier is trained offline by machine learning algorithms with training data sets, and then it is deployed on a cloud or an edge computing system for online label predictions. As the classifier's performance depends on the underlying software infrastructure, it may degrade over time due to software faults causing software aging. In this paper, we address this issue and experimentally investigate software aging observed in an image classification system that continuously runs on cloud and edge computing environments. We apply several statistical techniques to analyze degradation trends in the systems under stress tests. Our statistical trend analysis confirms the degradation trends in the throughput as well as the available memory resources both in the cloud and the edge environments. Contrary to our expectation, the edge computing environment under test had much less impact on the performance degradation than our cloud environment when the workload is high, although the latter one has four times larger allocated memory resources. We also show that the observed performance degradation trends are associated with the memory usage of specific processes by performing correlation analysis.

AB  - The complexity of systems continues to increase rapidly, especially due to the multi-level integration of subsystems from different domains into cyber-physical systems. This results in special challenges for the efficient verification and validation (V&V) of these systems with regard to their requirements and properties. In order to tackle the new challenges and improve the quality assurance processes, the V&V workflows have to be documented and analyzed. In this paper, a novel approach for the workflow modelling of V&V activities is presented. The generic approach is tailorable to different industrial domains and their specific constraints, V&V methods, and toolchains. The outcomes comprise a dedicated modelling notation (VVML) and tool-support using the modelling framework Enterprise Architect for the efficient documentation and implementation of workflows in the use cases. The solution enables the design of re-usable workflow assets such as V&V activities and artifacts that are exchanged between workflows. This work is part of the large scale European research project VALU3S that deals with the improvement and evaluation of V&V processes in different technical domains, focusing on safety, cybersecurity, and privacy properties.

TI  - Simulator-based Explanation and Debugging of Hazard-triggering Events in DNN-based Safety-critical Systems
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - When Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are used in safety-critical systems, engineers should determine the safety risks associated with failures (i.e., erroneous outputs) observed during testing. For DNNs processing images, engineers visually inspect all failure-inducing images to determine common characteristics among them. Such characteristics correspond to hazard-triggering events (e.g., low illumination) that are essential inputs for safety analysis. Though informative, such activity is expensive and error prone.To support such safety analysis practices, we propose Simulator-based Explanations for DNN failurEs (SEDE), a technique that generates readable descriptions for commonalities in failure-inducing, real-world images and improves the DNN through effective retraining. SEDE leverages the availability of simulators, which are commonly used for cyber-physical systems. It relies on genetic algorithms to drive simulators toward the generation of images that are similar to failure-inducing, real-world images in the test set; it then employs rule learning algorithms to derive expressions that capture commonalities in terms of simulator parameter values. The derived expressions are then used to generate additional images to retrain and improve the DNN.With DNNs performing in-car sensing tasks, SEDE successfully characterized hazard-triggering events leading to a DNN accuracy drop. Also, SEDE enabled retraining leading to significant improvements in DNN accuracy, up to 18 percentage points.

TI  - A Reliable Deep Learning Approach for Time-Varying Faults Identification: Spacecraft Reaction Wheel Case Study
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reaction wheels are key components for the spacecraft attitude control subsystems. Faults in reaction wheels may lead to high energy consumption, lack of spacecraft attitude control, and in case of failure, loss of the spacecraft. The accurate identification of reaction wheels anomalies is a challenging task due to the internal nonlinearities of the reaction wheels. This study proposes a fast and accurate end-to-end architecture for detecting and identifying the anomalies occurring in spacecraft reaction wheels using One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network architecture. 1D-CNN is used to capture the useful features from the raw residual signals. The Long Short-Term Memory layer is used due to its effectiveness in handling the time series data and its capabilities for learning long-term dependencies. The proposed architecture is directly trained using the raw torque residual signals captured from a 3-axis attitude control subsystem simulation model. In this way, this scheme eliminates the need for a specific feature extraction method. Results showed that the proposed algorithm represents a reliable and robust anomaly detection and identification mechanism with compact system architecture. Furthermore, the obtained results revealed the superiority and generalizability of the proposed model in diagnosing time-varying reaction wheel faults over other recent approaches. Ultimately, the proposed approach is considered to be a generic fault diagnosis architecture for safety-critical systems.

AB  - The deployment of security measures and the provision of quality of service represents two critical and tightly coupled challenges in the design and operation of network services, architectures, and protocols in today's converged communication networks. Security and performance are not necessarily proportional to each other. It is common that; high security measures lead to high reliability results. However over-dimensioned security measures can adversely affect the networks performance and thus the services' quality of experience. For example a lightweight security algorithm may represent a security breach to an E-commerce application. On the other hand, heavyweight algorithm could impact negatively the service performance. This paper presents a dynamic security system architecture that weighs the trade-off between resources, costs and risks for tuning the network security profile to optimize the performance of communication networks. The paper explores a framework to define the network security profile concept and identify its usage for security analysis and vulnerability assessment for enhancing the networks' performance. A simulation model is developed using OPNET to ground the model analytics under heavy load conditions.

Safety assurance cases (ACs) are structured arguments designed to comprehensively show that such systems are safe; however, the reasoning steps, or strategies, used in AC arguments are often informal and difficult to rigorously evaluate. Consequently, AC arguments are prone to fallacies, and unsafe systems have been deployed as a result of fallacious ACs. To mitigate this problem, prior work [32] created a set of provably valid AC strategy templates to guide developers in building rigorous ACs. Yet instantiations of these templates remain error-prone and still need to be reviewed manually.In this paper, we report on using the interactive theorem prover Lean to bridge the gap between safety arguments and rigorous model-based reasoning. We generate formal, modelbased machine-checked AC arguments, taking advantage of the traceability between model and safety artifacts, and mitigating errors that could arise from manual argument assessment. The approach is implemented in an extended version of the MMINT-A model management tool [10]. Implementation includes a conversion of informal claims into formal Lean properties, decomposition into formal sub-properties and generation of correctness proofs. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach on two safety case studies from the literature.

AB  - Even with impressive advances in formal methods, certain major challenges remain. Chief among these are environment modeling, incompleteness in specifications, and the hardness of underlying decision problems. In this paper, we characterize two trends that show great promise in meeting these challenges. The first trend is to perform verification by reduction to synthesis. The second is to solve the resulting synthesis problem by integrating traditional, deductive methods with inductive inference (learning from examples) using hypotheses about system structure. We present a formalization of such an integration, show how it can tackle hard problems in verification and synthesis, and outline directions for future work.

AB  - With buildings accounting for nearly 40 percent of global energy consumption, the improvement of energy efficiency in buildings and districts is a clear opportunity in the fight against climate change. This has led engineering practitioners as well as researchers to propose solutions for smart energy control in buildings. Simulation-based methods permits the early validation of engineering solutions for these smart energy control systems. However, since these solutions involve different engineering disciplines (e.g., software engineering, electrical engineering, etc.), different simulation tools might be employed. We propose a tool that interconnects EnergyPlus, one of the leading open-source tools for building energy simulation, with Crescendo, a tool for designing and modelling cyber-physical systems using formal methods. A preliminary evaluation suggests that the proposed solution enables the simulation between these two tools in an efficient manner.

T2  - REAL-TIME SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The heavy use of machine learning algorithms in safety-critical systems poses serious questions related to safety, security, and predictability issues, requiring novel architectural approaches to guarantee such properties. This paper presents an architecture solution that leverages heterogeneous platforms and virtualization technologies to support AI-powered applications consisting of modules with mixed criticalities and safety requirements. The hypervisor exploits the security features of the Xilinx ZCU104 MPSoCs to create two isolated execution environments: a high performance domain running deep learning algorithms under the Linux operating system and a safety-critical domain running control and monitoring functions under the freeRTOS real-time operating system. The proposed approach is validated by a use case consisting of an unmanned aerial vehicle capable of tracking moving targets using a deep neural network accelerated on the FGPA available on the platform.

TI  - Towards a Statistical Model Checking Method for Safety-Critical Cyber-Physical System Verification
T2  - SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - Safety-Critical Cyber-Physical System (SCCPS) refers to the system that if the system fails or its key functions fail, it will cause casualties, property damage, environmental damage, and other catastrophic consequences. Therefore, it is vital to verify the safety of safety critical systems. In the community, the SCCPS safety verification mainly relies on the statistical model checking methodology, but for SCCPS with extremely high safety requirements, the statistical model checking method is difficult/infeasible to sample the extremely small probability event since the probability of the system violating the safety is very low (rare property). In response to this problem, we propose a new method of statistical model checking for high-safety SCCPS. Firstly, with the CTMC-approximated SCCPS path probability space model, it leverages the maximum likelihood estimation method to learn the parameters of CTMC. Then, the embedded DTMC can be derived from CTMC, and a cross-entropy optimization model based on DTMC can be constructed. Finally, we propose an algorithm of iteratively learning the optimal importance sampling distribution on the discrete path space and an algorithm to check the statistical model of verifying the rare attribute. Eventually, experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can effectively verify the rare attributes of SCCPS. Under the same sample size, comparing with the heuristic importance sampling methods, the estimated value of this method can be better distributed around the mean value, and the related standard deviation and relative error are reduced by more than an order of magnitude.

TI  - Balancing Cobot Productivity and Longevity Through Pre-Runtime Developer Feedback
T2  - IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In our experience, the task of optimizing robot longevity and efficiency is challenging due to the limited understanding and awareness developers' have about how their code influences a robot's expected lifespan. Unfortunately, acquiring the necessary information for computations is a complex task, and the data needed for these calculations remains unattainable until after runtime. In software engineering, traditional Static Code Analysis (SCA) techniques are applied to address such challenges. Although effective in identifying software anomalies and inefficiencies without execution, current SCA techniques do not adequately address the unique requirements of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) in robotics. In this study, we propose a novel Machine Learning (ML) approach to assess robot program lines, considering the balance between speed and lifespan. Our solution, trained on data from 1325 operational collaborative robots (cobots) from the Universal Robots (UR) e-Series, classifies program lines concerning the expected lifespan of the robot, considering program line arguments, expected resource usage, and asserted joint stress. The model achieves a worst-case accuracy of 90.43% through 10-fold cross-validation with a 50% data split. We also present a selection of programming lines illustrating various robot program cases and an example of longevity improvement. Finally, we publish a dataset containing 56405 unique program line executions, aiming to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of robotic systems and support future research.

TI  - Lessons Learned from developing Industrial Applications according to RAMI 4.0 by applying Model Based Systems Engineering

CP  - 25th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)

AB  - The transformation from original production line manufacturing towards complex value creation networks causes new challenges for manufacturing companies to stay in touch with or even delimit from the competition. This new trend, resulting from the emergence of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), offers new automation possibilities by interconnecting all system components with each other. However, as those components, mainly known as Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) are usually systems themselves, the complexity of such a manufacturing system continously rises, which even has to be classified as a complex System of Systems (SoS). Having recognized the issue of the upcoming difficulties when engineering such a system, several German institutes introduced the Reference Architecture Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0), a three-dimensional framework that offers standards or methods for developing system architectures on basis of different views. Nevertheless, at the current point of view, this approach though looks good on paper, but almost none practical applications are existing yet. Thus, this paper focuses on the model-based development of system architectures according to the specifications of RAMI 4.0 in order to evaluate the practical applicability of this reference architecture for usage in actual industrial projects. This is done by utilizing two actual industrial case studies, whose models are created with the help of a specifically designed software tool, the so-called RAMI Toolbox. Based on the outcome of this work, the usage of RAMI 4.0 for application in the industrial area could be sustainably consolidated.

TI  - Reverse Engineering Models of Software Interfaces *
T2  - COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyber-physical systems consist of many hardware and software components. Over the lifetime of these systems their components are often replaced or updated. To avoid integration problems, formal specifications of component interface behavior are crucial. Such a formal specification captures not only the set of provided operations but also the order of using them and the constraints on their timing behavior. Usually the order of operations are expressed in terms of a state machine. For new components such a formal specification can be derived from requirements. However, for legacy components such interface descriptions are usually not available. So they have to be reverse engineered from existing event logs and source code. This costs a lot of time and does not scale very well. To improve the efficiency of this process, we present a passive learning technique for interface models inspired by process mining techniques. The approach is based on representing causal relations between events present in an event log and their timing information as a timed-causal graph. The graph is further processed and eventually transformed into a state machine and a set of timing constraints. Compared to other approaches in literature which focus on the general problem of inferring state-based behavior, we exploit patterns of client-server interactions in event logs.

TI  - System dynamics modelling and simulation of collaborative requirements engineering
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Requirements engineering is generally seen as a success-critical activity in the software development process. Within this context, the paper presents selected aspects of the System Dynamics modelling and simulation of the EasyWinWin requirements negotiation methodology. EasyWinWin approaches requirements definition as a learning rather than a gathering activity and aims at fostering stakeholder co-operation and involvement. It is based on the WinWin requirements negotiation model and provides a set of collaborative techniques and tools to enable stakeholder interaction. The major goal behind the modelling and simulation effort is to assess the issues associated with the social and behavioural aspects of the EasyWinWin process and to explore how these issues affect the overall outcome of the process. In this paper, we introduce the EasyWinWin process and describe its major activities. We present the overall System Dynamics-based simulation model of EasyWinWin and provide details and results of the requirements elicitation component of the model. Finally, we will discuss model validation and calibration and summarize conclusions and insights obtained. An outlook on future work rounds out the paper. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

TI  - Empirical analysis of underlying mechanisms and variability in car-following behavior
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Car-following models have been used in all microscopic traffic simulation modeling for almost half a century to describe the process of driver behavior in following each other in the traffic stream. In recent years, a detailed understanding of car-following behavior has become more essential for both the design and the assessment of advanced driver assistance systems, such as adaptive cruise control, to help improve appropriate algorithms and develop control strategies. However, previous experimental studies and models of car-following behavior have some important limitations, which make them inconsistent with real driving experience. Hence, this study aims to contribute to the better understanding of driving behavior in following a lead vehicle in car-following situations. Efforts have been made to disclose the problems and the limitations in previous experimental studies and models of car-following behavior; to build a new data collection system, including hardware and software architecture; and to investigate and discover the characteristics of real driving behavior in following a lead vehicle. It is hoped that the findings will provide clues to guide the construction of more realistic car-following models.

TI  - Real-Time Simulation Method of Flame Animation Based on the Deep Stripping Algorithm and Texture Mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the gradual integration of computers into people's work and life, it is no longer an unattainable goal to use the power of science and technology to simulate various states of matter. In the future, virtual simulation modeling technology will become more and more high-end with the improvement of the needs of the times. However, nowadays, there are many problems in generating real-time image animation. For traditional simulation methods, huge computation and realistic rendering have become technical bottlenecks. This topic takes the generation of flame animation as an example to illustrate. On the basis of the depth stripping algorithm and texture mapping method, not only particle system modeling is introduced, but also a new N-S equation is improved for research. The research results show the following. (1) The model constructed by this method has superior performance and has been greatly improved; after iteration, the error value is as low as 0.03 and the accuracy value is as high as 98%. (2) After 500 simulations, there are 399 kinds of static and 698 kinds of dynamic flames, respectively; it takes 24.01 s and 98.21 s to generate 500 incomplete animations. (3) Compared with the particle system and deep learning model for flame animation recognition and detection, the highest false alarm rate of this model is 4.6%, and the lowest is 0.9%, and the experimental effect is stable; the highest recognition of flame animation can reach 99.2%, and the lowest is 98.5%. (4) Generally speaking, experts and ordinary people have a high evaluation on the effect of this model; except for the first group, the scores are all over 80%, and the highest score can reach 85.936%. Finally, the experimental results are good, which proves the effectiveness and feasibility of this method, which has certain research contribution value. However, for the follow-up work, the algorithm and model have room for further improvement.

TI  - Specifying uncertainty in use case models
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Latent uncertainty in the context of software-intensive systems (e.g., Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs)) demands explicit attention right from the start of development. Use case modeling-a commonly used method for specifying requirements in practice, should also be extended for explicitly specifying uncertainty.Objective: Since uncertainty is a common phenomenon in requirements engineering, it is best to address it explicitly by identifying, qualifying, and, where possible, quantifying uncertainty at the beginning stage. The ultimate aim, though not within the scope of this paper, was to use these use cases as the starting point to create test-ready models to support automated testing of CPSs under uncertainty.Method: We extend the Restricted Use Case Modeling (RUCM) methodology and its supporting tool to specify uncertainty as part of system requirements. Such uncertainties include those caused by insufficient domain expertise of stakeholders, disagreements among them, and known uncertainties about assumptions about the environment of the system. The extended RUCM, called U-RUCM, inherits the features of RUCM, such as automated analyses and generation of models, to mention but a few. Consequently, U-RUCM provides all the key benefits offered by RUCM (i.e., reducing ambiguities in requirements), but also, it allows specification of uncertainties with the possibilities of reasoning and refining existing ones and even uncovering unknown ones.Results: We evaluated U-RUCM with two industrial CPS case studies. After refining RUCM models (specifying initial requirements), by applying the U-RUCM methodology, we successfully identified and specified additional 306% and 512% (previously unknown) uncertainty requirements, as compared to the initial requirements specified in RUCM. This showed that, with U-RUCM, we were able to get a significantly better and more precise characterization of uncertainties in requirement engineering.Conclusion: Evaluation results show that U-RUCM is an effective methodology (with tool support) for dealing with uncertainty in requirements engineering. We present our experience, lessons learned, and future challenges, based on the two industrial case studies.

CP  - 3rd International Formal Methods Teaching Workshop (FMTea) Held as Part of the 3rd World Congress on Formal Methods (FM)
CL  - Porto, PORTUGAL
AB  - As formal methods come into broad industrial use for verification of safety-critical hardware, software, and cyber-physical systems, there is an increasing need to teach practical skills in applying formal methods at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. In the aerospace industry, flight certification requirements like the FAA's DO-178B, DO-178C, DO-333, and DO-254, along with a series of high-profile accidents, have helped turn knowledge of formal methods into a desirable job skill for a wide range of engineering positions. We approach the question of verification from a safety-case perspective: the primary teaching goal is to impart students with the ability to look at a verification question and identify what formal methods are applicable, which tools are available, what the outputs from those tools will say about the system, and what they will not, e.g., what parts of the safety case need to be provided by other means. We overview the lectures, exercises, exams, and student projects in a mixed-level (undergraduate/graduate) Applied Formal Methods course (Additional materials are available on the course website: http://temporallogic.org/courses/AppliedFormalMethods/) taught in an Aerospace Engineering department. We highlight the approach, tools, and techniques aimed at imparting a good sense of both the state of the art and the state of the practice of formal methods in an effort to effectively prepare students headed for jobs in an increasingly formal world.

AB  - Test and evaluation is a necessary process for ensuring that engineered systems perform as intended under a variety of conditions, both expected and unexpected. In this work, we consider the unique challenges of developing a unifying test and evaluation framework for complex ensembles of cyber-physical systems with embedded artificial intelligence. We propose a framework that incorporates test and evaluation throughout not only the development life cycle, but continues into operation as the system learns and adapts in a noisy, changing, and contended environment. The framework accounts for the challenges of testing the integration of diverse systems at various hierarchical scales of composition while respecting that testing time and resources are limited. A generic use case is provided for illustrative purposes. Research directions emerging as a result of exploring the use case via the framework are suggested.

AB  - A novel least squares support vector machines based on Mexican hat wavelet kernel is presented in the paper. The wavelet kernel which is admissible support vector kernel is characterized by its local analysis and approximate orthogonality, and we can well obtain estimates for regression by applying a least squares wavelet support vector machines (LS-WSVM). To test the validity of the proposed method, this paper demonstrates that LS-WSVM can be used effectively for the identification and adaptive control of nonlinear dynamical systems. Simulation results reveal that the identification and adaptive control schemes suggested based on LS-WSVM gives considerably better performance and show faster and stable learning in comparison to neural networks or fuzzy logic systems. LS-WSVM provides an attractive approach to study the properties of complex nonlinear system modeling and adaptive control.

TI  - An evaluation of DEVS simulation tools
T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - DEVS is a popular formalism for modeling complex dynamic systems using a discrete-event abstraction. Owing to its popularity, and the simplicity of the simulation kernel, a number of tools have been constructed by academia and industry. However, each of these tools has distinct design goals and a specific programming language implementation. Consequently, each supports a specific set of formalisms, combined with a specific set of features. Performance differs significantly between different tools. We provide an overview of the current state of eight different DEVS simulation tools: ADEVS, CD++, DEVS-Suite, MS4 Me, PowerDEVS, PythonPDEVS, VLE, and X-S-Y. We compare supported formalisms, compliance, features, and performance. This paper aims to help modelers in deciding which tools to use to solve their specific problems. It further aims to help tool builders, by showing the aspects of their tools that could be extended in future tool versions.

TI  - Understanding and Statically Detecting Synchronization Performance Bugs in Distributed Cloud Systems
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In such an information society, the Internet of Things (IoT) plays an increasingly important role in our daily lives. With such a huge number of deployed IoT devices, Cyber-Physical System (CPS) calls for powerful distributed infrastructures to supply big data computing, intelligence, and storage services. With the increasingly complex distributed software infrastructures, new intricate bugs continue to manifest, causing huge economic loss. Synchronization performance problems, which means that improper synchronizations may degrade the performance and even lead to service exception, heavily influence the entire distributed cluster, imperiling the reliability of the system. As one kind of performance problems, the synchronization performance problems are acknowledged as difficult to diagnosis and fix. We collect 26 performance issues in three real-world distributed systems: HDFS, Hadoop MapReduce, and HBase, and do analysis on their root cause, fix strategy, and algorithm complexity in order to understand these synchronization performance bugs better. Then, we implement a static detection tool including critical section identifier, loop identifier, inner loop identifier, expensive loop identifier, and pruning component. After that, we evaluate our detection tool on these three distributed systems with sampled bugs. In the evaluation, our detection tool accurately finds out all the target bugs. Besides, it points out more new potential performance problems than the previous works. With the strict performance overhead, our detection tool is proved to be greatly efficient.

TI  - Assessing recycling, displacement, and environmental impacts using an economics-informed material system model
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Material production drives an increasingly large fraction of CO2-equivalent emissions. Material efficiency strategies such as recycling serve to reduce these emissions. Current analyses of the effectiveness of such strategies do not include economically induced rebound effects, overestimating the associated environmental benefits. We present a dynamic supply chain simulation model for copper through 2040 incorporating inventory-driven price evolution, dynamic material flow analysis, and life cycle assessment alongside mine-level economic evaluation of opening, closing, and production decisions. We show that permanent increases in recycling displace similar to 0.5 kilotonnes mine production per kilotonne increase in scrap supply on average, while short-lived recycling policies can lead to increased mine production. We find evidence for supply chain evolution pathways minimizing the rebound effect and maximizing displacement of primary material, where increasing refined copper and concentrate prices and decreasing demand serve to decrease mining. However, even in best-case scrap supply scenarios, CO(2)e emissions from the copper sector increase 25% by 2040 relative to 2018 due to demand growth, ore grade decline, and lower displacement among large scrap supply changes. With implementation of best available technologies across all supply chain components, we estimated 2040 CO(2)e emissions 10% below those of 2018 are possible, though still well short of 2 degrees C emissions targets. We find increasing mine taxes and royalties, reclamation costs, and exploration costs further increase displacement, as does the inclusion of scrap prices on major futures exchanges. These results highlight the importance of considering the economics of the entire material supply chain when implementing material efficiency strategies.

AB  - In this paper, we describe our methodology for designing a smart Videosurveillance system for face analysis. The system aims at increasing the security by gathering demographic statistics in highly crowded areas such as train stations, airports and shopping malls. Based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system architecture relies on the reconfigurable hardware to accelerate part of the computation and reduce the power consumption compared to general-purpose processors and GPUs. To achieve easy programmability, the platform makes use of the OmpSs programming model, which provides parallelization and acceleration by using simple directives to be added to the sequential code. The rsource-intensive tasks are offloaded to the reconfigurable hardware in order to achieve the desired performance levels. Our evaluation shows that we can detect more than 600 faces per frame, while keeping the power consumption at about 8W. The tests were performed by using the AXIOM hardware/software platform.

TI  - A New Perspective for Computational Social Systems: Fuzzy Modeling and Reasoning for Social Computing in CPSS
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution of modern mobile terminals, social networks, and other intelligent services makes everyone become a ubiquitous information perceiver, producer, and propagator. Also known as "social sensor" and "social IoT", these individuals and communities generate a huge volume of social signals, which has shown prominent value for mining. These unstructured social signals provide a new perspective in the research of complex systems, which makes the traditional cyber-physical system (CPS)-oriented information computing sublimate to the cyber-physical-social system (CPSS)-oriented knowledge computing. However, there still exist great uncertainties, ambiguities, and complexities in modeling behaviors of social individuals or groups. Especially when we apply big-data-driven learning-based models in specific fields and scenarios, the lack of domain expert knowledge and characteristics of system uncertainty severely limits the performance and accuracy of these models. The introduction of fuzzy system modeling integrates data and knowledge in the social computing area, which has shown its unique advantages in solving the above issues and has drawn more attention to this topic. In this article, we conduct a review of recent advances in social computing with fuzzy technologies in CPSS. First, we briefly review the development of social computing, and analyze the characteristics and advantages of social computing through fuzzy methods. Second, we refine core fuzzy system methods for social computing and elaborate on existing fuzzy-technology-empowered social computing methodologies. As in a range of social spaces, we also review and analyze related advances in human-in-the-loop systems. We also reveal the trend of decentralized, autonomous, and organized computing in cyber-physical-social space with fuzzy-based methods and proposed a framework to categorize related studies in CPSS. Finally, we conclude the research trends and hotspots based on current studies, and discuss the challenges for future research directions.

AB  - Industry 4.0 is initiated by the German government as a high level technology strategy in order to keep Germany in a global leading position in manufacturing, also intends to solve energy and aging issues in parallel. Germany has proposed the "Reference Architecture Model Industries 4.0" which is based on the regulations published by the International Electrotechnical Commission. The manifestation of Industry 4.0 can be achieved by the realization of digital factory. And it's emphasized on total integration with Cyber Physical System as its core technology, via Internet of Things to realize the operational environment of human machine interaction, and the utilization of Big Data for decision making. The research motivation of this thesis is to utilize Totally Integrated Automation Portal as a digital factory software development platform, to achieve the fundamental educational requirements of digital factory, and to understand Industry 4.0 concept. Methodology of this research is based on a set of experimental and training mechanism, the sequence of machine movements is controlled by a Programmable Logic Controller, and this PLC has to be complied with IEC61131 International Standard. Regarding communication technology also to be complied with IEC61158 and IEC62541 e.g. PROFINET and OPC UA protocol. And finally realizing the operational environment of human machine interaction via smart phone according to the outcome of this research, it has been shown that total integration concept can be realized by single production machine. By standardization of factory environment and increasing the level of operational environment of human machine interaction, productivity and quality of production could be significantly increased. PLC could be used to analyze intelligent platform and comply with the Industry 4.0 standard at the same time. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Iterative-type evaluation of PSGS fuzzy systems for anytime use
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - While fuzzy systems can advantageously be used in system modeling and control, their use in time-critical applications is limited because of complexity problems, especially in cases when not only low, but also flexibly changeable complexity is needed. Previously, a method has been proposed to use fuzzy and other soft-computational tools in the frame of modular anytime architectures; however, the applicability needs the a priori knowledge of the temporarily available time and resources. This paper proposes a new transformation method, which makes possible the iterative-type evaluation of product-sum-gravity-singleton (PSGS) fuzzy systems, with a really flexibly changeable complexity, and with an easily estimable error at any step of the evaluation. Moreover, the transformation also ensures the fastest possible decrease of the error.

AB  - A novel cellular learning automaton traffic flow model is proposed to solve the problem that the probability of randomization in the NaSch model is not consistent with the actual traffic. The learning mechanism is introduced in this model. Cellular can learn traffic information from cellular neighbors in real time. The traffic environment information, such as, relative speed and safety distance will be cellular parallel ruler through the randomization probability form after learning. Finally through numerical simulation, the space-time characteristics were obtained, and comparison with the NaSch model is analyzed. The results show that the improved model can reduce the blocking the road to a certain extent and traffic jam dissolving efficiency is higher. The stability analysis of vehicle running from two aspects of speed fluctuation and headway fluctuation shows that the method in this paper can make traffic flow more stable.

M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are characterized by extremely tight integration of and coordination between computational and physical resources. CPS integrate computation, communication, and storage capabilities through systems of systems that must interact with the physical world in real-time at multiple time scales and often at multiple spatial scales. The inherent heterogeneity and the non-deterministic operation of different components in these systems pose new challenges to traditional control, communication, real-time scheduling, and robotics disciplines.In conjunction with the IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium in 2009 (RTSS 2009), this project helps to support a Ph.D. student forum to discuss (i) the set of interdisciplinary research problems that arise in the context of cyber-physical systems, (ii) novel applications that become possible thanks to the integration of computing, communication, and interaction with the physical world at scale, and (iii) initial system architecture that addresses some of these research problems. The primary goal is to help students (and the real-time community) recognize that cyberphysical systems are different from the over-engineered real-time embedded systems of the past, and to provide a forum by which students can discuss their proposal for addressing the complicated aggregate systems issues that arise in this context. As such, we need to encourage constructive debate on emerging research topics. A secondary goal is to encourage student involvement in new research directions and offer a channel to discuss and reward the most innovative student ideas in this exciting emerging research field. Advisors and students will be welcome to attend the forum, but the focus will be on training and motivating the next generation of researchers.

TI  - Assessing the Risk of Software Development in Agile Methodologies Using Simulation
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agile methodologies aim to reduce software development risk using short iterations, feature-driven development, continuous integration, testing automation, and other practices. However, the risk of project failure or time and budget overruns is still a relevant problem. This paper aims to present and discuss a new approach to model some key risk factors in agile development, using software process simulation modeling (SPSM), which can complement other approaches, and whose usage is particularly suited for agile development. We introduce a new approach to modeling some key risk factors - namely project duration, number of implemented issues, and key statistics of issue completion time - using a simulator of agile development, which we developed for this purpose. The approach includes modeling the agile process, gathering data from the tool used for project management, and performing Monte Carlo simulations of the process, to get insights about the expected time and effort to complete the project, and about their distributions. The model's parameters that can cause risk are errors in effort estimation of the features to develop, variations in developers' assignment to these features, impediments related to developers' availability and work completion. To validate the simulator, and to demonstrate how the method can be used, we analyzed three open-source projects, gathering their data from JIRA repositories. We ran Monte Carlo simulations of these projects, showing that the simulator can well approximate the progress of the real project, then varying the identified risk factors and statistically evaluating their effects on the risk parameters. The proposed approach is relevant for project managers, being able to quantitatively evaluate the risks, provided that the process and the project's data are properly modeled and gathered. As for the future, we are working to improve our risk assessment method, evaluating it on more case studies, scaling the model from a single team to multiple teams involved in one or more projects.

AB  - Even though model-driven engineering reduces complexity during the development of self-adaptive systems and models@run.time enables using them during runtime, connecting models to different external systems still involves manual work. Those connections are essential to the complete system, as they enable external systems to react to changes in the internal model and vice versa. In our case, the model is based on Relational Reference Attribute Grammars, an extension of Attribute Grammars to enable conceptual models at runtime while retaining their benefits of modular specification and an incremental evaluation scheme. We present an approach to enable concise specification of the causal connection and needed transformations to match required formats or semantics. To show its applicability, a case study showing the coordination of multiple industrial robot arms using models is presented. We show that using our approach, connections can be specified more concisely while maintaining the same efficiency as hand-written code. The artefact comprising all source code and an executable version of the case studies is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7009758.

CP  - 16th European Simulation Multiconference (ESM 2002)
CL  - UNIV APPL SCI, DARMSTADT, GERMANY
AB  - With increasing importance of modeling and simulation (M&S), the need for ensuring the correctness and appropriateness of M&S becomes stronger. The methodology of Verification and Validation (V&V) of M&S provides several powerful approaches for the evaluation of correctness and appropriateness, and therefore for increasing the credibility of an M&S. However, the intended purpose of the M&S application, the application domain and the available knowledge in this domain, and the actually chosen technical implementation heavily influence the applicable V&V methods and techniques.The High Level Architecture (HLA) provides a framework for the coupling of several simulators (federates) to create a simulation federation. But not always each federate has been developed in a well structured, clearly documented way, and not always the federation has been developed in accordance to the Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP), and then the basis for meaningful V&V is small.After the identification of all information that an HLA-compliant simulation model must provide to qualify as an HLA federate, this paper explores the potentials of Propositional Linear Temporal Logic (PLTL) for the specification of desired federation behavior. Then an approach of how to create an output sequences acceptance checker (Buchi Automaton) for automatic, non-exhaustive behavior verification is presented. The paper concludes with the identification of additional information requirements that the federates and the federation need to satisfy, to allow true exhaustive model checking of HLA federations.

TI  - Enhancing learning experience in physical action-orientated learning factories using a virtually extended environment and serious gaming approaches
T2  - 7TH CONFERENCE ON LEARNING FACTORIES (CLF 2017)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Conference on Learning Factories (CLF)
CL  - Darmstadt, GERMANY
AB  - Development and implementation of new paradigms such as cyber-physical as well as lean and green production systems lead to higher degrees of system dependencies and complexity. Learning factories are a possible solution to convey the knowledge for new paradigms. Since exclusively physical learning factories provide a realistic learning experience on a low level - including product, machine and process view - new paradigms require an extended system perspective. To enable learners to understand how changes to production systems might not only affect neighboring production systems, but also building services, maintenance activities, up-and downstream supply chains and even product life cycle, the authors propose a virtually extended environment tightly intertwined with the physical learning factory. Embedded in a business game, the learners interact within the hybrid physical-virtual learning factory. Technical and organizational changes can be applied to the learning factory to solve given tasks. To overcome physically limited possibilities, these changes might not only be physical, but also virtual. Subsequent long-term simulations ascertain how changes affect key figures on management and supply chain level. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - MC-SDN: Supporting Mixed-Criticality Real-Time Communication Using Software-Defined Networking
T2  - IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite recent advances, there still remain many problems to design reliable cyber-physical systems. One of the typical problems is to achieve a seemingly conflicting goal, which is to support timely delivery of real-time flows while improving resource efficiency. Recently, the concept of mixed-criticality (MC) has been widely accepted as useful in addressing the goal for real-time resource management. However, it has not been yet studied well for real-time communication. In this paper, we present the first approach to support MC flow scheduling on switched Ethernet networks leveraging an emerging network architecture, software-defined networking (SDN). Though SDN provides flexible and programmatic ways to control packet forwarding and scheduling, it yet raises several challenges to enable real-time MC flow scheduling on SDN, including: 1) how to handle (i. e., drop or re-prioritize) out-of-mode packets in the middle of the network when the criticality mode changes and 2) how the mode change affects end-to-end transmission delays. Addressing such challenges, we develop MC-SDN that supports real-time MC flow scheduling by extending SDN-enabled switches and OpenFlow protocols. It manages and schedules MC packets in different ways depending on the system criticality mode. To this end, we carefully design the mode change protocol that provides analytic mode change delay bound, and then resolve implementation issues for system architecture. For evaluation, we implement a prototype of MC-SDN on top of Open vSwitch, and integrate it into a real world network testbed as well as a 1/10 autonomous vehicle. Our extensive evaluations with the network testbed and vehicle deployment show that MC-SDN supports MC flow scheduling with minimal delays on forwarding rule updates and it brings a significant improvement in safety in a real-world application scenario.

TI  - Towards a domain-specific information architecture enabling the investigation and optimization of flexible production systems by utilizing artificial intelligence
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The industrial domain is undergoing a major transformation, pushed forward by emerging technologies originating from research or industry. The resulting trend, better known by the term Industry 4.0, advances automation within these manufacturing companies by providing ubiquitous interconnection. This enables the integration of technologies mainly used in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) or Big Data with the goal to optimize production processes or facilitate intelligent decision-making. While those processes are progressively supported by methodologies coming from the area of artificial intelligence (AI) like machine learning algorithms, sustainable and consistent storing of production data becomes increasingly important. Concluding, production systems engineering and information engineering are correlating with each other, as the respective results could be used to the advantage of the respective other discipline. In order to address these issues while developing such flexible production systems, the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) has been introduced. However, practical applications are lacking as this standard is mainly described in theory, which makes it difficult to actually apply this framework. Thus, the main goal of this paper is to specify a detailed architecture description of the Information Layer to ensure the practical application of RAMI 4.0, which allows stakeholders to utilize model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) for developing data aspects of industrial systems on the one hand and enable Information Engineering on the other hand. Supported by the concept of the Zachman Framework, the resulting architecture is applied and validated with the help of a real-world case study.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Deep-Learning-Based Algal Bloom Prediction for Lake Okeechobee Using Multisource Data Fusion
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on predicting harmful algal bloom (HAB) events in Lake Okeechobee, a shallow lake in Florida. A spatiotemporal deep learning model is employed to predict the levels of cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa present in the lake for a single-day and a 14-day prediction horizon. Datasets collected from remote sensing (i.e., satellite images from January 2018 to December 2020) and from a physics-based simulation model (i.e., daily simulation from January 2018 to December 2020) are available. Owing to the low quality of remote sensing data caused by various environmental and technical issues, the two available datasets are fused together to create a multisource hybrid dataset for deep learning model training. A convolutional long-short term memory (ConvLSTM) deep neural model is trained on the datasets, and the results of the predictions are compared to the true cyanobacterial index for that time period. Findings include the following: 1) the deep learning model, ConvLSTM, shows promising performance for short- and mid-term HAB forecasting; and 2) the hybrid dataset that fuses remote sensing with physics-based modeling (a.k.a. modeling based on fundamental physical and biogeochemical principles) speeds up the model learning and improves its performance significantly. The proposed methodologies are reliable and cost-effective and could be used to forecast algal bloom occurrences in shallow lakes with limited sparse observations.

TI  - A service-oriented framework for agent-based simulations of collaborative supply chains
T2  - COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current collaborative practices of supply chain management are limited, to some known configurations where a dominant member sets the pace for the collaboration extent, Extending collaborative models to supply chains without a dominant member requires defining a fair assessment of costs and benefits and how they are distributed among members. To understand collaborative models and their mechanisms, simulation-based approaches are recommended as they can afford the complexity of real scenarios. However, building ad-hoc simulation models for studying complex supply chain interactions can be prohibitive in terms of both cost and time. Therefore, the availability of simulation frameworks, to be used easily by business managers and facilitating the development of those models, has a strong incentive in the quest of current business efforts to increase their supply chain performance. The objective of this work is to present a systematic and reusable serviceoriented framework for agent based simulation to support the analysis of collaborative interactions in supply chains. Results of a requirement analysis performed to this aim are described, and the fulfillment of identified requirements by the proposed framework, and capabilities thereof, are discussed.

M3  - Article
AB  - The fast progress in hardware technology for parallel computing has not always been accompanied by equivalent progress in software development, although in certain applications (matrix calculations, weather forecasts, ... ) a linear or even hyper-proportional speedup with respect to the number of processors has been demonstrated. At first sight, the simulation of complex communication networks with its many concurrent activities seems to be well suited for parallel computing. In the 70s first proposals on extending the principles of discrete event simulation to distributed simulation have been made. Since then research focussed on the study of clock control mechanisms for closely and loosely coupled parallel systems. Recently a parallel simulator employing a special clock synchronization has been built where the synchronization mechanism 'time warp' is embedded in a dedicated integrated circuit.The emerging broadband communication networks based on the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) pose new challenges on simulation techniques. There are different control mechanisms working at different timescales to be covered in one simulation model and, also, cell losses as rare events to be investigated.This contribution begins with an overview of the evolution of distributed simulation techniques for discrete event systems. It discusses at which modelling level a parallelization of simulation tasks is possible. Then the typical behaviour of broadband subscribers with a variable bitrate is presented. Finally we discuss the feasibility of the presented simulation techniques to study the hard requirements for the quality of service in ATM networks.

TI  - A framework for Virtual Interactive Construction Education (VICE)
T2  - AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Training and process analysis in the construction industry has not taken full advantage of new technologies in simulation, modeling, and semantic web and software engineering. The purpose of this research is to develop a framework for a virtual interactive construction education system taking full advantage of these technologies. The modules will simulate the construction process for a facility from start to finish using information drawn from domain experts using real projects in the built environment. These modules can be used as training tools for new employees where they attempt to optimize time and cost in a virtual environment given a limited number of equipment, time and employee options. They can also be used as a process analysis tool before, during and after construction where a number of situational variables could be analyzed for exposure of potential risk. These modules would be particularly useful for repetitive construction where the initial project or task is analyzed for optimization and risk mitigation. This paper describes the framework using a residential construction example that is a 900 square foot (about 85 m(2)) wood frame single family house designed for the United States.

AB  - Current software development practices are increasingly based on using both COTS and legacy components which make such systems prone to security vulnerabilities. The modern practice addressing ever changing conditions, DevOps, promotes frequent software deliveries, however, verification methods artifacts should be updated in a timely fashion to cope with the pace of the process. VeriDevOps, Horizon 2020 project, aims at providing a faster feedback loop for verifying the security requirements and other quality attributes of large scale cyber-physical systems. VeriDevOps focuses on optimizing the security verification activities, by automatically creating verifiable models directly from security requirements formulated in natural language, using these models to check security properties on design models and then generating artefacts such as, tests or monitors that can be used later in the DevOps process. The main drivers for these advances are: Natural Language Processing, a combined formal verification and model-based testing approach, and machine-learning-based security monitors. VeriDevOps is in its initial stage - the project started on 1.10.2020 and it will run for three years. In this paper we will present the major conceptual ideas behind the project approach as well as the organizational settings.

AB  - Safety-critical systems are designed to operate millions of hours without losing or harming life. Millions of hours enable events with small occurrence probability to materialise. Owing to this, rare events have to be factored when designing for millions of safe operating hours. In this paper, we apply a statistical paradigm named Extreme Value analysis for the modeling of the rare events and probabilistic risk assessment. Without loss of generality, our motivation is cyber-physical-systems where the IT infrastructure is frequently shared between functionally independent tasks and the run-time platform, such as Industry 4.0 based on 5G and edge cloud computing.As a practical example, we present our method on a case study on a typical micro-service-based edge computing setup by measuring and analysing the container restart times in Kubernetes. The results can be used to asses and compare resilience mechanism design alternatives.

AB  - We present ThingFlow, a software architecture to write event-processing pipelines for Internet-of-things (IoT) applications. Such applications typically involve sensing, stateful transformations of event streams, state estimation, and control/actuation, learning, and data analytics. They are currently programmed using a zoo of languages, systems, and APIs with ad hoc data passing protocols.ThingFlow provides three abstractions: sensors which can sample changing physical values, streams of (potentially real-valued) data, and stateful filters, which transform input streams to output streams, and can be composed. ThingFlow programs consist of compositions of filters scheduled and run by an explicit, asynchronous, scheduler. ThingFlow is implemented as a Python API whose core is compact enough to run on very limited microcontrollers such as the ESP8266, while providing support for sensors, message streams over the network, machine learning, and cloud backends. We show the expressiveness, versatility, and simplicity of ThingFlow on a number of examples from the IoT domain, incorporating sensing, filtering, actuation, data analysis, and learning.

AB  - Modeling a complex system is a daunting task for students as several perspectives need to be employed at varying resolution levels. Students need to abstract a real system, understand the system entities, their interactions, and the effects these interactions have on system properties. In addition, students need to validate and evaluate their models. As such, teaching modeling and simulation of complex systems requires an in-depth understanding of the challenges faced by students in order to design the best learning experience. In this paper, we explore the reflections of 24 students after submitting two modeling and simulation assignments in a complex systems course. We identify that students struggle with the chosen simulation tool, as expected, but also that focusing on system entities and their interaction is not straightforward due to several system complexities and learning barriers. We discuss three course design principles to address these barriers, focused on scaffolded tool introduction, abstraction introduction, and mastery learning.

TI  - SmAuto: A domain-specific-language for application development in smart environments
T2  - PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - A common problem in the development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) applications is the complexity of these domains, due to their hybrid and distributed nature in multiple layers (hardware, network, communication, application etc.). Apart from other issues, this inherent complexity often gives room for implementation errors, which can be in many cases fatal and drive the application and/or the system to undesired states. The current work aspires to alleviate this problem by introducing a low-code approach for building IoT and CPS applications. We argue that, through the proposed approach it is possible to lower development time and risk (errors/bug-related ones) and allow a wide range of endusers to build and monitor applications for state-of-the-art domains, such as smart home and smart industry. In this context, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approaches are explored and SmAuto, a Domain-specific Language (DSL) is proposed for creating and executing automation tasks for smart environments. Through SmAuto it is possible to handle the heterogeneity and complexity issues of the IoT and CPS domains, this way allowing end-users are non-technical application experts to build well-designed and properly functioning smart applications. The proposed DSL implements a Sense-Think-Act-Communicate model for smart environments and enables the creation, validation, and dynamic execution of composite automation models in physical, virtual and hybrid environments, while it also enables automated code generation of virtual entities for verification purposes. By using layered abstractions to automate the development process, end-users can concentrate on the real problem instead of dwelling into technical details, thus increasing their productivity. The results of the empirical evaluation and the comparison to existing approaches show that SmAuto can make application development more rigorous, improves productivity of end-users including non-experts, i.e. citizen developers and satisfies several functional and non-functional requirements of modern DSLs, such as tool support, modular deployment, reusability, availability and extensibility.

T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Emergent Software Systems (ESSs) are designed to reduce the initial effort in creating autonomous solutions and fully adaptive support systems that can autonomously learn the system's structure and operating environment without predefined knowledge. These models notably minimize/exclude the involvement of developers in the composition, maintenance, and evolution of software systems. Despite extensive research on self-adaptive systems, systematic reviews focusing specifically on ESSs are lacking. This paper addresses this gap by performing a systematic literature review on ESSs. Our goal is to equip researchers and industry practitioners with a comprehensive view of existing ESSs, enabling them to select approaches that meet their requirements and identify potential research avenues. The research questions are centered around knowing what ESSs are and identifying the set of activities essential for their creation. From an initial collection of 496 papers identified through search engines, 39 papers met our inclusion and exclusion criteria for retention and in-depth analysis. Finally, we build a taxonomy to categorize existing ESS approaches and dissect various ESS definitions to pinpoint their main characteristics. The taxonomy is structured around the goals, processes and usability of ESSs. Our research reveals an emphasis on non-functional adaptation objectives within current ESSs. Despite this focus, the majority of existing ESSs are still in the proof-of-concept phase and have undergone minimal testing in industrial settings. While present ESS investigations largely revolve around areas such as web service computing, internet of things, and cyber-physical systems, we advocate for further exploration of their potential utility in other application domains such as robotics, aerospace, and unmanned vehicles.

AB  - The automatic generation of software models is an important element in many software and systems engineering scenarios such as software tool certification, validation of cyber-physical systems, or benchmarking graph databases. Several model generators are nowadays available, but the topic of whether they generate realistic models has been little studied. The state-of-the-art approach to check the realistic property in software models is to rely on simple comparisons using graph metrics and statistics. This generates a bottleneck due to the compression of all the information contained in the model into a small set of metrics. Furthermore, there is a lack of interpretation in these approaches since there are no hints of why the generated models are not realistic. Therefore, in this paper, we tackle the problem of assessing how realistic a generator is by mapping it to a classification problem in which a Graph Neural Network (GNN) will be trained to distinguish between the two sets of models (real and synthetic ones). Then, to assess how realistic a generator is we perform the Classifier Two-Sample Test (C2ST). Our approach allows for interpretation of the results by inspecting the attention layer of the GNN. We use our approach to assess four state-of-the-art model generators applied to three different domains. The results show that none of the generators can be considered realistic.

Unfortunately, as the interconnectivity among them increases, so do the opportunities for malicious users to target them. Hence, it is necessary to increase the security of these systems and their components. A wide range of security solutions (e.g., industrial Firewalls) are already an integral part of Industrial Automation Systems, however, these are deployed at strategical system locations and might not be capable of identifying intrusions that target specific elements of embedded industrial devices. Host Intrusion Detection Systems (Host IDS) are one security solution that allow to detect such type of intrusions, as they analyze information related to specific host devices. This contribution presents a feasible Host IDS architecture for embedded industrial devices. This architecture takes into consideration features and capabilities of Host IDS from the IT domain. It also considers system-, environmentaland device-specific properties from the industrial domain. These properties are presented in the form of abstracted requirements and considerations that are contemplated for the conceptualization of the presented architecture. Furthermore, the feasibility of this architecture is validated through the implementation and evaluation of a prototypical Host IDS deployed in a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) hosting a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). This evaluation is achieved through the demonstration of a set of hypotheses derived from the abstracted requirements and supported by the evaluation of test scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully operational Host IDS to be deployed and evaluated on a PLC. (C) 2019 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gigantic rates of data production in the era of Big Data, Internet of Thing (IoT), and Smart Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) pose incessantly escalating demands for massive data processing, storage, and transmission while continuously interacting with the physical world using edge sensors and actuators. For IoT systems, there is now a strong trend to move the intelligence from the cloud to the edge or the extreme edge (known as TinyML). Yet, this shift to edge Al systems requires to design powerful machine learning systems under very strict resource constraints. This poses a difficult design task that needs to take the complete system stack from machine learning algorithm, to model optimization and compression, to software implementation, to hardware platform and ML accelerator design into account. This paper discusses the open research challenges to achieve such a holistic Design Space Exploration for a HW/SW Co-design for Edge AI Systems and discusses the current state with three currently developed flows: one design flow for systems with tightly-coupled accelerator architectures based on RISC-V, one approach using loosely-coupled, application-specific accelerators as well as one framework that integrates software and hardware optimization techniques to built efficient Deep Neural Network (DNN) systems.

AB  - With the rapid growth and integration in technology and information, the behavior and structure of complex systems presents escalating challenges. Complex systems are marked by high level of ambiguity, uncertainty, and emergence. These conditions impose challenges and difficulties for practitioners responsible to successfully manage and design complex systems. There is a fundamental need to have a cadre of individuals who are capable of dealing with increasingly complex systems and their problems. One response is Systems Thinking, which can provide a holistic thinking paradigm that opens new channels and opportunities to think differently about complex systems as a whole unit. This paradigm will enable individuals to avoid solving the wrong problems. The emphasis of this paper is to explore possible applications of a research-based instrument developed to capture the level of systems thinking for individuals who engage and design complex systems. The Systems Thinking Profiles produced by the instrument represent individual inclination to adapt a systemic perspective for engaging and solving complex system problems, and reflects a state that can be enhanced through training and/or education to improve capacity for systems thinking.

AB  - Robotic surgical systems are among the most complex medical cyber-physical systems on the market. Despite significant improvements in design of those systems through the years, there have been ongoing occurrences of safety incidents that negatively impact patients during procedures. This paper presents an approach for systems-theoretic safety assessment of robotic tele-surgical systems using software-implemented fault injection. We used a systems-theoretic hazard analysis technique (STPA) to identify the potential safety hazard scenarios and their contributing causes in RAVEN II, an open-source telerobotic surgical platform. We integrated the robot control software with a software-implemented fault injection engine that measures the resilience of system to the identified hazard scenarios by automatically inserting faults into different parts of the software. Representative hazard scenarios from real robotic surgery incidents reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) MAUDE database were used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach for safety-based design of robotic telesurgical systems.

AB  - The objective of the hArtes (Holistic Approach to Reconfigurable real Time Embedded Systems) is to provide a toot set that facilitates the management of entire design flow Despite of its improved design productivity, the two bottleneck are: (1) capturing initial application specifications in the specified graphical tool and (2) Cycle accurate performance estimation in design space exploration.We propose: (1) a transformation methodology for converting reference sequential C code to data-flow specifications and (2) a design space exploration framework based on cycle accurate performance estimation. The proposed transformation methodology is based on functions re-organization and variables definitions. The proposed design space exploration framework consists of two design loops: computational architecture selection loop and communication architecture selection loop. Before entering into these loops, it is critical to estimate the performance of application function blocks. We propose a performance estimation methodology by performing simulations at CABA (Cycle Accurate Bit Accurate) level. Instead of simulating the entire application, each function block is instrumented and executed oil the target simulation platform and the resulting information is stored in a performance estimation library.Experimentation with H.264 video encoding application proves the viability of the proposed transformation methodology. Validation and performance evaluations for performance estimation technique are done by extending the SoCLib library of simulation models.

TI  - Rapid synthesis of high-level architecture-based heterogeneous simulation: a model-based integration approach
T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Virtual evaluation of complex command and control concepts demands the use of heterogeneous simulation environments. Development challenges include how to integrate multiple simulation engines with varying semantics and how to integrate simulation models and manage the complex interactions between them. While existing simulation frameworks may provide many of the required run-time services needed to coordinate among multiple simulation engines, they lack an overarching integration approach that connects and relates the interoperability of heterogeneous domain models and their interactions. This paper outlines some of the challenges encountered in developing a command and control simulation environment and discusses our use of the Generic Modeling Environment tool suite to create a model-based integration approach that allows for rapid synthesis of complex high-level architecture-based simulation environments.

TI  - Software Verification and Validation of Safe Autonomous Cars: A Systematic Literature Review
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Review
AB  - Autonomous, or self-driving, cars are emerging as the solution to several problems primarily caused by humans on roads, such as accidents and traffic congestion. However, those benefits come with great challenges in the verification and validation (V&V) for safety assessment. In fact, due to the possibly unpredictable nature of Artificial Intelligence (AI), its use in autonomous cars creates concerns that need to be addressed using appropriate V&V processes that can address trustworthy AI and safe autonomy. In this study, the relevant research literature in recent years has been systematically reviewed and classified in order to investigate the state-of-the-art in the software V&V of autonomous cars. By appropriate criteria, a subset of primary studies has been selected for more in-depth analysis. The first part of the review addresses certification issues against reference standards, challenges in assessing machine learning, as well as general V&V methodologies. The second part investigates more specific approaches, including simulation environments and mutation testing, corner cases and adversarial examples, fault injection, software safety cages, techniques for cyber-physical systems, and formal methods. Relevant approaches and related tools have been discussed and compared in order to highlight open issues and opportunities.

AB  - This paper describes a new two-quarter undergraduate capstone design class in our computer engineering curriculum, Design groups comprised of students from several different areas of specialization [e.g., software systems, very large scale integration (VLSI) devices and circuits, and computer architecture] design, simulate, implement, and evaluate a complete computing system. Typical examples of projects in the current sequence include a pipelined 32-bit RISC processor, a four-cell systolic array processor, and a video game. The goal is to produce simulation and hardware/software codesign as early as possible in the design process. Students execute software on simulation models prior to any hardware implementation. An assembler and a compiler are developed for the new design. Throughout the sequence, students participate in design reviews and must provide documentation of their designs. The final designs are implemented using an array of field programmable gate arrays (FPGA's) contained in a device called a hardware emulator. This allows for ease of design modifications while still having actual hardware for experimentation.

AB  - Discrete Event Simulation is a widely used technique that is used to model and analyze complex systems in many fields of science and engineering. The increasingly large size of simulation models poses a serious computational challenge, since the time needed to run a simulation can be prohibitively large. For this reason, Parallel and Distributes Simulation techniques have been proposed to take advantage of multiple execution units which are found in multicore processors, cluster of workstations or HPC systems. The current generation of HPC systems includes hundreds of thousands of computing nodes and a vast amount of ancillary components. Despite improvements in manufacturing processes, failures of some components are frequent, and the situation will get worse as larger systems are built. In this paper we describe FT-GAIA, a software-based fault-tolerant extension of the GAIA/ART` IS parallel simulation middleware. FT-GAIA transparently replicates simulation entities and distributes them on multiple execution nodes. This allows the simulation to tolerate crash-failures of computing nodes; furthermore, FT-GAIA offers some protection against Byzantine failures since synchronization messages are replicated as well, so that the receiving entity can identify and discard corrupted messages. We provide an experimental evaluation of FT-GAIA on a running prototype. Results show that a high degree of fault tolerance can be achieved, at the cost of a moderate increase in the computational load of the execution units.

AB  - In this paper, we describe a simulation based health monitoring system test-bed for an electrical power distribution system developed at the Integrated Vehicle Health Management Centre, Cranfield University. The purpose of the test-bed is to provide a technology neutral basis for implementing and evaluation diagnostic systems and software architecture in support the condition based maintenance process. The paper describes real-time system architecture and concept of operations for the electrical power system test-bed. The four main components in the real-time test-bed are the electrical power system simulation model, fault insertion unit, health monitoring data processing and user interface. In this paper, we adopted a component based modelling paradigm for the implementation of the virtual electrical power system. All of the fault injections are currently implemented via software. The fault insertion unit allows for the repeatable injection of faults into the system. The qualitative/discrete model-based diagnostic reasoning approach is applied to the health monitoring process of the test-bed. The finite/discrete nature of the reasoning engine allows efficient and fast execution time in the diagnostic process. The experimental results show the health monitoring system is able to produce real-time performance and correct diagnostic assessments.

TI  - An Evaluation Process for IoT Platforms in Time-Sensitive Domains
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the temporal behavior of an IoT platform is of utmost importance as IoT systems are time-sensitive. IoT platforms play a central role in the operation of an IoT system, impacting the overall performance. As a result, initiating an IoT project without the exhaustive knowledge of such a core software piece may lead to a failed project if the finished systems do not meet the needed temporal response and scalability levels. Despite this fact, existing works on IoT software systems focus on the design and implementation of a particular system, providing a final evaluation as the validation. This is a risky approach as an incorrect decision on the core IoT platform may involve great monetary loss if the final evaluation proves that the system does not meet the expected validation criteria. To overcome this, we provide an evaluation process to determine the temporal behavior of IoT platforms to support early design decisions with respect to the appropriateness of the particular platform in its application as an IoT project. The process defines the steps towards the early evaluation of IoT platforms, ranging from the identification of the potential software items and the determination of the validation criteria to running the experiments and obtaining results. The process is exemplified on an exhaustive evaluation of a particular mainstream IoT platform for the case of a medical system for patient monitoring. In this time-sensitive scenario, results report the temporal behavior of the platform regarding the validation parameters expressed at the initial steps.

AB  - Future network systems are expected to have various levels of adaptation capabilities: at parametric level, service-level, and application-level. These capabilities are often realized in multiple system layers, with the control logic needed for a specific capability residing in the application agents interfacing with the underlying network system services. We employ a software cybernetics approach, where an intelligent physical system module (IPW) embodies the core adaptation functionality to respond to the changing environment conditions and user inputs. The IPW exhibits an intelligent behavior over a limited operating region of the system. And, it is augmented by a supervisory module (ICW) that houses external feedback loops for situational assessment of the changing environment conditions. Our autonomic management of various hierarchical control loops comes under the ambit of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The ICW patches the IPW with suitable control parameters and rules/ procedures when the system operating conditions change. The paper illuminates our concept of IPW with a software engineering-oriented case study of multi-source video transfer over a bandwidth-limited network path.

T2  - POWER CONTROL AND OPTIMIZATION
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 3rd Global Conference on Power Control and Optimization
CL  - Gold Coast, AUSTRALIA
AB  - The system dynamics approach is a holistic way of solving problems in real-time scenarios. This is a powerful methodology and computer simulation modeling technique for framing, analyzing, and discussing complex issues and problems. System dynamics modeling and simulation is often the background of a systemic thinking approach and has become a management and organizational development paradigm. This paper proposes a system dynamics approach for study the importance of infrastructure facilities on quality of primary education system in developing nations. The model is proposed to be built using the Cross Impact Analysis (CIA) method of relating entities and attributes relevant to the primary education system in any given community. We offer a survey to build the cross-impact correlation matrix and, hence, to better understand the primary education system and importance of infrastructural facilities on quality of primary education. The resulting model enables us to predict the effects of infrastructural facilities on the access of primary education by the community. This may support policy makers to take more effective actions in campaigns.

AB  - Highly customized products dominate in the mechanical engineering industry. Products like machine tools, food processing or packaging machines are characterized by a high complexity, a low quantity and a long-term machine life. This leads to a high number of variants and project specific modules and components. High efforts during order fulfillment processes occur. The development of mechanical embossed products to Cyber-Physical Systems reinforces the difficulties of the mechanical engineering industry. The interdisciplinary approaches of Systems Engineering and Model-Based Systems Engineering are suitable to improve order fulfillment processes. Therefore we introduce an approach to improve order fulfillment processes with Model-Based Systems Engineering. Our results meet the challenges of the mechanical engineering industry as follows: creating a domain-spanning description of the system and the business process to gain a common understanding; optimizing the system architecture by defining mechatronic modules; improving the sustainable communication within the company and with customers by training courses and tool support. The results are validated by a practical example.

TI  - Design and development of a service-oriented wrapper system for sharing and reusing distributed geoanalysis models on the web
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Geoanalysis models are an abstraction and expression of geographic phenomena and processes which are associated to environmental issues. Such models continue to be created in many different domains, and collaborative modeling and simulation using models in the open web environment is becoming popular for geographic and environmental research. Service-oriented sharing and reusing of distributed geoanalysis models is an important foundation of this type of work. However, service-oriented modeling faces several challenges, especially associated with reusing heterogeneous geo-simulation model resources. This paper builds on research related to creating, managing, and publishing plug-and-play model services, with the aim to design and develop a web-based wrapper system for geoanalysis models that acts as a service loader and manager to publish these models as services to users. Our wrapper system can accomplish functions such as standardizing model preparation workflows, managing model services, and invoking interactive model services, thus bridging the gap between geo-simulation resource contributors and service users. We use the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and the Unstructured Grid Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) as case studies to show that the developed wrapper system can readily and efficiently enable sharing of model resources and can contribute to collaborative modeling and simulation for environment across a network.

TI  - Semiconductor Manufacturing Final Test Yield Optimization and Wafer Acceptance Test Parameter Inverse Design Using Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithms
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the semiconductor industry, many previous optimization studies have been carried out at the integrated circuit front-end design phase to identify optimal circuit elements' size and design parameters. With the scaling of device dimensions, semiconductor manufacturing back-end Final Test (FT) yield is increasingly influenced by systematic or random process variations. As a result, the FT yield is not fully guaranteed by design phase optimization due to existing limitations of yield simulation models and coverage. Very few studies have attempted to incorporate the production FT yield data into process variation optimization and inverse design. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for FT yield optimization and Wafer Acceptance Test (WAT) parameter inverse design using multi-objective optimization algorithms. This provides a solution to monitor and quickly adjust process variations to maximize FT yield without expensive characterization or design correction after products are released into the production phase. Both yield optimization and process shift feasibility are to be taken into consideration by formulating these factors into a two objective optimization problem. One objective is to minimize FT yield loss, wherein the yield loss is predicted by a machine learning model. The other objective is to minimize the total WAT parameters shift distance from the current standard setting. Three widely used multi-objective algorithms NSGA-II, SMPSO and GDE3 are applied, compared and discussed. An automatic parameter tuning approach using Sequential Model-based Algorithm Configuration (SMAC) and entropy-based termination criterion is applied to reduce the execution time whilst maintaining the optimization algorithms' performance. Real production data for CMOS 55nm chip are used to validate the framework and the results point to the effectiveness of yield improvement and accurate identification of the optimal WAT parameter combination.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Self-adaptivity enables flexible solutions in dynamically changing environments. However, due to the increasing complexity, uncertainty, and topology changes in cyber-physical systems (CPS), static adaptation mechanisms are insufficient as they do not always achieve appropriate effects. Furthermore, CPS are used in safety-critical domains, which requires them and their autonomous adaptations to be dependable. To overcome these problems, we extend the MAPE-K feedback loop architecture by imposing a structure and requirements on the knowledge base and by Introducing a meta-adaptation layer. This enables us to continuously evaluate the accuracy of previous adaptations, learn new adaptation rules based on executable run-time models, and verify the correctness of the adaptation logic in the current system context. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using a temperature control system. With our framework, we enable the design of comprehensible and dependable dynamically evolving adaptation logics.

AB  - However, production and operations management by a definition is a cross-functional discipline. As the business school curriculum is commonly criticized for the lack of business process perspective, the process perspective is even more central in production and operations management. However, actors involved in these processes are numerous and include almost all functional disciplines: purchasing, product development, marketing, administration, accounting and distribution.In this paper we highlight the need to provide education that represents a business process view of organizational functioning. Following three computer supported methodologies are firstly evaluated: (1) traditional simulation, (2) systems dynamics simulation and (3) business gaming. We conclude that the potential in transparent business process simulation games is probably higher for production and operations management rather than for traditional functional business disciplines. This mainly arises from the complexity of the used simulation models; most often management decisions involve simultaneously multiple products and their needed production capacity considerations, among the issues related to successful sales and efficient purchasing Also decision levels are quite blurred, because operative decisions are so tightly connected to tactic and strategy. Sometimes operative issues, such as delivery accuracy might develop to be strategic, because credibility among customer base might decline quite rapidly (with low delivery performance), and future sales potential is therefore falling. For these numerous reasons in this paper we introduce a new business game, named Realgame. This game works within a local area network, where number of different actors can compete with each other in imaginary market environments with their own manufacturing companies. It is also analyzed, what kind of results real time gaming have produced in several Production and Operations Management courses, given for the M.Sc. students.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects, or things, with embedded electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity. The connection of all these things leverages value generation, by offering new services and strategic information. In order to make the Internet of Things possible, the integration of many technologies is necessary, such as machine-to-machine and cyber-physical systems. The process of testing IoT applications introduces new challenges because it does not only includes typical test strategies and methodologies. Testing an IoT system depends on its the specific configuration, and it also needs to consider the hardware platform and the network environment. Currently, industry and academy efforts are focusing on usability and connectivity tests, such as: simulating the environment where the device is to be used, and ensuring information is exchanged in a secure manner. In this paper, we use the current version of our IoT platform to perform stress testing of our IoT platform under different conditions. Our test methodology for IoT applications is also presented. Three different hardware platforms have been used for performing the stress testing of our platform.

AB  - Software-defined vehicles have been the main trend in the automotive industry for the last decades. Digital twins (DT), which are used for the entire design-execute-change-decommissioning lifecycle of real assets and in real-time, are a powerful instrument that could be used both in R&D and engineering education. Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) approach shows its effectiveness in a variety of application domains, one of which is the development of the Electric Vehicle. In this work authors present the modular based digital twin for the powertrain.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 20th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)
CL  - Adelaide, AUSTRALIA
AB  - In Computer science, agent-based modeling (ABM) and multi-agent simulation contribute to scenario anal-ysis, since they may represent patterns of human interaction, which are essential to a better understanding of real systems, including many different aspects such as social, economical and environmental. This paper presents the use of agent-based techniques to define and develop the MASE Multi-Agent System for Envi-ronmental simulation model using two different design approaches: the TROPOS Agent Oriented Software Engineering methodology with JADE framework, and the Agent-Object-Relationship modeling and simulation platform. MASE model system was defined to characterize land-use change dynamics through a replicable pa-rameterization process, useful to the development of agent-based simulation frameworks. However, different agent-based design experiences can enrich the modeling and development process of environmental simulation frameworks, since they embed conceptual structure definition according to specific design concepts. Thus, in this paper we include a short discussion of challenges, perspectives and limitations of two design experiences involving different concepts and techniques for information systems analysis. We believe the reported discus-sion can serve as a starting point to define evaluation criteria for comparative analysis of different agent-based design approaches. To illustrate land-use simulations with MASE we used the Brazilian Cerrado case study.

AB  - Assessing performance of complex systems is important but difficult for all users in every phase of a system lifespan. Current performance analysis tools have proven successful but have not been widely used outside the laboratory. Lab-oriented analyses, queries, and views and rigid, insufficiently documented tool architectures create this situation. This paper presents a framework for addressing these limitations, including multiple abstraction level analysis and an open software architecture to address these limitations. Examination of this framework illustrates its capabilities for varied analysis environments and users.

TI  - Comparison and implementation of machine learning models for predicting the combustion phases of hydrogen-enriched Wankel rotary engines
T2  - FUEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Combustion phases, such as the development period (CA0-10) and flame propagation period (CA10-90), are the critical parameters for hydrogen-enriched Wankel rotary engines. An accurate simulation model and a suitable engine management system are required to control combustion phases. In this paper, five machine learning (ML) models, including the linear regression (LR), regression tree (TR), ensembles of trees (EnTR), support vector machine (SVM), and Gaussian process regression (GPR), are initially applied to predict combustion phases. Experiments were performed with variations of the main fuel types (gasoline and n-butanol), loads (idle and part load), ignition timing, hydrogen volume fraction, and excess air ratio. The sample data were divided into training and testing data set, and the normalization method, 5-fold cross-validation, and Bayesian optimization algorithm were used for data processing and model optimization. Among five ML models, the training speed of the LR model was the fastest; the generalization ability of the TR model was the worst. The minimum leaf size of the TR model significantly influenced regression and generalization ability. On this basis, the EnTR model improved the regression ability, but required more training time. The GPR model showed the best generalization ability among the above model, while SVM performed well in a certain data set. For CA0-10, the coefficient of determination (R2) of the best LR, TR, EnTR, SVM and GPR models was 0.9910, 0.9912, 0.9985, 0.9984 and 0.9994, respectively; for CA10-90, the R2 was 0.9348, 0.8974, 0.9873, 0.9916 and 0.9975, respectively. It is highly recommended to apply the GPR model to the combustion phases prediction and control system modeling.

T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the increased worldwide awareness regarding pollution caused by the consumption of fossil fuels, Battery-powered vehicles are bound to take over the conventional Internal Combustion Engine. Keeping the difficulties faced by the economy of the city and the populace of adapting to an entirely grid-run charging infrastructure in mind, a framework incorporating electric vehicles to everything (EV2X) communication and Charge Slot booking based on data got from a survey conducted has been developed in this literature. The conclusions drawn from the survey develop key insights into developing statisticorating the use of LTE to support the conventional OCPP and promote user controlal models that are further explored in this context. Algorithms and strategies to implement next-generation efficient EV2X communications have been implemented and developed for the city. Further, we have established a priority order for slot booking and incorp over charge-cycles. Introducing IPMUs using an LTE connection to act as a supplement to the conventional OCPP is explored in this context. Besides that, we have built the M/M/m queuing model of EVs in the charging station and its optimisation. We have done the exhaustive evaluation of the robustness of the proposed system in a fairly large-scale network in a discrete-time event simulator. The proposed system's results (simulation, analytical, and comparison) show the reduction of waiting time, good accuracy, and saving of charging time and costs. These performances measures improve shows the real-time applicability of the proposed system.

TI  - Design and Implementation of Simulation-Based Scheduling System with Reinforcement Learning for Re-Entrant Production Lines
T2  - MACHINES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, manufacturing companies have been making efforts to increase resource utilization while ensuring the flexibility of production lines to respond to rapidly changing market environments and customer demand. In the high-tech manufacturing industry, which requires expensive manufacturing facilities and is capital-intensive, re-entrant production lines are used for efficient production with limited resources. In such a production system, a part visits a specific station repeatedly during the production period. However, a re-entrant production line requires an appropriate scheduling system because other parts with different processing requirements are processed at the same station. In this study, a re-entrant production line was modeled as a manufacturing environment via simulation, and an adaptive scheduling system was developed to improve its operational performance by applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL). To achieve this, a software architecture for integrating DRL with the simulation was developed and the states, actions, and rewards of the reinforcement learning (RL) agent were defined. Moreover, a discrete-event simulation control module was designed to collect data from the simulation model and evaluate the policy network trained via DRL. Finally, the applicability and effectiveness of the developed scheduling system were verified by conducting experiments on a hypothetical re-entrant production line.

T2  - MECHANIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an intelligent formation opera-tion mode (IFOM) based on straddle-type rapid transit vehi-cles. Taking the straddle-type rapid transit vehicles operat-ing in IFOM as the object, the operation mode of the vehicle is defined in the control system architecture of the straddle -type rapid transit system. In addition, considering the heter-ogeneous operating environment of formation vehicles, an evaluation index system for formation vehicles is proposed. Then, according to the vehicle longitudinal dynamics model and the artificial potential field formation algorithm, we build the formation vehicle operation controller. After that, referring to the vehicle dynamics model, a multi rigid body dynamics simulation model of formation vehicles in a het-erogeneous operating environment is established. Finally, the operating performance of formation vehicles in hetero-geneous operating environment is analyzed. The analysis re-sults show that the operation performance of the formation vehicle meets the requirements of the evaluation index sys-tem, which proves the feasibility of the formation operation of straddle-type rapid transit vehicles operating in IFOM.

TI  - Integrating reinforcement-learning-based vehicle dispatch algorithm into agent-based modeling of autonomous taxis
T2  - TRANSPORTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - While increasing number of studies are using agent-based models to study the potential environmental, economic, and social impacts of shared autonomous vehicles, the idle vehicle dispatching in these models is often simplified to heuristic rules. Because the system performance of an autonomous taxi fleet can be significantly affected by the vehicle dispatching algorithm, refining the vehicle dispatching can help us better evaluate the potential benefits and impacts of shared autonomous vehicle systems. The recent development of reinforcement-learning-based vehicle dispatching algorithms provides opportunities to improve autonomous vehicle system modeling with efficient and scalable vehicle dispatching. This study integrates a reinforcement learning algorithm into to an agent-based simulation model of a ride hailing system. Using an autonomous taxi fleet in New York City as a case study, we compared the system performance of using the proposed Deep Q-Network (DQN) method for dispatching decision with common rule-based and heuristic dispatch algorithms from relevant literatures. The results show that (1) DQN dispatches vehicles more conservatively (with less dispatching activities and distances) but achieved similar (slightly lower) rider service level with proactive dispatch methods; and (2) DQN outperformed all other dispatch methods evaluated in this study with significantly higher dispatch efficiency, as measured by the ratio of the number of extra riders served due to dispatching to the extra fleet dispatch distance.

AB  - Reliability issues arise in Peer-to-Peer Semantic Knowledge Sharing (P2PSKS) systems. P2PSKS systems are prone to disconnection failures. Disconnection failures deprive the network peers from having access to complete knowledge in the PSPSKS system. Disconnection failures arise when the P2PSKS systems employ the adaptive query routing methods in order to avoid flooding the networks with redundant search messages or queries during information exchange. P2PSKS systems need to utilize fault-tolerant query result evaluation function in order to be reliable. The current publication will focus on two objectives in P2PSKS research: 1. reliability problem identification and 2. reliability problem solutions. The P2PSKS system reliability problem will be identified through the use of simulation modeling techniques. The P2PSKS system reliability problem solutions will be advanced through adaptations of the generous tit-for-tat method which was originally developed in evolutionary game theory. The current research will demonstrate more reliable solutions to address P2PSKS system reliability issues by advancing the Fault-Tolerant Adaptive Query Routing (FTAQR) algorithm.

TI  - Auto-COP: Adaptation generation in Context-oriented Programming using Reinforcement Learning options
T2  - INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Self-adaptive software systems continuously adapt in response to internal and external changes in their execution environment, captured as contexts. The Context-oriented Programming (COP) paradigm posits a technique for the development of self-adaptive systems, capturing their main characteristics with specialized programming language constructs. In COP, adaptations are specified as independent modules that are composed in and out of the base system as contexts are activated and deactivated in response to sensed circumstances from the surrounding environment. However, the definition of adaptations, their contexts and associated specialized behavior, need to be specified at design time. In complex cyber-physical systems this is intractable, if not impossible, due to new unpredicted operating conditions arising.Objective: In this paper, we propose Auto-COP, a new technique to enable generation of adaptations at run time. Auto-COP uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) options to build action sequences, based on the previous instances of the system execution (for example, atomic system actions enacted by human operators). Options are further explored in interaction with the environment, and the most suitable options for each context are used to generate the adaptations, exploiting COP abstractions.Method: To validate Auto-COP, we present two case studies exhibiting different system characteristics and application domains: a driving assistant and a robot delivery system. We present examples of Auto-COP to illustrate the types of circumstances (contexts) requiring adaptation at run time, and the corresponding generated adaptations for each context. Results: We confirm that the generated adaptations exhibit correct system behavior measured by domain specific performance metrics (e.g., conformance to specified speed limit), while reducing the number of required execution/actuation steps by a factor of two showing that the adaptations are regularly selected by the running system as adaptive behavior is more appropriate than the execution of atomic actions.Conclusion: Therefore, we demonstrate that Auto-COP is able to increase system adaptivity by enabling runtime generation of new adaptations for conditions detected at run time, while retaining the modularity offered by COP languages, and reducing the upfront specification required by system developers.

TI  - Application of graph grammars in an educational software engineering game - A case study in pragmatic adoption
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces an approach to modeling software project dynamics using an attributed graph grammar formalism. A project situation is modeled and presented to a "player" who is supposed to act as project manager of a simulated project. Events and internal processes of the simulated project are modeled using a custom-designed formalism that integrates attributed graph grammar concepts with a quantitative simulation mechanism resembling System Dynamics. Both ingredients were pragmatically selected and blended based on (1) their comparative simplicity, (2) their expressive power, and (3) their intuitive appeal for bridging the cognitive gap between real-world software engineering experiences and an executable simulation model.This modeling formalism was applied in the SESAM educational software engineering game. The modeling formalism was supported by a family of graphical SESAM editors. Resulting models could be animated and served as simulated projects in the game runs. SESAM was applied in graduate courses on software project management at the University of Stuttgart. Experiences with the modeling approach are reported. The design history and design rationale that led to using graph grammars as the underlying formalism are described and discussed. The design of the SESAM modeling formalism is presented as an (involuntary) case study in adopting a graph grammar approach.

TI  - Sagging Cable Analysis and Evaluation of 4-degree-of- freedom Cable Robot Using Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING AND ROBOTICS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most important problems in robot modeling and control of cable robots is the problem of inverse kinematics, that is, using the coordinate data of the end effector to calculate the corresponding joint variables. Especially with regard to the kinematics of the cable robot, the sagging of the driven cable can have a significant effect on the calculation of the cable length, and this is more evident when the cable length is large, for example in construction or agriculture applications, where needs a large workspace. The determination of cable deflection considers modeling the cable as a chain model rather than calculating the cable length as a straight-line model. Furthermore, due to the structure and constraints of cable robots or Cable Driven Parallel robots (CDPRs), the system modeling and simulation becomes complicated, thereby increasing the computation time. In this paper, we propose an algorithm of Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) that is used to solve the cable sag problem for the 4 -cable robots. This model was applied to estimate the cable sag for medium-sized cable robots with low travel speed and does not take into account the impact of cable elasticity. A simulation model was conducted and the results showed the advantages of this method in increasing the probability of convergence with small errors. The results of computation and experiment are analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model

TI  - Simulation of system architectures using optimization and machine learning: the state of the art and research opportunities
T2  - SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS MODELING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Most software-intensive systems present large and complex architectures, which should satisfy different quality attributes, such as performance, reliability, and security. Some of these attributes could only be measured at runtime, which is undesired, particularly for critical systems whose attributes should still be evaluated at design time to avoid failures at runtime and losses, including human lives. Simulation has been considered a powerful solution to predict and evaluate different architectural arrangements at design time and, combined with optimization and machine learning, and it can find suitable or even optimal architectures. However, there is a lack of an overview of such combinations and how they can work better. This work presents the state of the art of simulation using optimization and/or machine learning techniques. For this, we examined the literature of 1,342 studies retrieved from three publications databases and systematically selected 87 studies and scrutinized them. There is a variety of combinations of simulation with different optimization and/or machine learning techniques, each requiring specific simulation models and simulators. At the same time, studies are still isolated, lacking maturity in the area and remaining important future work to discover the benefits of such combinations.

AB  - This article describes the impact that autonomous vehicle operation will have on a range of domains and how formal methods can guarantee the safe operation of those vehicles. The verification of the safe operation of autonomous systems (e.g., autopilot systems for commercial aircraft) was traditionally done using precise models and verification software based on formal methods. However, the increasing use of machine-learning-based subsystems (e.g., for perception) requires the use of different verification tools. We describe how formal methods are used today and how they will be adapted for future autonomous vehicles.

TI  - DESC: A hardware-software codesign methodology for distributed embedded systems
T2  - IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The hardware-software codesign of distributed embedded systems is a more challenging task, because each phase of codesign, such as copartitioning, cosynthesis, cosimulation, and coverification must consider the physical restrictions imposed by the distributed characteristics of such systems. Distributed systems often contain several similar parts for which design reuse techniques can be applied. Object-oriented (OO) codesign approach, which allows physical restriction and object design reuse, is adopted in our newly proposed Distributed Embedded System Codesign (DESC) methodology. DESC methodology uses three types of models: Object Modeling Technique (OMT) models for system description and input, Linear Hybrid Automata (LHA) models for internal modeling and verification, and SES/workbench simulation models for performance evaluation. A two-level partitioning algorithm is proposed specifically for distributed systems. Software is synthesized by task scheduling and hardware is synthesized by system-level and object-oriented techniques. Design alternatives for synthesized hardware-software systems are then checked for design feasibility through rapid prototyping using hardware-software emulators. Through a case study on a Vehicle Parking Management System (VPMS), we depict each design phase of the DESC methodology to show benefits of OO codesign and the necessity of a two-level partitioning algorithm.

TI  - Simulation platform for pattern recognition based on reservoir computing with memristor networks
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Memristive systems and devices are potentially available for implementing reservoir computing (RC) systems applied to pattern recognition. However, the computational ability of memristive RC systems depends on intertwined factors such as system architectures and physical properties of memristive elements, which complicates identifying the key factor for system performance. Here we develop a simulation platform for RC with memristor device networks, which enables testing different system designs for performance improvement. Numerical simulations show that the memristor-network-based RC systems can yield high computational performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods in three time series classification tasks. We demonstrate that the excellent and robust computation under device-to-device variability can be achieved by appropriately setting network structures, nonlinearity of memristors, and pre/post-processing, which increases the potential for reliable computation with unreliable component devices. Our results contribute to an establishment of a design guide for memristive reservoirs toward the realization of energy-efficient machine learning hardware.

T2  - COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The modeling of physiological systems via mathematical equations reflects the calculation procedure more than the structure of the real system modeled, with the simulation environment SIMULINK (TM) being one of the best suited to this strategy. Nevertheless, object-oriented modeling is spreading in current simulation environments through the use of the individual components of the model and its interconnections to define the underlying dynamic equations. In this paper we describe the use of the SIMSCAPE (TM) simulation environment in the object-oriented modeling of the closed loop cardiovascular system. The described approach represents a valuable tool in the teaching of physiology for graduate medical students. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The development of complex cyber-physical systems necessitates real-time networking with timing guarantees even in the presence of a link fault. Targeting firm real-time flows with the maximum allowable number of continuous deadline misses, this paper introduces FR-SDN, a fault-resilient SDN (Software-Defined Networking) framework that satisfies the timing requirements of firm real-time flows. To this end, we first investigate individual steps for path restoration: fault recognition, path recalculation, and path reassignment. We then design novel system architecture that reduces the delay of the fault recognition and path reassignment steps to potentially assign more time budget to the path recalculation step. Based on the calculation of tight upper-bounds on the delays in individual steps under the proposed system design, we derive a necessary feasibility condition that guarantees the timing requirements of firm real-time flows, and we calculate a time budget for the path recalculation step. Finally, we develop a multi-constrained path finding algorithm that can dynamically adjust the scope of flows to reroute according to the time budget. To the best of our knowledge, FR-SDN is the first study on adaptive path restoration for real-time flows, taking into account path restoration delay and fault tolerance constraints in case of link fault. We have implemented and evaluated FR-SDN on top of Open vSwitch to demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving an order of magnitude reduction in path restoration delay. In addition, we have deployed FR-SDN into a 1/10 scale autonomous vehicle and have shown, via an in-depth case study of adaptive cruise control, that FR-SDN is able to meet all fault tolerance requirements so that it can behave similarly as if there were no link failure.

TI  - Autonomously Driving Trains on Open Tracks - Concepts, System Architecture and Implementation Aspects
T2  - IT-INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a cyber-physical system that we called autoBAHN as well as some economic and legal aspects for the realization of the vision of a driverless train operating on openly accessible existing railroads, particularly regional branch lines. Existing autonomous trains, e.g., in use on airports, do not need obstacle recognition because they operate on closed tracks that cannot be accessed by humans and have no intersections with roads. The vision is to economically offer a train frequency of about 10 min on regional branch lines. This requires more but smaller trains. As it would not be economically feasible to operate them with human drivers, they need to be autonomous. As it would again not be economically feasible to change the infrastructure (from open to closed tracks), the autonomous trains need to recognize potential obstacles on or near tracks analogous to autonomous cars. First we describe how train intervals of about 10 min can be achieved on single-track railroads. What kind and degree of changes in infrastructural equipment is necessary was validated with the help of a discrete event simulation. The focus of the paper is on the overall system architecture of the prototypical autonomous train that we have implemented and in particular on obstacle recognition. Finally, the current legislation in German speaking countries is surveyed for the assessment of whether an autonomously operating railway system can become reality in the future.

TI  - The Pandemic Holiday Blip in New York City
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - When it comes to pandemics, such as the one caused by the Coronavirus disease COVID-19, various issues and problems have arisen for the healthcare infrastructure and institutions. With increasing number of patients in need of urgent medical care and hospitalizations, the healthcare systems and regional hospitals may approach their maximum service capacity and may face shortage of various parameters, such as supplies including PPE, medications, therapeutic devices, ventilators, beds, and many more. The article at hand describes the development and framework of a simulation model that enables the modeling and evaluation of the COVID-19 pandemic progress. To achieve this, the model dynamically mimics and simulates the developments and time-dependent behavior of various crucial parameters of the pandemic, among others, the daily infection numbers and death rate. In addition, the model enables the simulation of single events and scenarios that occur outside of the regular pandemic developments as anomalies, such as holidays. Unlike traditional models, the proposed framework is based on factors and parameters closely derived from reality, such as the contact rate of individuals, which allows for a much more realistic representation. In addition, the real connection enables the assessment of effects of various influences regarding the development and progress of the pandemic, such as hospitalization numbers over time. All the aforementioned points are possible within the simulation framework and do not require awaiting the unfolding of the effects in reality. Thus, the model is capable of dynamically predicting how different scenarios turn out. The abilities of the model are demonstrated, illustrated, and proven in a specific case study that shows the impact of holidays, such as Passover and Easter in New York City when quarantine measures might have been ignored, and an increase in extended family gatherings temporarily occurred. As a result, the simulation showed significant impacts and disproportionate number of patients in need of medical care that could be potentially detrimental in reality. For example, compared to the previous trajectory of the pandemic, for a temporary increase of 50% in the contact rate of individuals, the model showed that the total number of cases would increase by 461 090, the maximum number of required hospitalizations would rise to 79 733, and the total number of fatalities would climb by 19 125 over 90 days. In addition to its function and proven capabilities, the model can and is furthermore planned to be adapted to other areas, not necessarily only metropolitan regions in order to expand the utilization of its predictive power. Such predictions could be used to derive regulatory measures and to test various policies for COVID-19 containment.

AB  - As the number of smart devices that surround us increases, so do the possibilities of leveraging them to create intelligent, socially-aware systems. However, apart from e-health systems, few applications consider humans as active system players. In fact, most applications/systems have the sole objective of providing some service to humans without considering their intents, actions or emotions. In this respect, they can be looked at as open loop. Systems that do consider human feedback are called Human-in-the-Loop Cyber-Physical-Systems (HiTLCPS), and integrate the humans in a feedback loop, with potential to react and change the environment. In this paper, we propose an approach that implements the HITLCPS concept. The developed platform, ISABELA, explores both online social networks (OSN) data as well as a variety of other data, including environment data and data from personal mobile devices, thus combining IoT, social sensors and mobile sensing. In addition to present the system architecture, the paper provides preliminary results obtained during field trials.

AB  - As part of its research, NASA investigates concepts, aircraft, and operations related to Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). One of the most challenging scenarios for AAM will be enabling safe routine access near densely populated urban centers. AAM flight operations over a regional area require a moderately high-fidelity simulation capability to develop and evaluate autonomy technologies in the urban environment. This paper aims to describe a system to simulate flight operations around regions such as the San Francisco-Oakland Bay area at a moderately-high scale (tens to hundreds of flights) that incorporates detailed vehicle models and control necessary to support research in airborne autonomy. The flight vehicle utilizes NASA AAM concept vehicle dynamics integrated with a custom flight management system and flight control system to simulate all flight phases accurately. The simulation incorporates a detailed simulated urban environment and includes glass cockpit displays to monitor aircraft operations. Simulation models integrate to simulate air and ground-based sensors, such as Radar and LiDAR. As a commercially available rendering engine, X-Plane 11 is used as the renderer to simulate vision-based sensors (such as onboard and ground-based cameras) with a detailed graphical model of a city at different times of the day and weather conditions. This paper presents the simulation and software architecture used for simulating AAM traffic over this urban region. This system enables the evaluation of NASA research concepts in autonomy for urban AAM operations on the path toward flight test evaluation.

AB  - In order to allow Systems Engineers to utilize data produced in cyber-physical systems (CPS), they have to cooperate with data-scientists for custom data-extraction, data-preparation, and/or data-transformation mechanisms. While interfaces in CPS systems might be generic, the data that is produced for custom application needs has to be transformed and merged in very specific ways, to allow systems engineers proper interpretation and insight-extraction. In order to enable efficient cooperation between systems engineers and data scientists, the systems engineers have to provide a fine-grained specification that (a) describes all parts of the CPS, (b) how they might interact, (c) what data is exchanged between them, and (d) how the data inter-relates. A data scientists can then iteratively (including further refinements of the specification) prepare the necessary custom machinelearning models and components. Therefore, this work introduces a method supporting the collaborative definition of machine learning tasks by leveraging model-based systems engineering in the formalization of the systems modeling language SysML. The method supports the identification and integration of various data sources, the required definition of semantic connections between data attributes and the definition of the data processing steps within the machine learning support. Integrating machine learning-specific properties in systems engineering techniques allows non-data scientists to define a machine learning problem, document knowledge on the data, and further supports data scientists to use the formalized knowledge as input for an implementation.

AB  - The amount of data generated worldwide is expected to grow from 33 to 175 ZB by 2025 [1] in part driven by the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems (CPS). To cope with this enormous amount of data, new edge (and cloud) storage techniques must be developed. Generalised Data Deduplication (GDD) is a new paradigm for reducing the cost of storage by systematically identifying near identical data chunks, storing their common component once, and a compact representation of the deviation to the original chunk for each chunk. This paper presents a system architecture for GDD and a proof-of-concept implementation. We evaluated the compression gain of Generalised Data Deduplication using three data sets of varying size and content and compared to the performance of the EXT4 and ZFS file systems, where the latter employs classic deduplication. We show that Generalised Data Deduplication provide up to 16.75% compression gain compared to both EXT4 and ZFS with data sets with less than 5 GB of data.

AB  - Maximizing the production process in modern industry, as proposed by Industry 4.0, requires extensive use of Cyber-Physical Systems (CbPS). Artificial intelligence technologies, through CbPS, allow monitoring of natural processes, making autonomous, decentralized and optimal decisions. Collection of information that optimizes the effectiveness of decisions, implies the need for big data management and analysis. This data is usually coming from heterogeneous sources and it might be non-interoperable. Big data management is further complicated by the need to protect information, to ensure business confidentiality and privacy, according to the recent General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR. This paper introduces an innovative holistic Blockchained Adaptive Federated Auto Meta Learning Big Data and DevOps Cyber Security Architecture in Industry 4.0. The aim is to fill the gap found in the ways of handling and securing industrial data. This architecture, combines the most modern software development technologies under an optimal and efficient framework. It successfully achieves the prediction and assessment of threat-related conditions in an industrial ecosystem, while ensuring privacy and secrecy.

TI  - Population Synthesis Accommodating Heterogeneity: A Bayesian Network and Generalized Raking Technique
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Agent-based microsimulation modeling techniques are adopted for urban system modeling mainly because of their capacity to address the complex interactions among individuals, households, and other urban elements. The performance of urban simulation models is largely dependent on the quality of the input data, which is generated through a population synthesis procedure. This study proposes a Bayesian network and generalized raking techniques for population synthesis. The Bayesian network is used to generate the synthetic population pool from the microsample, and generalized raking is used to fit the synthetic population with the control total. Some of the key features of the proposed population synthesis are as follows: accommodating heterogeneity based on both household and individual attributes; tackling missing/incomplete observations in the microsample; and generating a true synthesis of the population from the microsamples. A data-driven structure learning technique is adopted to generate effective and optimal structures among the heterogenous households and individuals. This Bayesian network + generalized raking procedure is implemented to generate a 100% synthetic population at the smallest zonal level of dissemination area for the Central Okanagan region of British Columbia. The results suggest that capturing heterogeneity within the Bayesian network has tremendously benefitted the reconstruction process to efficiently and accurately generate a synthetic population from the available microsample. Finally, this population synthesis is developed as a component of the agent-based integrated urban model, currently under development at The University of British Columbia's Okanagan campus.

AB  - Self-adaptive systems are evolving systems that can adjust their behaviour to accommodate dynamic requirements or to better serve the goal. These systems can vary in their architecture, operation, or adaptive strategies based on the application. Moreover, the evaluation can happen in different ways depending on system architecture and its requirements. Self-adaptive systems can be prone to situations like adaptation faults, inconsistencies in context or low performance on tasks due to their dynamism and complexity. That is why it is important to have reliability assurance of the system to monitor such situations which can compromise the system functionality. In this paper, we provide a brief background on different types of self-adaptive systems and various ways a system can evolve. We discuss the different mechanisms that have been applied in the last two decades for reliability evaluation of such systems and identify challenges and limitations as research opportunities related to the self-adaptive system's reliability evaluation.

TI  - Towards Automatic Network Slicing for the Internet of Space Things
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of CubeSats as a viable means for realizing satellite networks at low costs has given rise to ubiquitous cyber-physical systems spanning air, ground, and space, in what is being recognized as the Internet of Space Things (IoST). IoST is expected to serve a wide variety of applications ranging from monitoring and reconnaissance to in-space backhauling, i.e., the network architecture must serve a plethora of application scenarios with differing service-level agreement (SLA) requirements over the same physical infrastructure in an end-to-end manner. At the same time, since the different use cases might belong to a variety of different stakeholders, IoST must support multi-tenancy and functional isolation of services. Consequently, a network slicing framework is vital to the success of IoST. To this end, an automatic network slicing framework for space-ground integrated networks is presented in this paper. The proposed framework has been designed to address the dual objectives of route computation and resource allocation with minimal SLA violations. Different from the existing state-of-the-art, the framework presented herein is purpose-built for ultra-dense CubeSat networks, and is fully automated. In other words, the framework is purely SLA-based, and does not require prior information concerning the resource requirements associated with a slice. Other key innovations introduced through this framework include a robust SLA model for slice customization, a novel topology construction mechanism, and a unique segment routing-based online admission control solution. Furthermore, the flexibility and efficacy of the proposed framework have been evaluated through a comprehensive use case driven evaluation scenario.

TI  - Zen-ReqOptimizer: a search-based approach for requirements assignment optimization
T2  - EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - At early phases of a product development lifecycle of large scale Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), a large number of requirements need to be assigned to stakeholders from different organizations or departments of the same organization for review, clarification and checking their conformance to standards and regulations. These requirements have various characteristics such as extents of importance to the organization, complexity, and dependencies between each other, thereby requiring different effort (workload) to review and clarify. While working with our industrial partners in the domain of CPSs, we discovered an optimization problem, where an optimal solution is required for assigning requirements to various stakeholders by maximizing their familiarity to assigned requirements, meanwhile balancing the overall workload of each stakeholder. In this direction, we propose a fitness function that takes into account all the above-mentioned factors to guide a search algorithm to find an optimal solution. As a pilot experiment, we first investigated four commonly applied search algorithms (i.e., GA, (1 + 1) EA, AVM, RS) together with the proposed fitness function and results show that (1 + 1) EA performs significantly better than the other algorithms. Since our optimization problem is multi-objective, we further empirically evaluated the performance of the fitness function with six multi-objective search algorithms (CellDE, MOCell, NSGA-II, PAES, SMPSO, SPEA2) together with (1 + 1) EA (the best in the pilot study) and RS (as the baseline) in terms of finding an optimal solution using an real-world case study and 120 artificial problems of varying complexity. Results show that both for the real-world case study and the artificial problems (1 + 1) EA achieved the best performance for each single objective and NSGA-II achieved the best performance for the overall fitness. NSGA-II has the ability to solve a wide range of problems without having their performance degraded significantly and (1 + 1) EA is not fit for problems with less than 250 requirements Therefore we recommend that, if a project manager is interested in a particular objective then (1 + 1) EA should be used; otherwise, NSGA-II should be applied to obtain optimal solutions when putting the overall fitness as the first priority.

AB  - The ink drop spread(IDS) method has been proposed as a modeling technique for the active learning method. The IDS method, which uses pattern-based processing instead of complex formulas, is able to deal with various modeling targets, ranging from logic operations to complex nonlinear systems. Although the computing structure of the IDS model is characterized by heavy parallel processing on distributed units, its modeling process is simple and efficient and does not require iteration of the same training data set observed in the learning of neural networks. This paper experimentally studies the modeling ability of the IDS method through some typical benchmarks.

TI  - Enabling Hyperparameter Tuning of Machine Learning Classifiers in Production

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 3rd IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Machine Intelligence (IEEE CogMI)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Machine learning (ML) classifiers are widely adopted in the learning-enabled components of intelligent Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) and tools used in designing integrated circuits. Due to the impact of the choice of hyperparameters on an ML classifier performance, hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step for application success. However, the practical adoption of existing hyperparameter tuning frameworks in production is hindered due to several factors such as inflexible architecture, limitations of search algorithms, software dependencies, or closed source nature. To enable state-of-the-art hyperparameter tuning in production, we propose the design of a lightweight library (1) having a flexible architecture facilitating usage on arbitrary systems, and (2) providing parallel optimization algorithms supporting mixed parameters (continuous, integer, and categorical), handling runtime failures, and allowing combined classifier selection and hyperparameter tuning (CASH). We present Mango, a black-box optimization library, to realize the proposed design. Mango is currently used in production at Arm for more than 25 months and is available open-source (https://github.com/ARM-software/mango). Our evaluation shows that Mango outperforms other black-box optimization libraries in tuning hyperparameters of ML classifiers having mixed parameter search spaces. We discuss two use cases of Mango deployed in production at Arm, highlighting its flexible architecture and ease of adoption. The first use case trains ML classifiers on the Dask cluster using Mango to find bugs in Arm's integrated circuits designs. As a second use case, we introduce an AutoML framework deployed on the Kubernetes cluster using Mango. Finally, we present the third use-case of Mango in enabling neural architecture search (NAS) to transfer deep neural networks to TinyML platforms (microcontroller class devices) used by CPS/IoT applications.

AB  - This paper describes the design and implementation of an integrated software package supporting the development, execution, and testing of simulation models dynamically and in real-time, under Windows NT operating system and later. The software has been divided into two parts: the simulator executive and toolkit, and the Instructor Station. The software configuration consists of client/server software, database software, the executive system, input/output interface software, and the Instructor Station. The software architecture allows computers on the network to provide and/or utilize distributed services in a client/server and peer-to-peer environment. Any properly configured machine on the network can utilize the distributed services. Each computer on the network can function as a provider and/or client of services. The distributed network software as a whole provides the run-time environment and off-line utilities required for running and maintaining the simulation. Software components to be installed on a given machine are dependent on the machines intended function: a System Server, Instructor Station, Engineering Workstation, or Simulation computer. This architecture has showed a great,, flexibility to support training simulators with hard and/or soft panels as interface with the operators. In particular this environment has been installed at a full scope training simulator of a nuclear plant with success. It can be used for any kinf of industrial processes simulators.

AB  - A typical HVDC system contains a number of devices that intercommunicate for protection, control, and measurement applications. As the number of devices increases, the network traffic load also increases. Upon reaching the point of saturation of network traffic load, the performance of the system degrades. In this paper, a communication architecture allowing these devices to communicate with each other and human machine interface (HMI) with high network traffic saturation point is introduced. The system is designed to comply with IEC 61850 and is thus divided into three levels: a) the station level, b) the bay control level, and c) the field level. The station level consists of HMI, control devices are placed in the bay control level and field level comprise of the actual measurement and protection devices. With the help of UML, we describe the functionality of the main components and the message exchange process. Using OMNET++, we developed a network simulation model and evaluated the network performance for maximum traffic load. We also discuss the effect of traffic load on the system's performance.

AB  - Assembly simulation technology which is based on virtual reality can benefit a lot to the optimization of product design as well as the training and coaching of workers. At present, the effect of common assembly simulation is not very good, because it only pays attention on the process of assembly and ignores the environment, and it is not interactive just like a movie. In order to change this, we introduce the virtual scene and human computer interaction technology on the basis of Assembly simulation technology, which is through the control of keyboard and mouse to view the details and the assembly simulation in virtual scene from different angle. Also through the control of mouse, we can drag those parts to achieve the assembly, this will surely more conducive to the training and guidance of employees. At Last, an example of assembly simulation for airplane horizontal tail was given, and the result is proved to be effective.

AB  - System modeling and identification is an important tool for analysis, evaluation and prediction in classification, decision analysis and automatic control. Many models have been suggested for noise rejection. The identification of adaptive controllers for practical system is desired for better control and for improved system response even in the presence of the noise. In this paper, a hybrid controller is developed, using Artificial Neural Network and Genetic algorithm, which can provide adaptation. The neuro-controller translates the data (input, output and noise data pertaining to the system) into a control action. A genetic algorithm in integration with neuro-controller is used to determine the weights and biases of the neural network for better response. The performance of these two approaches has been evaluated using data of different plants on a common set of performance indices. The simulations results show that identified GA based Adaptive neuro-controller along with PID controller provides a much better system response under noise condition as compared to using PID controller. The hybrid controller provides a better system response and also helps in maintaining the optimal set point.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 18th Annual IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon)
CL  - Montreal, CANADA
AB  - The 21st century has brought widespread adoption of the cloud computing paradigm when constructing large-scale software systems. While the approach has enabled systems to exhibit software quality attributes such as high agility and scalability, it has also magnified long-standing issues related to maintaining both software development standards and their accompanying software implementations. The research aims to improve or maintain the quality of consumer-driven software as cloud computing adoption becomes more prevalent. Our model-driven approach intends to offer solutions to fix the typical disconnect between design and implementation. The paper demonstrates the construction of a cloud-based healthcare application using a modeling and simulation language called Colored Petri Nets (CPNs). It demonstrates design verification techniques during a model simulation and software prototyping in the context of a cloud-based healthcare application. The healthcare domain serves as an ideal candidate since the domain usually lags behind other industries in updating software development approaches and tools. Furthermore, a cloud-first approach allows for infrastructure that supports millions of patients and physicians distributed globally. The paper aims to promote the technical merits of model-driven design in maintaining high assurance of software quality standards, especially in the context of cloud-based applications. Key contributions of the paper are adoption of model-driven system development in the context of cloud-based applications and integration of machine-learning models into simulation models for such purposes.

AB  - Avionics systems play a significant role in civil aircraft, and its reliability is directly related to the flight safe. In this paper, integrated modular avionics (IMA), as the most advanced avionics systems, is analyzed. Via exploration of the interaction mechanism of IMA and real physical system, its property of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is determined. Hence, according to different functional modules, a cyber-physical avionics systems model is established for IMA, meanwhile task-oriented state spaces of sub-units in CPS architecture are assigned to construct the hierarchical model for reliability model of IMA. A mathematic formula is presented to calculate reliability. The key contribution is that task-oriented cyber-physical idea is applied, and a hierarchical model for reliability analysis of IMA is presented. At last, reliability model is applied to a case study, which shows that two different way to raise IMA reliability.

AB  - In this paper, we have designed a multi layer neural network (MLNN) to estimate an unknown model of a non-linear signal generator in both cases of noise-free and noisy environments. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) has taken different values and simulation program has been executed for each case of SNR. We have obtained almost the accurate models for the noise-free examples. And robustness of the neural network model against noise has been examined through different values of SNR. We have obtained nearly good models using considerably large noise power. The model parameters such as the model size and the learning rate of the learning algorithm have been minimized in each case. Superiority of neural network models have been demonstrated by comparing the model performance in each case with that of the linear finite-impulse-response filter (FIR) model for that case.

TI  - Model-Based Cybersecurity Analysis Extending Enterprise Modeling to Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity
T2  - BUSINESS & INFORMATION SYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Critical infrastructure (CIs) such as power grids link a plethora of physical components from many different vendors to the software systems that control them. These systems are constantly threatened by sophisticated cyber attacks. The need to improve the cybersecurity of such CIs, through holistic system modeling and vulnerability analysis, cannot be overstated. This is challenging since a CI incorporates complex data from multiple interconnected physical and computation systems. Meanwhile, exploiting vulnerabilities in different information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) systems leads to various cascading effects due to interconnections between systems. The paper investigates the use of a comprehensive taxonomy to model such interconnections and the implied dependencies within complex CIs, bridging the knowledge gap between IT security and OT security. The complexity of CI dependence analysis is harnessed by partitioning complicated dependencies into cyber and cyber-physical functional dependencies. These defined functional dependencies further support cascade modeling for vulnerability severity assessment and identification of critical components in a complex system. On top of the proposed taxonomy, the paper further suggests power-grid reference models that enhance the reproducibility and applicability of the proposed method. The methodology followed was design science research (DSR) to support the designing and validation of the proposed artifacts. More specifically, the structural, functional adequacy, compatibility, and coverage characteristics of the proposed artifacts are evaluated through a three-fold validation (two case studies and expert interviews). The first study uses two instantiated power-grid models extracted from existing architectures and frameworks like the IEC 62351 series. The second study involves a real-world municipal power grid.

TI  - Automated engineering of domain-specific metamorphic testing environments
T2  - INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Testing is essential to improve the correctness of software systems. Metamorphic testing (MT) is an approach especially suited when the system under test lacks oracles, or they are expensive to compute. However, building an MT environment for a particular domain (e.g., cloud simulation, model transformation, machine learning) requires substantial effort.Objective: Our goal is to facilitate the construction of MT environments for specific domains.Method: We propose a model-driven engineering approach to automate the construction of MT environments. Starting from a meta-model capturing the domain concepts, and a description of the domain execution environment, our approach produces an MT environment featuring comprehensive support for the MT process. This includes the definition of domain-specific metamorphic relations, their evaluation, detailed reporting of the testing results, and the automated search-based generation of follow-up test cases. Results: Our method is supported by an extensible platform for Eclipse, called Gotten. We demonstrate its effectiveness by creating an MT environment for simulation-based testing of data centres and comparing with existing tools; its suitability to conduct MT processes by replicating previous experiments; and its generality by building another MT environment for video streaming APIs.Conclusion: Gotten is the first platform targeted at reducing the development effort of domain-specific MT environments. The environments created with Gotten facilitate the specification of metamorphic relations, their evaluation, and the generation of new test cases.

AB  - Modern cyber-physical systems often require security, heterogeneity, and real-time operation from their hardware platform and operating system. However, highly predictable real-time operating systems such as FreeRTOS do not employ strong component isolation required for platform security. Microkernels implement such isolation using virtual memory and code running in the privileged CPU mode, complicating real-time analysis.In this work, we start with a different architectural approach: M-3 is an existing hardware/software co-design for heterogeneous systems that features strong isolation between cores. However, the real-time properties of this platform have not been investigated. We first survey M-3's current state for real-time applicability and study both the communication latencies in comparison to other systems and M-3's different approach to task priorities. Furthermore we improve M-3's real-time applicability by adding a network-on-chip traffic regulation and enabling the enforcement of resource limits. With these additions, M-3 enables local reasoning about application execution. We perform the evaluation with an FPGA-based hardware prototype and in simulation based on gem5.

TI  - Evaluation of the Level of Reliability in Hazardous Technological Processes
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In an automated systems environment is very important to predicted failures or unexpected situations to achieve system reliability. Failure of such systems can cause serious property damage, the environment, damage to human health or cause death. The essential task is to determine the tolerable and acceptable risk. The required level of risk for safety-critical systems can be achieved by using international technical standards and applying safety functions. Safety functions are implemented using an electrical/electronic/programmable electronics (E/E/PE) safety-related system. Technical standards offer the aspect of balancing risk tolerability according to the relevant, reliable safety functions. Based on the specific architecture of the whole system, it is possible to determine the maximum failure rate of the probability of failure on demand (PFDSYS) of the selected architecture. Subsequent application of reliability analysis using the event tree analysis (ETA) and fault tree analysis (FTA) methods can optimize the failure rate of the entire system. Application of reliability analysis using event tree analysis (ETA) and fault tree analysis (FTA) methods can only theoretically optimize the failure rate of the entire system with constant initial conditions and constant parameters of the reliability functions. The article proposes a new methodology for dynamic analysis of the state of system reliability as a function of the system operation time, maintenance frequency and system architecture. As a result of the methodology is a library of standard element architectures and simulation models which allows predicting and optimizing the reliability of E/E/PE safety-related systems.

AB  - In this paper the problem of non-stationary and non-linear system modeling is addressed, and an original solution based on time-variant neural networks proposed. The time-variance property is due to the decomposition of the weight parameters into a linear combination of proper time functions, namely basis functions, as already investigated by Grenier for linear models. The neural architecture here addressed is a IIR-buffered MLP, trained through teacher-forced based backpropagation. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the idea, since modeling performances achieved by using these networks are superior than those relative to classic (time-invariant)MLP schemes.

TI  - EWnFM: An Environment States Oriented Web Service Non-Functional Property Model
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - A proper model of Web service non-functional properties is the key foundation to the evaluation of non-functional properties of Adaptive Service Based Software (ASBS) systems. As the environment in which a Web service is deployed may keep changing, environmental factors would affect the non-functional properties of a Web service a lot. However, available non-functional property models usually ignore the impact of environmental factors, leading to insufficient modeling power of non-functional properties, limited effect of system wide non-functional property evaluation based on these models, and the inability to support environment states oriented specifications of ASBS. This paper propose an environment states oriented Web service non-functional property model. By considering the differences of a non-functional property under different environment states, environment states of a Web service is analyzed using a Dirichlet process based method. With such a foundation, an environment states oriented Web service non-functional property model is introduced, together with the parameter estimation methods based on historical monitor data. Experiment results have shown that compared to the evaluated methods, our model could generate data that are much close to real monitored data.

TI  - Leveraging Traceability to Integrate Safety Analysis Artifacts into the Software Development Process

AB  - Safety-critical system's failure or malfunction can cause loss of human lives or damage to the physical environment; therefore, continuous safety assessment is crucial for such systems. In many domains this includes the use of Safety assurance cases (SACs) as a structured argument that the system is safe for use. SACs can be challenging to maintain during system evolution due to the disconnect between the safely analysis and system development process. Further, safety analysts often lack domain knowledge and tool support to evaluate the SAC. We propose a solution that leverages software traceability to connect relevant system artifacts to safety analysis models, and then uses these connections to visualize the change. We elicit design rationales for system changes to help safely stakeholders analyze the impact of system changes on safety. We present new traceability techniques for closer integration of the safety analysis and system development process, and illustrate the viability of our approach using examples from a cyber-physical system that deploys Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for emergency response.

AB  - Computer Vision (CV) is used in a broad range of Cyber-Physical Systems such as surgical and factory floor robots and autonomous vehicles including small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS). It enables machines to perceive the world by detecting and classifying objects of interest, reconstructing 3D scenes, estimating motion, and maneuvering around objects. CV algorithms are developed using diverse machine learning and deep learning frameworks, which are often deployed on limited resource edge devices. As sUAS rely upon an accurate and timely perception of their environment to perform critical tasks, problems related to CV can create hazardous conditions leading to crashes or mission failure. In this paper, we perform a systematic literature review (SLR) of CV-related challenges associated with CV, hardware, and software engineering. We then group the reported challenges into five categories and fourteen sub-challenges and present existing solutions. As current literature focuses primarily on CV and hardware challenges, we close by discussing implications for Software Engineering, drawing examples from a CV-enhanced multi-sUAS system.

AB  - The objective of this paper was to model a non-linear system, which could ordinarily be modelled using a large complicated neural network, using a combination of smaller more simple neural networks without loosing too much information.This objective was achieved through the research and use of several mathematical techniques including boosting and back-propagation to develop an algorithm which could extract the linear features of the non-linear system. Implementation of this algorithm was then done using Matlab as a modelling tool, this includes useful tools for dealing with neural networks.The results shown suggest that this technique can indeed model a complicated system by "breaking" it into smaller simpler sections.

TI  - A distributed industrial battery management network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses a control network organization for industrial battery management. The battery network is logically partitioned into strings containing groups of cells. These groups of cells are managed locally by distributed control nodes that communicate through the local controller area network (CAN). Battery information is communicated to the remote user through TCP/IP. Both CAN and TCP/IP are connected through the gateway database, allowing for transitions from the battery process time and data volume domain into that of the remote user. The system architecture is based on multiple concurrent processes that facilitate necessary battery monitoring and charge management as well as availability of timely interaction with remote users. Autonomy of these processes is encouraged through the distributed data storage organization. Modeling and testing of the proposed architecture reflects the potential capacity for managing battery requirements and network traffic. Scalability of the approach to suit battery network size may also prove useful to serve other similar applications.

AB  - The Agile Software Development methodologies has enjoyed a widespread acceptance in the software development industry. While iterative and incremental approach of agile methodologies are the main attractions, at the same time they make estimation and predictability of agile software projects a challenge. Delivering workable software in short cycles helps with collecting more heuristic data as compared to traditional waterfall methodologies. Such data can be used as quantitative metrics for time and effort estimation that in turn can help with risk mitigation and risk avoidance. Although traditional agile formulations and recommendations place emphasis on individuals and interactions over processes and tools, this paper considers processes and tools essential in agile processes of today's complex software systems and distributed teams. Emphasis on processes and tools enables agile software projects to produce project metrics that can be effectively used in predictive analytics and risk management. The system that is introduced here emphasizes on quantitative approach to agile project planning and introduces a risk management model that produces risk metrics that are used to help with risk avoidance and risk mitigation. The risk metrics and the project simulation model are used to adjust project factors such as time, cost and scope during lifespan of project. Such adjustments come from recommender system that proposes changes to a wide range of project parameters for risk mitigation and risk avoidance.

AB  - Due to the ever-increasing complexity of embedded system design and the need for rapid system evaluations in early design stages, the use of simulation models known as Virtual Platforms (VPs) has been of utmost importance as they enable system modeling at higher abstraction levels. Since a typical VP features multiple interdependent components, VP libraries have been utilized in order to provide off-the-shelf models of commonly-used hardware components, such as CPUs. However, CPU power estimation is not adequately supported by existing VP libraries. In addition, existing power characterization techniques require architectural details which are not always available in early design stages. To address this issue, this paper proposes a technique for power annotation of CPU models targeting SystemC/TLM libraries in order to enable the accurate power estimation at higher abstraction levels. By using a set of benchmarks on a power-annotated SystemC/TLM model of Xilinx Microblaze soft-processor, it is shown that the proposed approach can achieve accurate power estimation in comparison to the real-system power measurements as the estimation error ranges from 0.47% up to 6.11% with an average of 2%.

AB  - The High Level Architecture (HLA) for distributed simulation was proposed by the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office of the Department of Defense (DOD) in order to support interoperability among simulations as well as reuse of simulation models. One aspect of reusability is to collect and analyze data generated in simulation exercises, including a record of events that occur during the execution, and the states of simulation objects. In order to improve the performance of existing data collection mechanisms in the HLA simulation system, the paper proposes a multi-agent data collection system. The proposed approach adopts the hierarchical data management/organization mechanism to achieve fast data access which is indispensable to the analysis of simulation exercise. Furthermore, the multi-agent data collection system adopts a formalization expression method to describe the system behavioral characteristics, and implements the hierarchy language supports to the description by combing the XML and Petri net. In addition, we propose an independent reinforcement learning algorithm to generate optimized joint recording program which guarantees that the data collection and query tasks can be rationally distributed among logging agents as well as efficiently utilize computational resource. The testing results indicate that the proposed approach, tinder the premise of complete collection of simulation data, not only reduces the network load imposed by data collection components, but also provides effective supports to the analysis of simulation exercise.

TI  - Using collaborative computing technologies to enable the sharing and integration of simulation services for product design
T2  - SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays simulation is commonly used in engineering design for verifying design concepts before physical prototypes are produced. The simulation of complex products such as mechatronics in general involves a synergy of multiple traditional disciplinary areas and entails the collaborative work of a multidisciplinary team. A need thus arises for supporting the effective and efficient integration of subsystem models at simulation runtime and in a distributed environment. These models are generally created using different simulation tools and depend on the inputs from each other to perform numerical integration. As such, many issues need to be addressed, e.g. system modeling, the use of computing technologies, and the runtime interaction between models. In this paper, a service-oriented paradigm is presented which is underpinned by collaborative computing technologies to enable the provision of simulation models as services as well as the integration of these services for performing simulation tasks in product design. As well as the implementation of such a paradigm, a method for the interaction between models is in particular developed to achieve high accuracy for the simulation of design problems involving the solving of system equations. Preliminary evaluation work shows that the proposed paradigm underpinned by collaborative computing technologies is viable and have great potential in supporting collaborative simulation development in industry and the method for interaction control successfully achieves better accuracy compared with traditional methods.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th International Conference on Computers in Agriculture
CL  - CANCUN, MEXICO
AB  - A computer simulation model used to help in the planning process of irrigation districts operation is presented. A yearly irrigation planning process, is divided into three main steps: the formulation of a benefit function of a given or optimally obtained, cropping pattern to be planted in the irrigation district; the computation of quantities of resources required for the cropping pattern; and the mass balance of the reservoir(s) to define if the cropping pattern water requirements will be satisfied with the monthly stored, expected inflows to reservoirs and groundwater volumes of water. The model takes into account the physical and economical constraints of the system to be modeled. Those steps are solved using either an expert computer package, named IRPSYS or SISPIR (in Spanish) or with a spreadsheet. IRPSYS is programed in three modules. The first one, manages the files required in the planning process. The second one, helps to perform the statistical analysis of meteorological and hydrological monthly data. The third one, computes the requirements of water, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, machine-hours and labor needed for the proposed cropping pattern as well as the monthly reservoir performance considering, and if required, the calculation of hydropower generation with water released for irrigation. The planning model, has been programed in a spreadsheet which performs the same calculations that SISPIR does. Both computer packages permit the study of alternative cropping patterns in the irrigation district and yield the monthly schedule of reservoir storages and releases and aquifer withdrawals as well as the annual profit in the district. The software has been studied and adapted to several irrigation districts in Mexico. They have proven to be useful both in the real world planning process as well as training tools for students and engineers that work in the Mexican irrigation districts.

AB  - Reinforcement learning (RL) is being used to create self-adaptive agents, where RL researchers commonly create and employ simulations of the problem domains to train and evaluate various RL algorithms and their variants. This activity is in need of methodological and tool-based support, particularly concerning the reuse of model-and simulation-related code across various RL experiments. We propose a workflow and tool for the decoupled development and maintenance of multi-purpose agent-based models and derived single-purpose RL environments, enabling the researcher to swap out environments with ones representing different perspectives or different reward models, all while keeping the underlying domain model intact and separate.

T2  - COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) and the related terms, Smart Manufacturing, Cyber-Physical Systems, and Industry 4.0, attract significant interest in the chemical manufacturing industry. Such technologies, which include in-Cloud data storage, large scale computation, advanced control, enterprise-wide-optimization, and machine-learning, offer opportunities for improved production management, rapid proto-typing, and lower cost. This paper describes the application and proof of concept (POC) of the Vitro base-architecture for Smart Manufacture. Benchmarking against current technology showed that the engineering time required for data reconciliation, rectification, and standardization is significantly reduced. Instead of spending 80% of their efforts on such activities, process engineers and data scientists started to spend most of their time on real-time process analysis and decision making. The cloud-based architecture used to support the development was developed under a cooperative project between Vitro and Microsoft. The architecture can be applied to other industry sectors, such as the chemicals, petro-chemicals, pharmaceutical, agricultural, and metallurgical industries. The current paper describes the data management component of the project. It describes the standardized storage formats used for uniform display of rectified process data in engineering units. We found that the MS Azure based system provides operators, process engineers, and managers alike, the data needed to run the process at or close to optimal conditions minute by minute, day by day, and week by week as product portfolios and markets change. In a follow-up paper we will describe how the approach facilitates application of APC such adaptive MPC, real time optimization, and adaptive decision-making. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Model driven engineering for machine learning components: A systematic literature review
T2  - INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Context: Machine Learning (ML) has become widely adopted as a component in many modern software applications. Due to the large volumes of data available, organizations want to increasingly leverage their data to extract meaningful insights and enhance business profitability. ML components enable predictive capabilities, anomaly detection, recommendation, accurate image and text processing, and informed decisionmaking. However, developing systems with ML components is not trivial; it requires time, effort, knowledge, and expertise in ML, data processing, and software engineering. There have been several studies on the use of model-driven engineering (MDE) techniques to address these challenges when developing traditional software and cyber-physical systems. Recently, there has been a growing interest in applying MDE for systems with ML components. Objective: The goal of this study is to further explore the promising intersection of MDE with ML (MDE4ML) through a systematic literature review (SLR). Through this SLR, we wanted to analyze existing studies, including their motivations, MDE solutions, evaluation techniques, key benefits and limitations. Method: Our SLR is conducted following the well-established guidelines by Kitchenham. We started by devising a protocol and systematically searching seven databases, which resulted in 3934 papers. After iterative filtering, we selected 46 highly relevant primary studies for data extraction, synthesis, and reporting. Results: We analyzed selected studies with respect to several areas of interest and identified the following: (1) the key motivations behind using MDE4ML; (2) a variety of MDE solutions applied, such as modeling languages, model transformations, tool support, targeted ML aspects, contributions and more; (3) the evaluation techniques and metrics used; and (4) the limitations and directions for future work. We also discuss the gaps in existing literature and provide recommendations for future research. Conclusion: This SLR highlights current trends, gaps and future research directions in the field of MDE4ML, benefiting both researchers and practitioners.

AB  - Each software modeling tool typically supports only a few tasks among model creation, simulation, debugging, analysis, transformation, deployment, and monitoring. Therefore, multiple tools must generally be jointly used. However, few guarantees are generally provided regarding their semantic compatibility. This paper presents AnimUML, a UML modeling tool supporting most modeling tasks, and helping users from early model creation to deployment. Semantic compatibility between tasks is ensured by leveraging a single semantics implementation. AnimUML is successfully used as a framework on which to build research activities. It is also used to teach embedded UML modeling, as well as UML model verification.

AB  - Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) security has gained a lot of interest in recent years. Different approaches have been proposed to tackle the security challenges. Intrusion detection has been of most interest so far, involving design-based and data-based approaches. Design-based approaches require domain expertise and are not scalable, on the other hand, data-based approaches suffer from the lack of real-world datasets available for specific critical physical processes. In this work, a data collection effort is made on a realistic Water Distribution (WADI) test-bed. Collected data consists of both the normal operation as well as a range of attack scenarios. Next, machine learning-based system-modeling techniques are considered using the data from WADI. It is shown that the accuracy of system model-based intrusion detectors depends on the model accuracy and for nonlinear processes, it is non-trivial to obtain accurate system models. Moreover, an operational invariants-based attack detection technique is proposed using the system design parameters. It is shown that using a simple rule-based anomaly detector performs better than the complex black-box data-based techniques.

TI  - Navigating the Evolution of Digital Twins Research through Keyword Co-Occurence Network Analysis
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Digital twin technology has become increasingly popular and has revolutionized data integration and system modeling across various industries, such as manufacturing, energy, and healthcare. This study aims to explore the evolving research landscape of digital twins using Keyword Co-occurrence Network (KCN) analysis. We analyze metadata from 9639 peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2023. The results unfold in two parts. The first part examines trends and keyword interconnection over time, and the second part maps sensing technology keywords to six application areas. This study reveals that research on digital twins is rapidly diversifying, with focused themes such as predictive and decision-making functions. Additionally, there is an emphasis on real-time data and point cloud technologies. The advent of federated learning and edge computing also highlights a shift toward distributed computation, prioritizing data privacy. This study confirms that digital twins have evolved into complex systems that can conduct predictive operations through advanced sensing technologies. The discussion also identifies challenges in sensor selection and empirical knowledge integration.

AB  - The digital system modeling plays an important role to plan, design, cost-effective layouts, and market-driven implementation of the physical devices such as electric vehicles, 3D-home, and aircrafts. Based on the client demands, requirements, and specifications, manufacturing company is sending physical items or layouts or STL files to destinations which can be local and international places. Unfortunately, it is a challenging, expensive, risky, and time consuming task. Interesting, the internet of things (IoT) can play an important role to transfer design layout to the qualified and intended destination for verification and fabrication. Regrettably, attacker can hack, modify, steal, and destroy layout and prototype over networks. Due to industrial revolution, the additive manufacturing industry is the second most vulnerable sector after financial institution where cyber attack can play significant impact. This paper summarises the cyber physical additive manufacturing systems security and privacy issues and provide a secure IoT communication architecture. In order to improve the security and privacy, we proposed an innovative IoT communication network where information is securely transferred to the destination.

T2  - OPTICAL MICROLITHOGRAPHY XX, PTS 1-3
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Optical Microlithography XX
CL  - San Jose, CA
AB  - This paper introduces Dr.LiTHO, a research and development oriented lithography simulation environment developed at Fraunhofer IISB to flexibly integrate our simulation models into one coherent platform. We propose a light-weight approach to a lithography simulation environment: The use of a scripting (batch) language as an integration platform. Out of the great variety of different scripting languages, Python proved superior in many ways: It exhibits a good-natured learning-curve, it is efficient, available on virtually any platform, and provides sophisticated integration mechanisms for existing programs. In this paper, we will describe the steps, required to provide Python bindings for existing programs and to finally generate an integrated simulation environment. In addition, we will give a short introduction into selected software design demands associated with the development of such a framework. We will especially focus on testing and (both technical and user-oriented) documentation issues.Dr.LiTHO Python files contain not only A simulation parameter settings but also the simulation flow, providing maximum flexibility. In addition to relatively simple batch jobs, repetitive tasks can be pooled in libraries. And as Python is a full-blown programming language, users can add virtually any functionality, which is especially useful in the scope of simulation studies or optimization tasks, that often require masses of evaluations. Furthermore, we will give a short overview of the numerous existing Python packages. Several examples demonstrate the feasibility and productiveness of integrating Python packages into custom Dr.LiTHO scripts.

TI  - Approaching parallel computing to simulating population dynamics in demography
T2  - PARALLEL COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agent-based modelling and simulation is a promising methodology that can be applied in the study of population dynamics. The main advantage of this technique is that it allows representing the particularities of the individuals that are modeled along with the interactions that take place among them and their environment. Hence, classical numerical simulation approaches are less adequate for reproducing complex dynamics. Nowadays, there is a rise of interest on using distributed computing to perform large-scale simulation of social systems. However, the inherent complexity of this type of applications is challenging and requires the study of possible solutions from the parallel computing perspective (e.g., how to deal with fine grain or irregular workload). In this paper, we discuss the particularities of simulating populating dynamics by using parallel discrete event simulation methodologies. To illustrate our approach, we present a possible solution to make transparent the use of parallel simulation for modeling demographic systems: Yades tool. In Yades, modelers can easily define models that describe different demographic processes with a web user interface and transparently run them on any computer architecture environment thanks to its demographic simulation library and code generator. Therefore, transparency is provided by two means: the provision of a web user interface where modelers and policy makers can specify their agent-based models with the tools they are familiar with, and the automatic generation of the simulation code that can be executed in any platform (cluster or supercomputer). A study is conducted to evaluate the performance of our solution in a High Performance Computing environment. The main benefit of this outline is that our findings can be generalized to problems with similar characteristics to our demographic simulation model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Machine learning-based test selection for simulation-based testing of self-driving cars software
T2  - EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulation platforms facilitate the development of emerging Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) like self-driving cars (SDC) because they are more efficient and less dangerous than field operational test cases. Despite this, thoroughly testing SDCs in simulated environments remains challenging because SDCs must be tested in a sheer amount of long-running test cases. Past results on software testing optimization have shown that not all the test cases contribute equally to establishing confidence in test subjects' quality and reliability, and the execution of "safe and uninformative" test cases can be skipped to reduce testing effort. However, this problem is only partially addressed in the context of SDC simulation platforms. In this paper, we investigate test selection strategies to increase the cost-effectiveness of simulation-based testing in the context of SDCs. We propose an approach called SDC-Scissor (SDC coS t-effeC tI ve teS t S electOR) that leverages Machine Learning (ML) strategies to identify and skip test cases that are unlikely to detect faults in SDCs before executing them. Our evaluation shows that SDC-Scissor outperforms the baselines. With the Logistic model, we achieve an accuracy of 70%, a precision of 65%, and a recall of 80% in selecting tests leading to a fault and improved testing cost-effectiveness. Specifically, SDC-Scissor avoided the execution of 50% of unnecessary tests as well as outperformed two baseline strategies. Complementary to existing work, we also integrated SDC-Scissor into the context of an industrial organization in the automotive domain to demonstrate how it can be used in industrial settings.

TI  - Performance analysis and enhancement of brain emotion-based intelligent controller and its impact on PMBLDC motor drive for electric vehicle applications
T2  - ENERGY SOURCES PART A-RECOVERY UTILIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing awareness of electric vehicles insists on the necessity of Permanent Magnet Brushless Direct Current Motor (PMBLDCM) worldwide. This paper involves building a simulation model of the complete PMBLDCM drive system using Matlab/Simulink to control the speed and Torque. Using the Simulink model, speed parameters with various controllers of the drive system are studied and analyzed. The conventional PI controller is capable of controlling the speed of the PMBLDC motor. H1owever, it cannot give assurance of the stability of the motor throughout the load variation. In a speed loop, Improved Brain Emotional Learning Based Intelligent Controller (IBELBIC) is proposed in this paper. The proposed IBELBIC-based PMBLDC motor drive system with a rating of 3 phase, 30 V, 400 W, 3000 RPM is implemented using Spartan 3 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) from Xilinx. This paper presents an IBELBIC design for enhancing the speed performance of the drive system at various set speeds and different load conditions of 1.2 Nm load, 0.6 Nm load, and no load. The proposed PMBLDCM drive system is realized with the help of a Very high speed integrated circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) programming algorithm of digital Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) generator topology. Various test cases are evaluated under different operating conditions to demonstrate the learning capability and the applicability of the proposed controller. In this paper, simulation validation is done using hardware setup, and experimental results are monitored on a computer using a customized program developed using LabVIEW (Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation Engineering Workbench). Instead of a Data Acquisition (DAQ) card, the Virtual Instrument Software Architecture (VISA) tool of LabVIEW software is used in this work and results in cost minimization of the experimental setup.

AB  - Advances in Machine Learning (ML) have brought previously hard to handle problems within arm's reach. However, this power comes at the cost of unassured reliability and lacking transparency. Overcoming this drawback is very hard due to the probabilistic nature of ML. Current approaches mainly tackle this problem by developing more robust learning procedures. Such algorithmic approaches, however, are limited to certain types of uncertainties and cannot deal with all of them, e.g., hardware failure. This paper discusses how this problem can be addressed at architectural rather than algorithmic level to assess systems dependability properties in early development stages. Moreover, we argue that Self-Adaptive Systems (SAS) are more suited to safeguard ML w.r.t. various uncertainties. As a step towards this we propose classes of dependability in which ML-based systems may be categorized and discuss which and how assurances can be made for each class.

TI  - CPS: Small: Integrated Reconfigurable Control and Moving Target Defense for Secure Cyber-Physical Systems
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are engineered systems created as networks of interacting physical and computational processes. Most modern products in major industrial sectors, such as automotive, avionics, medical devices, and power systems already are or rapidly becoming CPS driven by new requirements and competitive pressures. However, in recent years, a number of successful cyber attacks against CPS targets, some of which have even caused severe physical damage, have demonstrated that security and resilience of CPS is a very critical problem, and that new methods and technologies are required to build dependable systems. Modern automotive vehicles, for example, employ sensors such as laser range finders and cameras, GPS and inertial measurement units, on-board computing, and network connections all of which contribute to vulnerabilities that can be exploited for deploying attacks with possibly catastrophic consequences. Securing such systems requires that potential points of compromise and vehicle-related data are protected. In order to fulfill the great promise of CPS technologies such as autonomous vehicles and realize the potential technological, economic, and societal impact, it is necessary to develop principles and methods that ensure the development of CPS capable of functioning dependably, safely, and securely. In view of these challenges, the project develops an approach for integration of reconfigurable control software design and moving target defense for CPS. The main idea is to improve CPS security by making the attack surface dynamic and unpredictable while ensuring safe behavior and correct functionality of the overall system. The proposed energy-based control design approach generates multiple alternatives of the software application that are robust to performance variability and uncertainty.  A runtime environment is designed to implement instruction set randomization, address space randomization, and data space randomization. The heart of the runtime environment is a configuration manager that can modify the software configuration, either proactively or reactively upon detection of attacks, while preserving the functionality and ensuring stable and safe CPS behavior. By changing the control software on-the-fly, the approach creates a cyber moving target and raises significantly the cost for a successful attack without impacting the essential behavior and functionality. Demonstration and experimental evaluation will be performed using a hardware-in-the-loop simulation testbed for automotive CPS.

AB  - In recent years, the cyber and physical extreme events have increased and impacted the power system operations. Although there are multiple work reported for improving the resiliency of the power grid systems, there are a limited number of resiliency management tools available to the grid operators. Addressing the data quality issue is critical before feeding the measurements for situational awareness and decision-making using resiliency management tools. In this work, we describe an automated ML-based measurement data anomaly mitigation technique that uses regression, clustering, deep learning techniques as a base detector. Maximum Likelihood Criterion (MLE) based ensemble of these base detectors helps in anomaly detection and mitigation using SyncAED tool and feeding data for enhanced resiliency using a tool: Cyber-Physical Transmission Resiliency Assessment Metric (CP-TRAM). CP-TRAM utilizes real-time power grid data and aims to assist operators in measuring resiliency and ensuring the energy supply to critical loads given a cyber-attack or a natural disaster. This paper discusses the multiple ML algorithms for data anomaly detection, the basis of software design considerations, open-source software components, and use cases for the prototype developed tools.

AB  - The high dependence on software in today's society has increased the demand of reliable software immediately. Many researchers have proposed various software reliability growth models (SRGMs) to forecast software reliability by analyzing failure data throughout the testing process. Unfortunately, since software is an intellectual artifact obeying cognitive informatics, its failures involve lots of epistemic uncertainty that can not be handled well by existing methods. Furthermore, different software errors have different implications and thus need different handling. In order to deal with these problems, this paper deduce a novel multiple error types software belief reliability growth model (MESBRGM) under the framework of uncertainty theory. Reliability evaluation is conducted by investigating several reliability indexes namely belief reliability and belief reliable time based on belief reliability theory. Parameter estimations for unknown parameters in MESBRGM are also derived. Real data analysis illustrates our proposed model in detail, and demonstrate its capability compared with several popular models.

AB  - Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is characterized by a decentralized intelligence using service-based information technology. With the existing technologies in industrial solutions, the implementation of partly automated collaborative work of decentralized devices is difficult to achieve. Current industrial solutions fulfill manufacturer specific requirements that are not transferable to other industrial challenges. These customized solutions do not allow a plug-and-produce approach or a dynamically scalable system network. This work presents an approach for this through the use of a proposed service-based Industry 4.0 middleware. An example of its use is introduced in the form of the collaborative work of cranes, which handle the mentioned challenges. The proposed middleware is based on the service-oriented architecture with an evaluation of the I4.0 middleware using a demonstrator of collaborative work between cranes.

TI  - Nonlinear system modeling and application based on restricted Boltzmann machine and improved BP neural network
T2  - APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at the complexity, nonlinearity and difficulty in modeling of nonlinear system. In this paper, an improved back-propagation(BP) neural network based on restricted boltzmann machine(RBM-IBPNN) is proposed for nonlinear systems modeling. First, the structure of BP neural network(BPNN) is optimized by using sensitivity analysis(SA) and mutual information(MI) of the hidden neurons. Namely when the SA value and the MI value of the hidden neurons satisfy the set standard, the corresponding neurons will be pruned, split or merged. second, the restricted boltzmann machine(RBM) is employed to perform parameters initialization of training on the IBPNN. Finally, the proposed RBM-IBPNN is evaluated on nonlinear system identification, lorenz chaotic time series prediction and the total phosphorus prediction problems. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RBM-IBPNN not only has faster convergence speed and higher prediction accuracy, but also realizes a more compact network structure.

TI  - Numerical Issues in Line Models Based on a Thin Wire Above a Lossy Ground
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the causes of numerical instabilities that might occur in transmission line models if the so-called image approximations are used for the evaluation of the per-unit-length parameters when the ground is assumed lossy and a wide frequency range is considered. To assess whether these instabilities are inherent to the formulation of the line parameters, results were compared with two well-established models: a full-wave model and a quasi-transverse electromagnetic approximation. Both approaches provided stable models throughout the whole frequency range. Two different methodologies are used for the determination of the modal propagation constant in a full-wave model leading to similar results. Time-domain responses based on the numerical Laplace transform and the method of characteristics were used to verify the accuracy and stability of the tested models. The input voltage considered for the time-domain responses included a small perturbation to excite the passivity violations found in the modeling using image approximations. Some aspects related to a full-wave model based on the method of characteristics using rational fitting are also presented.

AB  - The development of a flight simulator is a challenging work because of its complexity and tremendous cost. We have accomplished a flight simulator composed of PC cluster and non-flight-certified COTS components and have proved its fidelity and coordination characters as a flight training device. The main purpose of this project is to find a low cost solution to man-in-the-loop flight simulation while still accomplishing a competitive high level of quality. This paper describes the architecture of the flight simulator, the software development tools and hardware platform. These software and hardware constituted a PC based simulation environment and made the expense of the simulation application affordable. We also present the simulation modeling process. And for the integrity of the cueing system, we established a virtual prototype of the motion system which should support the cockpit of the simulator. The integrated system gave us a chance to testify the fidelity and coordination of the simulator. The validation method and simulation results are presented finally to show the feasible design based on PC to carry out flight simulation application with high quality and low cost.

AB  - Using estimation algorithm for system modeling, the model uncertainty is manifasted in the order and parameters, and the parameter uncertainty is the major problem for SISO system.The authors discuss the conventional formula for computing confidence region of estimated parameter value, point out in recursive algorithm the uncertainty of covariance matrix P(L). then an updated computation method of that is proposed in the paper.Because of the existence of parameter uncertainty, the evaluation of fit level between measured and simulated responses is also discussed in the paper. From a real modeling example of hydroturbine generating unit, the authors revealed the reason why the influence caused by uncertainty in system behavior of lower frequency band is more serious, and relieved the puzzle in model validation.

T2  - JOURNAL OF DEFENSE MODELING AND SIMULATION-APPLICATIONS METHODOLOGY TECHNOLOGY-JDMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an effective, reusable solution for modeling and simulation. The approach is to develop a Software Product Line (SPL) architecture that explicitly captures the commonality and variability in a family of similar simulation systems. First responders and incident management personnel need better training resources to prepare for possible catastrophic events, including natural disasters and terrorist attacks. Live exercises are often very expensive to organize and conduct. With modeling and simulation technology, simulation-based exercise and training models could be developed. The SPL technology enables the simulation system to easily adapt to multiple contexts and allows the simulation system to reconfigure quickly. SPL models can be developed at different levels of scope and depth to suit the emergency responder's needs. By reusing the system requirement analysis, software architectures, and design, the development time is shorter, the development cost is lower, and the quality is easily maintained.This paper focuses on the application of SPL technology to simulation systems of emergency facilities, such as hospital emergency rooms, on-site emergency triage stations, decontamination stations, first-aid stations, and ambulances. The paper also introduces a prototype simulation of the SPL member system - a hospital emergency room simulation system that has been developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The detailed modeling of a family of emergency response facility simulation systems is performed based on the Product Line Unified Modeling Language (UML)-based Software engineering (PLUS) method.

AB  - Adaptive filtering techniques have gained much popularity in the modeling of unknown system identification problem. These techniques can be classified as either iterative or direct. Iterative techniques include stochastic descent method and its improved versions in affine space. In this paper we present a comparative study of the least mean square (LMS) algorithm and some improved versions of LMS, more precisely the normalized LMS (NLMS), LMS-Newton, transform domain LMS (TDLMS) and affine projection algorithm (APA). The performance evaluation of these algorithms is carried out using adaptive system identification (ASI) model with random input signals, in which the unknown (measured) signal is assumed to be contaminated by output noise. Simulation results are recorded to compare the performance in terms of convergence speed, robustness, misalignment, and their sensitivity to the spectral properties of input signals. Main objective of this comparative study is to observe the effects of fast convergence rate of improved versions of LMS algorithms on their robustness and misalignment.

TI  - Executable Modeling Approach to Service Oriented Architecture Using SoaML in Conjunction with Extended DEVSML

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 11th IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC)

AB  - Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has been widely applied in a range of systems such as Embedded Systems, Enterprise Information Systems and Cyber Physical Systems. These systems nowadays show System of Systems (SoS) characteristics including large-scale, consisting of software and hardware components, and cooperative processes among independent systems. It is very important to validate functional requirements and evaluate non-functional requirements of systems precisely in earlier design phase by executable architecting methodology. This paper aims to provide an executable modeling approach to SOA by bringing together Model Driven Service Engineering (MDSE) with Service oriented architecture Modeling Language (SoaML) and Modeling & Simulation methodology based on Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS). First, the business architecture and system architecture are built with SoaML; then the Extended DEVS Modeling Language (E-DEVSML) is used as a model transformation intermediary to make SOA models executable in an automated code generation process; finally, the early validation and evaluation of this SOA are done through a generated DEVS simulation. To demonstrate the applicability of this approach we introduce an aircraft docking process in an airport scenario as the case study.

AB  - This paper proposes Multi resolution Wavelet Least Squares Support Vector Machine (MRWLS-SVM) network for the nonlinear system modeling. It composes a set of sub-wavelet least squares support vector machine networks with specified resolutions. The outputs of these sub-networks are aggregated via a set of weights to produce the network output. The structure of the MRWLS-SVM network is achieved using the fuzzy c-mean and the least squares support vector algorithm. The stability of the proposed network has been investigated using Lypunov stability theorem. The generalization of the proposed MRWLS-SVM network for the modeling purpose has investigated using two nonlinear systems.

AB  - Input or feature selection is one the most important steps of system modeling. Elimination of irrelevant variables can save time, money and can improve the precision of model that we are trying to discover. In Fuzzy System Modeling (FSM) approaches, input selection plays an important role too. The input selection algorithms that are under our investigation did not consider one crucial fact. An input variable may of may not be significant in a specific rule, not in overall system. In this paper, an input selection algorithm that takes this observation into account is proposed as an extension of the input selection algorithms found in the literature. The proposed algorithm is applied on a nonlinear function and successful results are achieved.

T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The discipline of component-based modeling and simulation offers promising gains in reducing cost, time, and the complexity of model development through the (re) use of modular components. Model-driven development suggests 1) the realization of a complex system using a conceptual model; 2) its automatic transformation into an executable form using transformation rules, and; 3) its automatic verification using a formal analysis technique for an accurate assessment of its correctness. Both approaches have numerous complementary benefits in rapid prototyping of complex systems using model reuse. In this paper, we propose a framework grounded in a combination of component-based and model-driven approaches to promote rapid prototyping of complex systems through the effective reuse of the simulation models. Our proposed process allows developers to 1) build or select existing components and compose them to formulate the conceptual models of complex systems; 2) automatically transform the conceptual models for the rapid implementation and simulation, and; 3) automatically verify them as per the requirement specifications. We propose the use of the extended finite-state machine (EFSM) as conceptual modeling formalism, anylogic simulation platform for the implementation, and probabilistic model checking technique using communicating sequential process (CSP) formalism for the verification. Finally, we present a case study of a real-time adaptive cruise control system to demonstrate the functionality of our framework. Our proposed component-based model-driven approach facilitates rapid prototyping and effective meaningful reuse of complex system models, which further accelerates the modeling, simulation, and analysis process of real-time systems and aids in complex engineering designs and implementations.

What will it mean to be able to deploy hundreds of sensors and data collectors running concurrently over months to gather very large and rich datasets of the physical, digital, and social aspects of software engineering organizations and the products and services those organizations create? How might such datasets change the types of research questions that can be addressed? What sort of tools will be needed to allow interdisciplinary communities of researchers to collaboratively analyse such datasets? How might such datasets help us understand the principles governing the interplay of physical, cyber, and social aspects of software engineering and its products, and automate aspects of such systems?

AB  - This work explores the integration and experimental evaluation of Fluid Computing principles with the Internet of Things (IoT) through the concept of Fluid Digital Twins (FDTs). They have been recently introduced as a cyber-physical paradigm designed to serve as intermediate software components aiming to enable seamless task migration, optimize resource utilization, and streamline interactions. Expanding upon this investigation, the research investigates FDTs within the context of the edge-to-cloud compute continuum. It models and explores the feasibility and ramifications of deploying and orchestrating FDTs and their dynamic capabilities across diverse computational facilities, from edge devices to cloud infrastructure. The paper outlines a new distributed FDT's modeling, presents the implemented prototype within a target reference use case together with its experimental evaluations, and analyzes challenges and opportunities inherent in this dynamic integration.

AB  - Software rejuvenation are developed to mitigate serious consequences caused by software aging mainly through restarting software systems. As such restart actions will temporarily stop the software service, how to select the restart time precisely becomes the core research issue. Current mainstream machine learning based software rejuvenation methods predict the trend of resource usage of hardware parameters to determine the restart time. However the actual aging status in many software systems are not strongly related to the resource usage of hardware parameters, it is not rigorous to define the aging status with single hardware parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time software rejuvenation decision method, named HARRD, where classic Weibull distribution in the field of reliability analysis is well utilized to simulate and model the state transition process of software aging. Then, based on this model with real-time resource usage of hardware monitoring parameters, and together integrating three model indicators, we construct the rejuvenation decision function using the analytic hierarchy process(AHP) to weight above parameters, which could finally be used as the rejuvenation decision basis for aging software systems. Our rejuvenation decision method could balance the unpredictable factors in software aging process by using accurate simulation models, and consider more indicators for rejuvenation time decision. The experimental results show that the software system based on our proposed method could achieve better software rejuvenation effects in terms of time consumption performance, average task processing speed and system stability.

AB  - Digital engineering is increasingly introduced for managing and supporting the development of systems for space. However, few academic teams have the competency needed to manage projects using digital engineering and systems engineering. The subject of this paper is an academic CubeSat project in which a variety of digital engineering techniques are used. The tailoring that has been applied to fit the academic environment including students from different disciplines and levels of maturity is described. This paper shows how a customized Scrum methodology for hardware and software integrated with a workflow in a digital tool environment has given positive results for both the team and the system development. This paper also discusses how to introduce new members to the team and how to train them to work with digital engineering as a multidisciplinary team. This paper presents how the systems engineering and project management activities have been integrated into the academic CubeSat project, evaluate how well this fusion worked, and estimate its potential to be used as a guide for other digital engineering projects.

TI  - Temporal Information Services in Large-Scale Vehicular Networks Through Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal information services are critical in implementing emerging intelligent transportation systems. Nevertheless, it is challenging to realize timely temporal data update and dissemination due to an intermittent wireless connection and a limited communication bandwidth in dynamic vehicular networks. Some previous studies have considered the temporal data dissemination in vehicular networks, but they are limited to the service region, which is inside the coverage of roadside units. To enhance system scalability, it is imperative to exploit the synergic effect of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-tovehicle (V2V) communications for providing efficient temporal information services in such an environment. With the above motivations, we propose a novel system architecture to enable efficient data scheduling in hybrid V2I/V2V communications by having the global knowledge of network resources of the system. On this basis, we formulate a temporal data upload and dissemination (TDUD) problem, aiming at optimizing two conflict objectives simultaneously, which are enhancing the data quality and improving the delivery ratio. Furthermore, we propose an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm called MO-TDUD, which consists of a decomposition scheme for han- filing multiple objectives, a scalable chromosome representation for TDUD solution encoding, and an evolutionary operator designed for TDUD solution reproduction. The proposed MO-TDUD can he adaptive to different requirements on data quality and delivery ratio by selecting the best solution from the derived Pareto solutions. Last but not least, we build the simulation model and implement MO-TDUD for performance evaluation. The comprehensive simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution.

TI  - A Stopwatch Automata-Based Approach to Schedulability Analysis of Real-Time Systems with Support for Fault Tolerance Techniques
T2  - THEORY AND ENGINEERING OF DEPENDABLE COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, DEPCOS-RELCOMEX 2021
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 16th International Conference on Dependability of Computer Systems (DepCoS-RELCOMEX)

AB  - During design of a fault tolerant real-time computer system (RTCS), it is necessary to guarantee that real-time constraints on system operation are met (i.e. all jobs are executed within deadlines) despite the increase of workload due to use of fault tolerance techniques (FTT). Checking these constraints can be reduced to schedulability analysis of workload which is modified with respect to the used set of FTT. In this paper, we propose an approach to such analysis, based on simulation of RTCS operation in order to produce a time diagram. Simulation model is automatically constructed from the general RTCS operation model (corresponding to a class of systems) and the RTCS configuration description. A generalization of stopwatch automata networks is chosen as a formal base for RTCS modeling, allowing to prove correctness properties for the models. The approach is implemented as an open-source tool system. Results of experimental evaluation are presented, demonstrating applicability of the approach to checking real-time constraints for solutions of the reliability allocation problem, extending the applicability of an existing evolutionary algorithm for this problem to a larger class of systems.

TI  - Evaluation of gray box thermostatic expansion valve mass flow models
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFRIGERATION-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DU FROID
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermostatic expansion valves (TXVs) are widely used in air-conditioning and commercial refrigeration systems. Accurate predictions of the refrigerant mass flow rate across a refrigeration cycle are desired in many engineering processes and applications such as a computer simulation model, for control purposes, or for fault detection and diagnostics (FDD). Several researchers have developed mass flow models for TXVs. This paper reviews and analyzes four gray-box TXV mass flow models in the literature and evaluates and compares their performance. Three of the models were developed for air-conditioners, but in the current work their applicability to refrigeration system modeling is assessed, with the use of normal and faulted laboratory data from a commercial walk-in cooler and a freezer. Model regression parameters are calculated during the training process with the use of parameter estimation techniques and a training dataset. The models are then used to predict the mass flow rates for several validation data points. Each of the models is found to perform well for the majority of the data points for the freezer, typically with errors below 10%, but application of the models to the cooler's dataset resulted in relatively large errors. The source of the model deviations includes the difficulty associated with the calculation of the TXV diaphragm force and the thermodynamic states of a two-phase refrigerant at the inlet of the valve. The presence of a liquid line receiver, which are common in refrigeration equipment, appears to cause some model deviation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.

TI  - Optimization of pump-valve combined regulation strategy for electric pump-fed system in a hybrid rocket motor
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in motor and battery technologies have driven the implementation of electric pumps in propulsion systems. Hybrid rocket motors, distinguished by simplified thrust modulation capabilities, substantially improve spacecraft maneuverability. The thrust regulation capacity can be enhanced through electric pump-fed systems that enable rapid, large-scale thrust adjustments. This study presents the design of a hydrogen peroxide electric pump-fed system for variable-thrust hybrid rocket motors. However, the system demonstrates significant parameter variations and encounters unsteady dynamic processes. During rapid parameter fluctuations, multiple subsystems demonstrate stiffness characteristics leading to numerical instability in solutions. Achieving accurate dynamic simulations while optimizing stable start-up processes and wide-range thrust regulation remains a critical challenge. In this research, simulation models of the basic components and the overall hydrogen peroxide electric pump-fed system were developed, with experimental validation performed through cold flow tests. Comparative analysis revealed less than 2 % deviation between experimental and simulated key parameters, confirming model validity. Building on validated multi-disciplinary models, an integrated optimization framework was established featuring: high-fidelity system modeling, efficient surrogate model development, multi-objective optimization, and multi-criteria evaluation for pump-valve coordinated control during start-up and thrust adjustment phases. Results indicate the multilayer perceptron-based optimization strategy decreases high-frequency current pulses by 27 % during start-up and reduces energy consumption by 5.4 % during thrust adjustment compared to conventional linear methods. These improvements significantly enhance system efficiency and operational safety. This work establishes a methodological framework for electric pump-fed system design and advances hybrid propulsion technology development.

TI  - Computing-Model and Computing-Hardware Selection for ICT Under Societal and Judicial Constraints
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses a formalization of aspects of Cyber-Sovereignty (CyS) for information and communication technology (ICT), linking them to technological trustworthiness and deriving an associated paradigm for hard- and software design. The upcoming 6G ICT standard is considered a keystone within modern society's increasing interconnectedness and automatization, as it provides the necessary technological infrastructure for applications such as the Metaverse or large-scale digital twinning. Since emerging technological systems increasingly affect sensitive human goods, hard- and software manufacturers must consider a new dimension of societal and judicial constraints in the context of technological trustworthiness. This article aims to establish a formalized theory of specific aspects of CyS, providing a paradigm for hard- and software engineering in ICT. This paradigm is directly applicable in formal technology assessment and ensures that the relevant facets of CyS - specifically, the principle of Algorithmic Transparency (AgT) - are satisfied. The framework follows an axiomatic approach. Particularly, the formal basis of our theory consists of four fundamental assumptions about the general nature of physical problems and algorithmic implementations. This formal basis allows for drawing general conclusions on the relation between CyS and technological trustworthiness and entails a formal meta-thesis on AgT in digital computing.

AB  - This paper addresses a problem of :continuous adaptation of the neural network in non-stationary environment. We have applied the extended Kalman,filter to the parameter, state and structure estimation of a recurrent radial basis function network. The architecture of a recurrent radial basis function network implements, a nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous inputs. Statistical criteria for structure adaptation (growing and pruning of hidden units and connections of the network) were derived using the statistics estimated by Kalman filter. Proposed algorithm is applied in non-stationary dynamic system modeling.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 27th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (IEEE SOCC)
CL  - Las Vegas, NV
AB  - Developing embedded parallel applications efficiently in modern single-chip many-core architectures is challenging. We present a novel methodology to facilitate crucial issues of parallel software development such as performance evaluation, speedup and bottleneck analysis, and system verification by taking the advantages of exploring many-core platforms in different abstraction levels altogether. To demonstrate our methodology, a design framework is proposed, consisting of a scalable many-core processor architecture and a hardware-independent software layer. Based on the scalable architecture, the prototype platform is also presented in Electronic System Level (ESL) and Register Transfer Level (RTL). The platform integrates sixteen Processing Elements (PEs) and a 4-by-4 mesh-based network with external memory. Our hardware-independent software layer aims at realistic parallel applications in the baremetal environment, i.e., without an Operating System (OS). With the on-chip communication library and system utilities, software built on top of the fast ESL many-core platform can be executed seamlessly on the RTL one. The analysis shows that our ESL simulation model provides relatively accurate performance metrics as compared with the RTL implementation, with up to 773.8 times faster in terms of simulation speed. In addition, we showcase the study of speedup and bottleneck analysis, which justifies the effectiveness of our methodology for embedded applications in many-core architectures.

AB  - The DNA barcoding is a promising technique for identifications of biological species based on a relatively short sequence of COI gene. A research area to improve the DNA barcoding is to study the classification techniques that utilize common properties of DNA and amino acid sequences such as variable lengths of gene sequences, and the comparison of different reference genes. In this study, we evaluate a classification model for DNA barcoding induced by genetic programming. The proposed method can be adapted for both DNA and amino acid sequences. The performance is evaluated by representing the two types of sequences and one based on their properties. The proposed method evaluates common significant sites on the reference genes which are useful to differentiate between species.

AB  - This article is devoted to the development of a security system for a group of mobile robots. A feature of this system is the combination of various methods of security, such as detecting attacks and establishing trusted devices in one system. Thanks to the developed data analysis method, it is possible to use the same set of parameters for different security purposes. This article describes the modular system architecture. In particular, much attention is paid to the module for detecting anomalous activity. This module conducts an initial assessment of the data and identifies the fact of abnormal behavior. The module converts statistical data into a certain type of probability distribution, which is suitable for the parameter and identifies deviations from standard indicators. If an anomaly is detected, then it gives information for further study to other modules. The network simulation results and the initial parameter estimation confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

TI  - ELM-Based Adaptive Neural Estimation for Actuator Faults Detection and Diagnosis of Nonlinear Uncertain Systems
T2  - 2017 29TH CHINESE CONTROL AND DECISION CONFERENCE (CCDC)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)
CL  - Chongqing, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Actuator, as a key component of control system, whose faults detection and diagnosis (FDD) is a complex problem due to system modeling uncertainty, so it is essential to propose advanced FDD scheme that accurately detects the faults. In this paper, we develop an actuator FDD scheme for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems based on extreme learning machine (ELM). In ELM, all parameters of hidden layer nodes need not be adjusted during learning, which may simply be assigned with random values, and the output weights only need to be adjusted. Within this scheme, two ELMs are employed to learn the unknown system function and unknown fault function. Firstly, a stable adaptive observer is designed to monitor faults in an online manner. Secondly, adaptive threshold is designed to make the fault detection, and deviation between the actual and the estimated system is known as residual. If the residual exceeds threshold at finite time denotes a fault occurrence. Different from the existing schemes, online computational efficiency and learning speed are improved considerably because ELM is introduced in this FDD scheme. Finally, a single-link robotic arm will be employed in simulation to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed FDD scheme.

TI  - Application of Multi-Software Engineering: A Review and a Kinetic Parameter Identification Case Study
T2  - PROCESSES
M3  - Review
AB  - Limitations regarding process design, optimization, and control often occur when using particular process simulators. With the implementation of connection methodologies, integrated tools could be made by coupling popular process simulation software with each other or with programming environments. In the current paper, we summarized and categorized the existing research regarding the application of multi-software engineering in the chemical industry, with an emphasis on software connections. CAPE-OPEN, COM, OPC, and native integration were discussed in detail, with the intention to serve as a guide for choosing the most suitable software combination and connection. These hybrid systems can handle complex user-defined problems and can be used for decision support, performing custom unit operations, operator training, process optimization, building control systems, and developing digital twins. In this work, we proposed the use of process simulator Aspen HYSYS linked together with the numeric computing platform MATLAB to solve a reaction kinetic parameter identification problem regarding the production of ?-valerolactone.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents two extensions for Statecharts: the Stochastic Statecharts, which use the original statecharts notation with a minor modification in the formal semantics and the Queuing Statecharts, which do not follow the pure Statecharts notation, but a join between Statecharts and queuing network representations. Some basic elements of Statecharts are redefined such as events and conditions, besides some concepts referring to the dynamic system behavior. The specification approaches show the basic behavior of a generic queuing system by means of templates and standard events. It is presented the PerformCharts, a new simulation environment based on Statecharts specification, which allows model solution using either Markov chains or the Network Simulator (NS).

TI  - Cyberphysical System With Virtual Reality for Intelligent Motion Recognition and Training
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose to build a comprehensive cyberphysical system (CPS) with virtual reality (VR) and intelligent sensors for motion recognition and training. We use both wearable wireless sensors (such as electrocardiogram, motion sensors) and nonintrusive wireless sensors (such as gait sensors) to monitor the motion training status. We first provide our CPS architecture. Then we focus on motion training from three perspectives: 1) VR-first we introduce how we can use motion capture camera to trace the motions; 2) gait recognition-we have invented low-cost small wireless pyroelectric sensor, which can recognize different gaits through Bayesian pattern learning. It can automatically measure gait training effects; and 3) gesture recognition-to quickly tell what motions the subject is doing, we propose a low-cost, low-complexity motion recognition system with 3-axis accelerometers. We will provide hardware and software design. Our experimental results validate the efficiency and accuracy of our CPS design.

TI  - Analyzing and visualizing information flow in heterogeneous component-based software systems
T2  - INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Component-based software engineering is aimed at managing the complexity of large-scale software development by composing systems from reusable parts. To understand or validate the behavior of such a system, one needs to understand the components involved in combination with understanding how they are configured and composed. This becomes increasingly difficult when components are implemented in various programming languages, and composition is specified in external artifacts. Moreover, tooling that supports in-depth system-wide analysis of such heterogeneous systems is lacking.Objective: This paper contributes a method to analyze and visualize information flow in a component based system at various levels of abstraction. These visualizations are designed to support the comprehension needs of both safety domain experts and software developers for, respectively, certification and evolution of safety-critical cyber-physical systems.Method: We build system-wide dependence graphs and use static program slicing to determine all possible end-to-end information flows through and across a system's components. We define a hierarchy of five abstractions over these information flows that reduce visual distraction and cognitive overload, while satisfying the users' information needs. We improve on our earlier work to provide interconnected views that support both systematic, as well as opportunistic navigation scenarios.Results: We discuss the design and implementation of our approach and the resulting views in a prototype tool called FlowTracker. We summarize the results of a qualitative evaluation study, carried out via two rounds of interview, on the effectiveness and usability of these views. We discuss a number of improvements, such as more selective information presentations, that resulted from the evaluation.Conclusion: The evaluation shows that the proposed approach and views are useful for understanding and validating heterogeneous component-based systems, and address information needs that could earlier only be met by manual inspection of the source code. We discuss lessons learned and directions for future work. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Machine learning-based test oracles for performance testing of cyber-physical systems: An industrial case study on elevators dispatching algorithms
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE-EVOLUTION AND PROCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The software of systems of elevators needs constant maintenance to deal with new functionality, bug fixes, or legislation changes. To automatically validate the software of these systems, a typical approach in industry is to use regression oracles, which execute test inputs both in the software version under test and in a previous software version. However, these practices require a long test execution time and cannot be re-used at different test phases. To deal with these issues, we propose Dispatching AlgoRIthm Oracle (DARIO), a test oracle that relies on regression machine-learning algorithms to detect both functional and non-functional problems of the system. The machine-learning algorithms of this oracle are trained by using data from previously tested versions to predict reference functional and non-functional performance values of the new versions. An empirical evaluation with an industrial case study demonstrates the feasibility of using our approach. A total of five regression learning algorithms were validated by using mutation testing techniques. For the context of functional bugs, the accuracy when predicting verdicts by DARIO ranged between 95% and 98%, across the different scenarios proposed. For the context of non-functional bugs, were competitive too, having an accuracy when predicting verdicts by DARIO ranged between 83% and 87%.

TI  - Design and Implementation of an AI-Enabled Sensor for the Prediction of the Behaviour of Software Applications in Industrial Scenarios
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the era of Industry 4.0 and 5.0, a transformative wave of softwarisation has surged. This shift towards software-centric frameworks has been a cornerstone and has highlighted the need to comprehend software applications. This research introduces a novel agent-based architecture designed to sense and predict software application metrics in industrial scenarios using AI techniques. It comprises interconnected agents that aim to enhance operational insights and decision-making processes. The forecaster component uses a random forest regressor to predict known and aggregated metrics. Further analysis demonstrates overall robust predictive capabilities. Visual representations and an error analysis underscore the forecasting accuracy and limitations. This work establishes a foundational understanding and predictive architecture for software behaviours, charting a course for future advancements in decision-making components within evolving industrial landscapes.

TI  - QoS-aware Metamorphic Testing: An Elevation Case Study
T2  - 2020 IEEE 31ST INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SOFTWARE RELIABILITY ENGINEERING (ISSRE 2020)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE 31st International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Elevators are among the oldest and most widespread transportation systems, yet their complexity increases rapidly to satisfy customization demands and to meet quality of service requirements. Verification and validation tasks in this context are costly, since they rely on the manual intervention of domain experts at some points of the process. This is mainly due to the difficulty to assess whether the elevators behave as expected in the different test scenarios, the so-called test oracle problem. Metamorphic testing is a thriving testing technique that alleviates the oracle problem by reasoning on the relations among multiple executions of the system under test, the so-called metamorphic relations. In this practical experience paper, we report on the application of metamorphic testing to verify an industrial elevator dispatcher. Together with domain experts from the elevation sector, we defined multiple metamorphic relations that consider domain-specific quality of service measures. Evaluation results with seeded faults show that the approach is effective at detecting faults automatically.

TI  - Nonlinear system modeling via knot-optimizing B-Spline networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - In using the B-spline network for nonlinear system modeling, owing to a lack of suitable theoretical results, it is quite difficult to choose an appropriate set of knot points to achieve a good network structure for minimizing, say, a minimum error criterion. In this paper, a novel knot-optimizing B-spline network is proposed to approximate general nonlinear system behavior. The knot points are considered to be independent variables in the B-spline network and are optimized together with the B-spline expansion coefficients. A simulated annealing algorithm with an appropriate search strategy is used as an optimization algorithm for the training process in order to avoid any possible local minima. Examples involving dynamic systems up to six dimensions in the input space to the network are solved by the proposed method to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.

TI  - Bayesian Neural Networks via MCMC: A Python-Based Tutorial
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bayesian inference provides a methodology for parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification in machine learning and deep learning methods. Variational inference and Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods are used to implement Bayesian inference. In the past few decades, MCMC sampling methods have faced challenges in being adapted to larger models (such as deep learning models) and big data problems. Advanced proposal distributions that incorporate gradients, such as a Langevin proposal distribution, provide a means to address some of the limitations of MCMC sampling for Bayesian neural networks. Furthermore, MCMC methods have typically been constrained to statisticians, and hence not well-known among deep learning researchers. We present a tutorial for MCMC methods that covers simple Bayesian linear and logistic models, and Bayesian neural networks. The aim of this tutorial is to bridge the gap between theory and implementation via Python code, given a general sparsity of libraries and tutorials. This tutorial provides code in Python with data and instructions that enable their use and extension. We provide results for selected benchmark problems showing the strengths and weaknesses of implementing the respective Bayesian models via MCMC. We highlight the challenges in sampling multi-modal posterior distributions for the case of Bayesian neural networks and the need for further improvement of convergence diagnosis methods.

TI  - A new real-time digital simulator of the turbine-alternator-grid system (STAR) for control apparatus closed-loop tests
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION
M3  - Article
AB  - A new generation of real-time digital simulator of the turbine-alternator-grid system (STAR) has been developed by ENEL-R&D-CRA in order to meet the demands of design review, commissioning test, preliminary assessment and final fine-tuning of excitation systems and voltage regulators, as well as of turbine actuators and speed governors. In particular, the electromechanical behavior of the overall turbine-alternator system, with respect to the electrical interconnected grid, may be theoretically studied, by using dynamic simulation models perfected with suitable details. The Control systems performances can also be easily checked and fine-tuned, in presence of small and large perturbations, both in normal and in emergency operating conditions. The simulator STAR, which has been successfully used also for the specialists training, can be effectively considered as a real turbine-alternator system. In fact its inputs may be directly connected to the interfaces of the excitation system and turbine governor; moreover, the simulator provides in output the process variables with the suitable format requested by the different control apparatuses.The paper describes the main design topics of the STAR simulator, as mainly regards its hardware and software architecture and the model framework of the turbine (steam, hydro or gas), alternator (with static and rotating exciter) and grid interconnection. The structure of the excitation control system and turbine speed governor, as well as the parameters configuration, runtime simulation, and data visualization procedures are shortly described. Finally, the STAR performances are shown through significant transient responses.

T2  - CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS AND CONTROL
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems and Control (CPS and C)
CL  - Peter Great St Petersburg Polytechn Univ, St Petersburg, RUSSIA
AB  - Facing the principal challenges of a Cyberphysical System (CPS) in a manufacturing environment by establishing an appropriate universal and scalable architecture the paper shows two explicit use cases of successfully established communication lines (horizontal and vertical) that integrate facilities derived from highly different domains, this all done at the Learning Factory at Graz University of Technology. In present time effective Cyberphysical Production Systems (CPPSs) live on the pervasive and seamless data integration of its data generators and receivers mainly facilitated by the Linkage Part of a CPPS. The connectivity, its semantic interoperability and the scalability need well-designed concepts and architectures because of the existence of too many standards and protocols. The challenge increases significantly if the network should be set up with facilities from many different suppliers and their proprietary standards. At the Learning Factory of Graz University of Technology the integration of most heterogeneous products at the office floor and at the shop floor is a major part of its research. The paper presents two solutions in form of "Use Cases," representing an innovative concept for both the vertical and the horizontal integration. Usage of an Enterprise Service Bus at the office floor and the installation of the "KEPServerEX"- middleware at the shop floor are selected core approaches for creating a representative CPPS.

T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study introduces FRIDA, a novel framework that integrates Requirements Engineering (RE) and DevOps practices into Robotic Process Automation (RPA), with a focus on optimizing human-computer interaction (HCI). The framework was designed using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) methodology and evaluated through a case study in an automation-driven department. Key results include an 83% reduction in processing time, an 81.25% decrease in error rates, and an 80% reduction in manual tasks, alongside improved compliance and scalability. The integration of RE and DevOps ensures a structured approach to requirement management and continuous delivery, while the emphasis on HCI enhances user-friendliness and adoption. FRIDA represents a significant advancement in RPA development, offering a robust, user-centric solution for optimizing automated processes. Future research should explore its application across diverse industries and the integration of advanced technologies like AI and machine learning to further enhance RPA capabilities.

AB  - For the modeling of large and complex systems of business processes, a flow oriented, graphical modeling framework based on Petri nets has emerged, taping the potentials of a qualitative and a quantitative analysis based on one and the same model. For the quantitative analysis of business process models (BPMs) representing realistically sized Enterprise organizations, traditional evaluation techniques (like discrete event simulation) tend to become practically intractable. To be able to cope with very complex models, therefore, we have developed a distributed execution mechanism based on the Time Warp distributed simulation protocol. A corresponding software fool was implemented based on the MPI communication library, thus portable to almost any distributed or parallel computing platform.In case studies performed on a 134 node Meiko CS-2 multiprocessor investigating real and hypothetical business organizations, this work demonstrates that parallel/distributed simulation techniques make the execution of very large models feasible: in situations where the simulation model has reached a complexity prohibitive to an execution on a single processor computer (e.g. due to memory constraints), the decomposition into smaller submodels to be executed on a parallel processor or a network of workstations remains the only means to get the simulation done. As such, a whole new class of (complex) BPM simulations becomes practically tractable, and traditional simulations can be accelerated dramatically. As an example, a BPM of a document flow system comprising 64 offices with an average of 1000 documents per office gains a 250 to 300 fold acceleration of the overall execution speed using 32 processors of the CS-2.

AB  - This paper presents a novel training method for estimating the parameters of retina models, such as integrate-and-fire (IF) or Poisson based. The presented models are constructed using a set of linear and nonlinear filters, which are described by basis functions and Taylor polynomials, respectively. This approach allows for the identification of a set of features that can be used for reproducing retina responses. By using the Bayesian-Laplace feature selection algorithm herein proposed, an efficient model with a reduced set of parameters is achieved. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to remove non-important features while still accurately reproducing retina responses. These results also show that the IF model is able to mimic the retina visual processing system using less parameters than the Poisson-based model.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Various countries in the world have issued policies on smart manufacturing and put forward relevant system architecture, including its hierarchy and component elements. However, from the perspective of implementation, it is necessary to further expand and study the relationship between the elements of the framework and the specific application scenarios. The focus of this study is to plan the specific implementation schemes from top-level planning for industrial practice in smart manufacturing on the basis of existing resources, elements, foundations, environment, standards, and norms. In this paper, industrial application scenarios for Smart Manufacturing Implementation System (SMIS) are deduced through a framework of SMIS. Then, an evaluation method for SMIS using Fuzzy DEMATEL is proposed. This study can provide guidance for enterprises to implement the scheme and steps of smart manufacturing. In addition, the industrial scenarios of SMIS proposed in this paper can provide reference for enterprises' top-level planning.

TI  - Simulation as a cloud service for short-run high throughput industrial print production using a service broker architecture
T2  - SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating end-to-end systems is uniquely challenging in industrial/commercial printing due to a large number of equipment combinations and customization needed for each customer and application. Moreover any mismatch in capacities may render multi-million dollar investments to zero returns on investment. Simulation can help foresee changes on the shop floor when demand changes. Providing a library of components that can be assembled together is the usual approach used by many simulation vendors which still leaves a simulation engineer in the loop to make it usable. We detail our experiences on implementing a prototype (private) cloud service using service broker architecture and a dynamic model generator. The service broker handles the heterogeneity associated with demand and equipment configurations whereas the dynamic model generator customizes a generic model based on inputs from the user. This helps avoiding rewiring of simulation models on each engagement. The schema and the necessary front and back-end codes all reside in the cloud and, therefore, users pay on a per use basis without worrying about the upgrade/update of software at their end. The service supports multi-tenancy which results in low costs per user and provides sharing of resource information yet restricting access to proprietary workflows and policies. A typical run costs a very small amount, which is affordable for even small-sized PSPs. We show the utility of our work in the context of educational book publishing to evaluate equipment changes needed when the current lumpy order demand stream changes to a highly fragmented demand stream. We also discuss how our work can be extended to several other domains such healthcare, transportation, 3D printing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A new approach to fuzzy wavelet system modeling
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose simple but effective two different fuzzy wavelet networks (FWNs) for system identification. The FWNs combine the traditional Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy model and discrete wavelet transforms (DWT). The proposed FWNs consist of a set of if-then rules and, then parts are series expansion in terms of wavelets functions. In the first system, while the only one scale parameter is changing with it corresponding rule number, translation parameter sets are fixed in each rule. As for the second system, DWT is used completely by using wavelet frames. The performance of proposed fuzzy models is illustrated by examples and compared with previously published examples. Simulation results indicate the remarkable capabilities of the proposed methods. It is worth noting that the second FWN achieves high function approximation accuracy and fast convergence.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we describe a simulation based health monitoring system test-bed for aircraft systems. The purpose of the test-bed is to provide a technology neutral basis for implementing and evaluation of reasoning systems on vehicle level and software architecture in support of the safety and maintenance process. This simulation test-bed will provide the sub-system level results and data which can be fed to the VLRS to generate vehicle level reasoning to achieve broader level diagnoses. This paper describes real-time system architecture and concept of operations for the aircraft major sub-systems. The four main components in the real-time test-bed are the aircraft sub-systems (e.g. battery, fuel, engine, generator, heating and lighting system) simulation model, fault insertion unit, health monitoring data processing and user interface. In this paper, we adopted a component based modelling paradigm for the implementation of the virtual aircraft systems. All of the fault injections are currently implemented via software. The fault insertion unit allows for the repeatable injection of faults into the system. The simulation test-bed has been tested with many different faults which were undetected on system level to process and detect on the vehicle level reasoning. This article also shows how one system fault can affect the overall health of the vehicle.

AB  - In learning and development, students need to be made aware of their slips and mistakes in terms of acquiring the required knowledge, skills and competencies, especially, in active learning approaches. However, assessments may not necessarily lead to an effective understanding of student's errors. Most assessors are required to measure the extent of student's accurate output in terms of exam answers or practical assessments. Areas of failure tend to be overlooked and for this reason, learners at-risk of achieving poor results can become careless when completing assessments. In the present study, we examine the following research questions: (i) How can we simulate the landscape of data on both individual and team behaviour in terms of failure in their projects? (ii) How can we develop ways of identifying at-risk students in each team and support them immediately? Therefore, in order to address this problem, this research proposes an agent-based simulation of student projects, which considers both individual and team errors. This model is created on the basis of particular characteristics of individual learners within the team. We assume that individuals working within a team are subject to recognition-primed decision making when confronted with particular problems to solve. The adjustment proposed by this model includes analysing the problem using prior knowledge and planning as well as judgements on the suitability of particular solutions. This research will be further developed to identify at-risk learners in terms of investigating the areas they want to develop to achieve their learning goals in particular subjects and especially in the software development fields.

TI  - Weighted Support Vector Echo State Machine for Multivariate Dynamic System Modeling
T2  - 2014 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ACC)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - American Control Conference
CL  - Portland, OR
AB  - Support vector echo state machine (SVESM) is a promising dynamic system modeling tool, which performed linear support vector regression (SVR) in the high dimension "reservoir" state space. A variant of SVESM, weighted support vector echo state machine (WSVESM) is proposed in this paper to deal with the multivariate dynamic system modeling problem. The historical observed data of the dynamic system are treated as multivariate time series, and the proposed WSVESM model is used to predict the time series. Different weights are allocated to the training data, and a multi-parameter solution path algorithm is introduced to determine the solution of WSVESM. Simulation results based on artificial and real-world examples show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

CP  - 22nd IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security (QRS)
CL  - Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Due to the proliferation of machine learning in various domains and applications, Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) was created to improve efficiency and adaptability by automating and operationalizing ML products. Because many machine learning application domains demand high levels of assurance, security has become a top priority and necessity to be involved at the beginning of ML system design. To provide theoretical guidance, we first introduce the Secure Machine Learning Operations (SecMLOps) paradigm, which extends MLOps with security considerations. We use the People, Processes, Technology, Governance and Compliance (PPTGC) framework to conceptualize SecMLOps, and to discuss challenges in adopting SecMLOps in practice. Since ML systems are often multi-concerned, analysis on how the adoption of SecMLOps impacts other system qualities, such as fairness, explainability, reliability, safety, and sustainability are provided. This paper aims to provide guidance and a research roadmap for ML researchers and organizational-level practitioners towards secure, reliable, and trustworthy MLOps.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy hyperbolic model for a class of complex systems, which is difficult to modeling. The fuzzy hyperbolic model is a nonlinear model in nature and can be easily derived from a set of fuzzy rules. It can also be seen as a feedforward neural network model and so we can identify the model parameters by BP-algorithm, We prove that the stable controller can be designed based on linear system theory. Two methods of designing the controller for the fuzzy hyperbolic model are proposed. The results of simulation support the effectiveness of the model and the control scheme.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 35TH IEEE CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL, VOLS 1-4
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control
CL  - KOBE, JAPAN
AB  - A fast and robust algorithm for training feedforward neural networks (FNNs) by using a variable forgetting factor and U-D factorization-based recursive prediction error (RPE) method is proposed. In comparison with the backpropagation (BP) and RPE based learning algorithms, the proposed algorithm, called UD-RPE, can provide much more accurate learning results in fewer iterations with fewer hidden nodes and improve convergence rate and numerical stability (robustness). In addition, it is less sensitive to start-up parameters, such as initial weights and initial covariance matrix, and the randomness in the observed data. It also has good generalization ability and need less learning time. Simulation results of nonlinear dynamic system modeling and identification show that the algorithm proposed here is an effective and efficient learning algorithm for FNNs.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
M3  - Article
AB  - Electronics systems for modern vehicles must be designed to meet stringent requirements on real-time performance, safety, power consumption, and security. Hardware/software codesign techniques allow system designers to create platforms that can both meet those requirements and evolve as components and system requirements evolve. Design methodologies have evolved that allow systems-of-systems to be built from subsystems that are themselves embedded computing systems. Software performance is a key metric in the design of these systems. A number of methods-of-methods for the analysis of worst case execution time have been developed. More recently, we have developed new methods for software performance analysis based on design of experiments. Formal methods can be used to verify system properties. Systems must be architected to maintain their integrity in the face of attacks from the Internet. All of these techniques build upon generic hardware/software codesign techniques but with significant adaptations to the technical and economic context of vehicle design.

TI  - Verification of intelligent scheduling based on deep reinforcement learning for distributed workshops via discrete event simulation
T2  - ADVANCES IN PRODUCTION ENGINEERING & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Production scheduling, which directly influences the completion time and throughput of workshops, has received extensive research. However, due to the high cost of real-world production verification, most literature did not verify the optimized scheduling scheme in real-world workshops. This paper studied the verification of scheduling schemes and environments, using a discrete event simulation (DES) platform. The aim of this study is to provide an efficient way to verify the correctness of scheduling environments established by programming languages and scheduling results obtained by intelligent algorithms. The system architecture of scheduling verification based on DES is established. The modelling approach via DES is proposed by designing parametric workshop generation, flexible production control, and real-time data processing. The popular distributed permutation flowshop scheduling problem is selected as a case study, where the optimal scheduling scheme obtained by a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is fed into the production simulation model in Plant Simulation software. The experiment results show that the proposed scheduling verification approach can validate the scheduling scheme and environment effectively. The utilization and Gantt charts clearly show the performance of scheduling schemes. This work can help to verify the scheduling schemes and programmed scheduling environment efficiently without costly real-world validation.

TI  - Towards Horizontal Architecture for Autonomic M2M Service Networks
T2  - FUTURE INTERNET
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, increasing number of industrial application cases rely on the Machine to Machine (M2M) services exposed from physical devices. Such M2M services enable interaction of physical world with the core processes of company information systems. However, there are grand challenges related to complexity and "vertical silos" limiting the M2M market scale and interoperability. It is here expected that horizontal approach for the system architecture is required for solving these challenges. Therefore, a set of architectural principles and key enablers for the horizontal architecture have been specified in this work. A selected set of key enablers called as autonomic M2M manager, M2M service capabilities, M2M messaging system, M2M gateways towards energy constrained M2M asset devices and creation of trust to enable end-to-end security for M2M applications have been developed. The developed key enablers have been evaluated separately in different scenarios dealing with smart metering, car sharing and electric bike experiments. The evaluation results shows that the provided architectural principles, and developed key enablers establish a solid ground for future research and seem to enable communication between objects and applications, which are not initially been designed to communicate together. The aim as the next step in this research is to create a combined experimental system to evaluate the system interoperability and performance in a more detailed manner.

CP  - 4th International Conferene Watershed Management
CL  - Shenzhen, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Best Management Practices (BMPs) are measures for mitigating nonpoint source (NPS) pollution caused mainly by stormwater runoff. Established urban and newly developing areas must develop cost effective means for restoring or minimizing impacts, and planning future growth. Prince George's County in Maryland, USA, a fast-growing region in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, has developed a number of tools to support analysis and decision making for stormwater management planning and design at the watershed level. These tools support watershed analysis, innovative BMPs, and optimization. Application of these tools can help achieve environmental goals and lead to significant cost savings.This project includes software development that utilizes GIS information and technology, integrates BMP processes simulation models, and applies system optimization techniques for BMP planning and selection. The system employs the ESRI ArcGIS (c) as the platform, and provides GIS-based visualization and support for developing networks including sequences of land uses, BMPs, and stream reaches. The system also provides interfaces for BMP placement, BMP attribute data input, and decision optimization management. The system includes a stand-alone BMP simulation and evaluation module, which complements both research and regulatory nonpoint source control assessment efforts, and allows flexibility in the examining various BMP design alternatives. Process based simulation of BMPs provides a technique that is sensitive to local climate and rainfall patterns. The system incorporates a meta-heuristic optimization technique to find the most cost-effective BMP placement and implementation plan given a control target, or a fixed cost. A case study is presented to demonstrate the application of the Prince George's County system. The case study involves a highly urbanized area in the Anacostia River (a tributary to Potomac River) watershed southeast of Washington, DC. An innovative system of management practices is proposed to minimize runoff, improve water quality, and provide water reuse opportunities. Proposed management techniques include bioretention, green roof, and rooftop runoff collection (rain barrel) systems. The modeling system was used to identify the most cost-effective combinations of management practices to help minimize frequency and size of runoff events and resulting combined sewer overflows to the Anacostia River.

TI  - Enhancing Secure Development in Globally Distributed Software Product Lines: A Machine Learning-Powered Framework for Cyber-Resilient Ecosystems
T2  - CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
M3  - Article
AB  - Embracing software product lines (SPLs) is pivotal in the dynamic landscape of contemporary software development. However, the flexibility and global distribution inherent in modern systems pose significant challenges to managing SPL variability, underscoring the critical importance of robust cybersecurity measures. This paper advocates for leveraging machine learning (ML) to address variability management issues and fortify the security of SPL. In the context of the broader special issue theme on innovative cybersecurity approaches, our proposed ML-based framework offers an interdisciplinary perspective, blending insights from computing, social sciences, and business. Specifically, it employs ML for demand analysis, dynamic feature extraction, and enhanced feature selection in distributed settings, contributing to cyber-resilient ecosystems. Our experiments demonstrate the framework's superiority, emphasizing its potential to boost productivity and security in SPLs. As digital threats evolve, this research catalyzes interdisciplinary collaborations, aligning with the special issue's goal of breaking down academic barriers to strengthen digital ecosystems against sophisticated attacks while upholding ethics, privacy, and human values.

TI  - Enhanced data efficiency using deep neural networks and Gaussian processes for aerodynamic design optimization
T2  - AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Adjoint-based optimization methods are attractive for aerodynamic shape design primarily due to their computational costs being independent of the dimensionality of the input space and their ability to generate high-fidelity gradients that can then be used in a gradient-based optimizer. This makes them very well suited for high-fidelity simulation based aerodynamic shape optimization of highly parametrized geometries such as aircraft wings. However, the development of adjoint-based solvers involve careful mathematical treatment and their implementation require detailed software development. Furthermore, they can become prohibitively expensive when multiple optimization problems are being solved, each requiring multiple restarts to circumvent local optima. In this work, we propose a machine learning enabled, surrogate-based framework that replaces the expensive adjoint solver, without compromising on predicting predictive accuracy. Specifically, we first train a deep neural network (DNN) from training data generated from evaluating the high-fidelity simulation model on a model-agnostic design of experiments on the geometry shape parameters. The optimum shape may then be computed by using a gradient-based optimizer coupled with the trained DNN. Subsequently, we also perform a gradient-free Bayesian optimization, where the trained DNN is used as the prior mean. We observe that the latter framework (DNN-BO) improves upon the DNN-only based optimization strategy for the same computational cost. Overall, this framework predicts the true optimum with very high accuracy, while requiring far fewer high-fidelity function calls compared to the adjoint-based method. Furthermore, we show that multiple optimization problems can be solved with the same machine learning model with high accuracy, to amortize the offline costs associated with constructing our models. Our methodology finds applications in the early stages of aerospace design. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Wearable and implantable medical devices are being increasingly deployed for diagnosis, monitoring, and to provide therapy for critical medical conditions. Such medical devices are examples of safety-critical, cyber-physical systems. In this paper we focus on insulin infusion systems (IISs), which are used by diabetics to maintain safe blood glucose levels. These systems support wireless features introducing potential vulnerabilities. Although these devices go through rigorous safety certification processes, these are not able to mitigate security threats. Based on published literature, attackers can remotely command to inject an incorrect amount of insulin thereby posing threat to a patient's life. While prior work based on formal methods have been proposed to detect potential attack vectors using different forms of static analysis, these have limitations in preventing attacks at run-time. Also, as these devices are safety critical, it is not possible to apply security patches, when new types of attacks are detected, due to the need for recertification.This paper addresses these limitations by developing a formal framework for the detection of cyber-physical attacks on an IIS. First, we propose a wearable device that senses the familiar ECG to detect attacks. Thus, this device is separate from the insulin infusion system, ensuring no need for recertification of IISs. To facilitate the design of this device, we establish a correlation of ECG intervals and blood glucose levels using statistical analysis. This helps us in proposing a framework for security policy mining using the developed statistical analysis. This paves the way for the design of formal verification monitors for IISs for the first time. We perform performance evaluation of the verification monitor, which proves the technical feasibility for the design of wearable devices for attack detection of IISs. Our approach is amenable to the application of security patches, when new attack vectors are detected, making the approach ideal for run-time monitoring of medical CPSs.

CL  - Bogota, COLOMBIA
AB  - The concept of the intelligent Digital Twin focuses on automatic model creation and model extension for a product throughout its lifecycle using artificial intelligence. To create an intelligent Digital Twin, the Digital Twin architecture must also include software services that support machine learning algorithms. These software services must have two characteristics. First, an interface to the real environment to dynamically receive feedback from an existing product or a product under development. Second, machine learning algorithms that analyze and manage the Digital Twin's models based on feedback from the real product. In this paper, we present the concept and implementation of a software service within the intelligent Digital Twin's architecture for automated requirements modeling as well as for modeling of the product system architecture. Since medical devices differ significantly in their applied technology, area of use, and application, the requirement engineering of medical devices needs to identify and specify the critical design requirements for each product individually. This makes automated requirement engineering and Model-based-Systems Engineering of medical devices very challenging. The implemented intelligent software service meets these challenges for product design in the healthcare sector. Copyright (C) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - In the omnipresent discussion on the role of ICT in education, the contribution of computer science education is often mentioned, but not always understood. This paper discusses the relation between ICT education and computer science education and the benefits of understanding the fundamental concepts and ideas of Computer Science (CS). Computer science is a dynamic and highly innovative science, whose products make a significant contribution to the development of the so-called "Digital Society." How should computer science teaching be adapted to the continuous technical further developments? Based on the outcomes of several research projects, this paper will outline how innovations in computer science can be taken up in order to improve the teaching of computer science. i.e., the topic of "databases" will in future offer a broader perspective on how to deal with data in the sense of "data management". Agile methods, which are known from professional software development, can support learners and teachers, despite difficult school conditions, to better achieve the objectives in project based teaching. Programmable microcontrollers extend the view of computers as standing on a desktop towards ubiquitous embedded or also cyber-physical systems, which enable new and motivating approaches for the design of computer science lessons in the context of physical computing. As a target perspective, pupils should be able to understand the phenomena of the "digital society", but also to be involved in the design of them in accordance to their needs.

AB  - Sexual and asexual forms of plants and animals often coexist in the same population. In such cases, the assessment of genotypic identity among individuals is vital for valid biological interpretation of population and evolutionary processes. Several methods are used for identifying clones based on genetical marker data. The only method that detects which multilocus genotypes are likely to be clones has limitations in statistical power. We present a program (MLGSim) that, using a simulation approach, calculates significance values for the likelihood that a multilocus genotype observed more than once in a population is the result of sexual reproduction.

AB  - Fault detection and accommodation plays a very important role in critical applications. A new software redundancy approach based on an adaptive neurofuzzy system (ANFIS) is introduced. An ANFIS model is used to detect the fault while another model is used to accommodate it. An accurate plant model is assumed with arbitrary additive faults. The two models are trained online using a gradient-based approach. The accommodation mechanism is based on matching the output of the plant with the output of a reference model. Furthermore. the accommodation mechanism does not assume a special type of system or nonlinearity. Simulation studies prove the effectiveness of the new system even when a severe failure occurs. Robustness to noise and inaccuracies in the plant model are also demonstrated.

AB  - The paper presents the system architecture, development and prototype implementation of a new integrated system for simulation of automated industrial processes using advanced technologies, in accordance with CPS/Industry 4.0 principles. The need to develop such a system is underscored by the interest of the educational stakeholders: students, faculty members, high-level industry partners, for an educational system to be used in specialized training in interdisciplinary areas including edge systems in terms of modern control technologies, open systems available to be reconfigured upon request with other technologies and mission-critical applications for different process engineering fields such as key energy applications. The process simulator can be operated in educational environments as follows: as didactic equipment for learning and deepening PLCs programming languages skills; equipment for testing various complex scenarios of some energy processes while allowing on-demand reconfiguration for some industrial systems which cannot be implemented in reality due to the high cost and/or the operational safety. Given its properties flexibility, interoperability, open architecture, compatibility in communication, friendly human-machine interface and industrial applications, ASID is able to cover a vast array of teaching scenarios as well as serve as a platform for control algorithm implementation and testing. The modular configuration allows for increased versatility and flexibility and the long-term competitiveness of the final demonstrator is assured through hardware and software updates.

TI  - An Efficient and Scalable Simulation Model for Autonomous Vehicles With Economical Hardware
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Autonomous vehicles rely on sophisticated hardware and software technologies for acquiring holistic awareness of their immediate surroundings. Deep learning methods have effectively equipped modern self-driving cars with high levels of such awareness. However, their application requires high-end computational hardware, which makes utilization infeasible for the legacy vehicles that constitute most of today's automotive industry. Hence, it becomes inherently challenging to achieve high performance while at the same time maintaining adequate computational complexity. In this paper, a monocular vision and scalar sensor-based model car is designed and implemented to accomplish autonomous driving on a specified track by employing a lightweight deep learning model. It can identify various traffic signs based on a vision sensor as well as avoid obstacles by using an ultrasonic sensor. The developed car utilizes a single Raspberry Pi as its computational unit. In addition, our work investigates the behavior of economical hardware used to deploy deep learning models. In particular, we herein propose a novel, computationally efficient, and cost-effective approach. The designed system can serve as a platform to facilitate the development of economical technologies for autonomous vehicles that can be used as part of intelligent transportation or advanced driver assistance systems. The experimental results indicate that this model can achieve real-time response on a resource-constrained device without significant overheads, thus making it a suitable candidate for autonomous driving in current intelligent transportation systems.

TI  - ECG Modeling for Simulation of Arrhythmias in Time-Varying Conditions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present article proposes an ECG simulator that advances modeling of arrhythmias and noise by introducing time-varying signal characteristics. The simulator is built around a discrete-time Markov chain model for simulating atrial and ventricular arrhythmias of particular relevance when analyzing atrial fibrillation (AF). Each state is associated with statistical information on episode duration and heartbeat characteristics. Statistical, time-varying modeling of muscle noise, motion artifacts, and the influence of respiration is introduced to increase the complexity of simulated ECGs, making the simulator well suited for data augmentation in machine learning. Modeling of how the PQ and QT intervals depend on heart rate is also introduced. The realism of simulated ECGs is assessed by three experienced doctors, showing that simulated ECGs are difficult to distinguish from real ECGs. Simulator usefulness is illustrated in terms of AF detection performance when either simulated or real ECGs are used to train a neural network for signal quality control. The results show that both types of training lead to similar performance.

TI  - Automating Test Oracle Generation in DevOps for Industrial Elevators

CP  - 29th IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Orona is a world-renowned elevators developer. During elevators' lives, their software continues to evolve, e.g., due to hardware obsolescence, requirements changes, vulnerabilities, and bug corrections. Such continuous evolution demands the continuous testing of industrial elevators with the minimum manual effort possible. To this end, we present a tool, whose core component is a domain-specific language (DSL) with which a user can specify test oracles at a higher level of abstraction and independent of a testing level. The DSL also supports specifying uncertainty-aware test oracles to test elevators under various uncertainties inherent in them. Finally, the DSL is also equipped with test oracle generation that generates test oracle code automatically at the different DevOps testing levels (i.e., Software and Hardware-in-the-Loop test levels, and in operation) to enable reuse of test oracles across these levels. We evaluated this DSL with an industrial elevators case study at Orona's site to specify and generate test oracles. The evaluation showed that the high expressiveness of the DSL permits the high-level definition of test oracles in our industrial context. Based on the industrial application, we discuss our experiences and lessons learned.

TI  - Bionic Underwater Vehicle: A Data-Driven Disturbance Rejection Control Framework
T2  - IEEE ROBOTICS & AUTOMATION MAGAZINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbances caused by unknown dynamics and environmental factors render the automatic control of underwater vehicles extremely challenging. These effects are complex, time varying, and difficult to model accurately, leading to possible instability in the control process. This article focuses on the disturbance rejection problem of an underactuated bionic underwater vehicle (BUV). A novel control approach that combines the robustness of a model predictive controller with the modeling capabilities of a learning-based observer is proposed. More specifically, a practical Gaussian process (GP)-based disturbance observer is designed for online disturbance estimation. The interactive prediction results are integrated into a model predictive controller to obtain a refined dynamics model. The control framework optimally solves for the optimal control output to achieve control at the dynamics level. The proposed approach realizes disturbance rejection control while ensuring real-time application, constraint satisfaction, and recursive feasibility under complicated disturbances. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed approach are verified through simulations and real-world experiments.

TI  - Reliability Engineering in a Time of Rapidly Converging Technologies

M3  - Article
AB  - The convergence of technologies is happening across various aspects, such as communication, computing, medicine, and transportation. The smartphone is a perfect example of convergence, packing features, such as a camera, GPS, artificial intelligence, and Internet connectivity into one sleek device. Autonomous driving is another good example. In a time of rapidly converging technologies, reliability engineering must take into account the potential for cyber threats, the need for cyber trust, the importance of cyber security, and the criticality of cyber resilience. In this way, reliability engineers can ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer systems and networks in the face of evolving threats and changing technologies. In this article, we introduce the challenges and current progress of reliability engineering in emerging technologies, including practices and applications of cyber trust and security, AI-empowered autonomous driving systems, modern mobile networks, blockchains and distributed ledger technologies, prognostic and health management, integrated circuit and hardware, and enterprise cybersecurity and threat hunting.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces a novel identifier scheme for identification of nonlinear systems with disturbances. The identification process is carried out in two steps: an offline procedure and an online procedure. The method comprises of an automatic structure generating phase using entropybased technique. The accuracy of the model is suitably controlled using the entropy measure. The parameter learning phase uses the backpropagation technique. To improve the accuracy and also for generalization of the model to handle different data sets, Differential Evolution technique is employed whereby the parameters of the model are suitably tuned using evolutionary technique. A semi serial-parallel model is introduced to improve the online identification process in the presence of noisy data. The proposed mechanism is utilized and compared against the classical Sugeno, adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) modeling and Laguerre Network-Based Fuzzy System for the identification of a nonlinear benchmark problem. In addition, the proposed technique is also used to model a rotary wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) from real test input-output data. The modeling performance and generalization capability are seen to be superior with our method.

TI  - Robust pollution source parameter identification based on the artificial bee colony algorithm using a wireless sensor network
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pollution source parameter identification (PSPI) is significant for pollution control, since it can provide important information and save a lot of time for subsequent pollution elimination works. For solving the PSPI problem, a large number of pollution sensor nodes can be rapidly deployed to cover a large area and form a wireless sensor network (WSN). Based on the measurements of WSN, least-squares estimation methods can solve the PSPI problem by searching for the solution that minimize the sum of squared measurement noises. They are independent of the measurement noise distribution, i.e., robust to the noise distribution. To search for the least-squares solution, population-based parallel search techniques usually can overcome the premature convergence problem, which can stagnate the single-point search algorithm. In this paper, we adapt the relatively newly presented artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to solve the WSN-based PSPI problem and verifies its feasibility and robustness. Extensive simulation results show that the ABC and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm obtained similar identification results in the same simulation scenario. Moreover, the ABC and the PSO achieved much better performance than a traditionally used single-point search algorithm, i.e., the trust-region reflective algorithm.

TI  - Dynamic performance prediction and experimental analysis of wet clutch actuator considering thermal flow characteristics
T2  - FLOW MEASUREMENT AND INSTRUMENTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydraulic actuator system (HAS) for wet clutches in heavy-duty vehicle transmissions is required to have a fast response and high precision in the pressure regulation procedure. Conventional pressure control valves for HAS are almost slide spool structures, which perform a large flow force at a high flow rate. An open -center spool structure is designed and developed in this paper, which is a combination of a traditional slide spool and a valve sleeve. It has an orifice -groove combination throttling orifice, which can take into account the large through -flow capacity and small flow force. Firstly, to deeply understand the mechanism of pressure variation in the clutch chamber, a high-fidelity dynamic characteristic mathematical model of HAS considering the oil temperature is proposed. Secondly, the functional relationship between the oil temperature on the medium physical property parameters and the orifice thermal flow parameters in the model is deduced in detail. An experimental bench to measure the pressure valve dynamic performance and actuator pressure regulation characteristics in a wide temperature domain is then designed and implemented to validate the accuracy of the simulation model. Finally, the mechanisms of oil temperature and system pressure on pressure impact and pressure response are quantitatively analyzed in association with a supervised learning algorithm. The feasible domains of the two adjustable variables are also explored. This study provides a new perspective on dynamic control and energy saving of HAS pressure valves and a new method for the prediction of HAS performance under complicated operating conditions.

AB  - Given a complex system, simulating the behavior of the system under various conditions and inputs is a common requirement in different domains. Designing a simulator by non-domain expert is not an easy task. However, the vast amount of performance related parameters that can be monitored on any physical system can help in probabilistic modeling of the system. Accurate modeling of a complex system requires the identification of dependency among the individual components. These dependencies can be deduced by probabilistic analysis of the performance parameters generated by the physical system. We propose constrained Hill Climbing for structure learning of a Bayesian Network to learn the dependency among internal components of the system. Dependency graph, thus generated will act as a basis for developing a prototype simulator. Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines are compared with the proposed constrained hill climbing to deduce the mathematical relation between the interdependent components. Two prototype simulators are designed, one for a complex large-scale storage system and another for a group of computer servers. Behavior of both the physical systems is tested on workload traces. The normalized mean absolute error for simulation of storage systems and server was 4.6% & 3.75% respectively. Results indicate that the proposed simulation prototyping can be a useful and unique way of understanding complex systems without the help of a domain expert.

AB  - This position paper describes the context, the goal, the strategy and the tactics of the ERATO MMSD project (2016-2022). The project aims at enhanced quality assurance measures for industry products like cars. In doing so, we follow a recent trend and exploit formal methods, a body of mathematical techniques originally developed for computer systems. However, there are fundamental gaps in application of formal methods to industry products: additional concerns in industry products such as continuous dynamics of physical components and quantitative measures such as probability, time, and cost make problems fundamentally different from those about software. Formal methods that accommodate these concerns is an active research area, which shows that it is a hard problem. There are several successful theoretical developments in this direction. They typically combine one individual technique with one specific concern, such as hybrid automata that extend automata with continuous dynamics. Our project aims to contribute to this hard problem in a unique way. In our project we will take a unique metamathematical strategy to bridging the gaps: instead of creating one technique for each concern, we want to find a meta-level theory that describes how to develop such techniques for many potential concerns in general. Through this strategy, together with our emphasis on real-world applications in industry, we expect a new prototype of applied mathematics will emerge. In this prototype, abstraction and genericity-characteristics of modern mathematics that are not often associated with application-are turned into crucial advantages in applications.

AB  - Many real-world systems exhibit complex nonlinear characteristics and cannot be treated satisfactorily using linear systems theory. A neural network which has the ability to learn sophisticated nonlinear relationships provides an ideal means of modelling complicated nonlinear systems. This paper addresses the issues related to the identification of nonlinear discrete-time dynamic systems using neural networks. Three network architectures, namely the multi-layer perceptron, the radial basis function network and the functional-link network, are presented and several learning or identification algorithms are derived. Advantages and disadvantages of these structures are discussed and illustrated using simulated and real data. Particular attention is given to the connections between existing techniques for nonlinear systems identification and some aspects of neural network methodology, and this demonstrates that certain techniques employed in the neural network context have long been developed by the control engineering community.

AB  - In this paper, a novel adaptive neuro-fuzzy modeling system is proposed for solving system modeling problems. Two phases are included in our approach. In the first phase, a merge-based fuzzy self-clustering algorithm is used to automatically partition the sample data set into fuzzy clusters. Initial clusters are generated rapidly and similar clusters are merged together gradually based on similarity and distortion measures. TSK-type fuzzy rules associated with generated clusters are extracted. Then, the obtained rules are refined by a fuzzy neural network in the second phase. To speed up the convergence of learning, we develop a hybrid learning algorithm which combines a recursive SVD-based least squares estimator and the gradient descent method. Experimental results have shown that our method is more efficient than other methods.

AB  - Pneumatic actuators exhibit highly nonlinear characteristics due to air compressibility, significant friction presence and the nonlinearities of control valves. The unknown nonlinear parameters can not be directly measured once the actuators have been manufactured and assembled, which causes a great difficulty in pneumatic system modeling and control. A learning algorithm has been developed in this paper to identify the unknown pneumatic system parameters. The algorithm is initially developed and tested using the data generated by simulations. Then the algorithm has been extended onto the parameter identification using the data obtained from the real system measurement. The results revealed the characteristics of uneven distribution of friction parameters which are position, velocity, moving direction dependent. The results obtained in the paper can provide the manufacturers with the observation to the characteristics inside pneumatic cylinders.

AB  - Although Modeling and Simulation is successfully applied for several decades, the community only established a handful of M&S specific standards. Although the standards were applied enabling worldwide distributed simulation applications, in particular in the training application domain of military simulation systems, the general success of M&S standard efforts and their potential for general applicability has been debated repeatedly during several conferences and workshop. This collection of position statements discusses related questions, such as, "What makes M&S special that we need M&S standards," "Are M&S standards truly different from Software Engineering Standards," and "What metrics can be used to measure M&S standard success," and tries to contribute to establishing a methodological approach to identify future M&S standard needs. These position statements have been contributed in preparation of a panel discussion and edited for the supporting proceedings.

AB  - Inferring a correct state machine of a protocol implementation is an important problem in software engineering and security domains. The protocol state machine inference method can be widely used in various security applications, such as software vulnerability detection, intrusion detection system, protocol implementation fingerprinting, and protocol reversing. In this paper, we propose an advanced technique to efficiently infer protocol state machine. The proposed technique is evaluated by inferring a state machine of a SCADA protocol implementation. The SCADA system is one of the most critical cyber-physical systems, which has high importance, and the proposed technique can be used for various security applications in these systems. The proposed technique is based on Angluin's L* algorithm, but we advance the algorithm using the Hybrid Teacher which uses both the random sampling oracle and the modified W-method. We demonstrate that the proposed technique can learn a correct state machine with a fewer number of queries than existing techniques, through experiments on an application of the DNP3 protocol, which is widely used in the SCADA system.

TI  - Predicting the performance of synchronous discrete event simulation systems

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD 2001)
CL  - SAN JOSE, CA
AB  - In this paper we propose a model to predict the performance of synchronous discrete event simulation. The model considers parameters including the number of active objects per cycle, event execution granularity and communication cost. We derive a single formula that predicts the performance of synchronous simulation.We have benchmarked several VHDL circuits on SGI Origin 2000. The benchmark results show that the prediction model explains more than 90% of parallel simulation execution time. We also measure the effect of computation granularity over performance. The benchmark results show that although higher granularity can have better speedup because of dominance of computation over communication, the computational granularity cannot overshadow the inherent synchronization cost. This model can be used to predict the speed-up expected for synchronous simulation, and to decide whether it is worthwhile to use synchronous simulation before actually implementing it.

AB  - Industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS) research combines many fields, including mechatronics, electrical, electronic, network, systems and software engineering. ICPS testbeds are often prohibitively expensive to purchase, store and maintain, and tied to vendor-specific tool chains, making them infeasible for small-scale experimental and student-led research. With the rising popularity of 3D printing and ubiquitous computing, it is now possible to rapidly and inexpensively build model ICPS for lab research. This paper presents the "from-scratch" construction of an open-source 3D-printed smart wind turbine as a case study. We cover 3D modelling and printing of the wind turbine parts, the hardware-software interfacing and controller design using Arduino and the ESP8266 embeddedWiFi controller. Interested readers can build a similar smart wind turbine by downloading the guidance and resource files linked to this document within days.The smart wind turbine also serves as a rich ICPS research and education testbed to enable next-generation learning. In addition to discipline-specific tasks like incrementally optimising the 3D model, the interfacing and/or controller design, students and researchers can also use it for interdisciplinary research exploration. As an example, we show how the design and development of the smart wind turbine can be used to study, learn, and research requirements traceability. We employ graph databases to effectively model, represent, manage and trace requirements throughout the development of the smart wind turbine. The key outcome is a light-weight and efficient method for managing requirements using the Neo4j graph database implementation.

TI  - Challenges of modeling and analysis in cybermanufacturing: a review from a machine learning and computation perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING
M3  - Review
AB  - In Industry 4.0, smart manufacturing is facing its next stage, cybermanufacturing, founded upon advanced communication, computation, and control infrastructure. Cybermanufacturing will unleash the potential of multi-modal manufacturing data, and provide a new perspective called computation service, as a part of service-oriented architecture (SOA), where on-demand computation requests throughout manufacturing operations are seamlessly satisfied by data analytics and machine learning. However, the complexity of information technology infrastructure leads to fundamental challenges in modeling and analysis under cybermanufacturing, ranging from information-poor datasets to a lack of reproducibility of analytical studies. Nevertheless, existing reviews have focused on the overall architecture of cybermanufacturing/SOA or its technical components (e.g., communication protocol), rather than the potential bottleneck of computation service with respect to modeling and analysis. In this paper, we review the fundamental challenges with respect to modeling and analysis in cybermanufacturing. Then, we introduce the existing efforts in computation pipeline recommendation, which aims at identifying an optimal sequence of method options for data analytics/machine learning without time-consuming trial-and-error. We envision computation pipeline recommendation as a promising research field to address the fundamental challenges in cybermanufacturing. We also expect that computation pipeline recommendation can be a driving force to flexible and resilient manufacturing operations in the post-COVID-19 industry.

TI  - A Safety-Aware, Systems-Based Approach to Teaching Software Testing
T2  - ITICSE'18: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD ANNUAL ACM CONFERENCE ON INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 23rd Annual ACM Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE)

AB  - Although no one doubts that ubiquitous software should be tested thoroughly, a dedicated course on software testing (ST) does not commonly feature in most CS curricula. Even when this is the case, existing courses often fail to offer a real-world testing experience, essential for a successful software engineering career. In our opinion, the main underlying reasons are twofold. First, abstracting software from its socio-technical system context, creates the false impression that ST "equals" unit testing based on functional requirements. Second, practicing on small, anonymously pre-engineered artifacts, conveys a detached and truncated view of the whole testing process. This paper describes an original approach to teach ST that addresses these two limitations by adopting a system engineering paradigm, with an additional strong emphasis on safety. Targeting CS graduates, the course consists of two modules. In the core module, students build fundamental testing knowledge in a software engineering context, and put this knowledge to work in both roles of developer and tester. In the project module, students get hands-on experience in engineering, and in particular testing, of microcontroller-based, safety-critical systems. Software risk and test experts from industry are actively involved in both modules, for advising, guest lectures and project steering. Enthusiastic students' evaluations throughout years demonstrate that cultivating safety- and hardware-awareness, although unusual for CS programs at nonengineering universities, creates a unique testing experience, while revealing remarkable technical and psychological trade-offs. All this brings more realism, and contributes to a meaningful and efficient learning in ST classrooms.

TI  - A Tutorial on Radio System-Level Simulations With Emphasis on 3GPP 5G-Advanced and Beyond
T2  - IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this tutorial we present recipes for dynamic system-level simulations (SLSs) of 5G and beyond cellular radio systems. A key ingredient for such SLSs is selection of proper models to make sure that the performance determining effects are properly reflected to ensure output of realistic radio performance results. We therefore present a significant number of SLS models and related methodologies for a variety of use cases. Our focus is on generally accepted models that are largely supported by academia and industrial players and adopted by 3GPP as being realistic. Among others, we touch on deployment models, traffic models, non-terrestrial cellular networks with satellites, SLS methodologies for Machine Learning (ML) enabled air-interface solutions, and many more. We also present several recommendations for best practices related to preparing and running detailed SLS campaigns, and agile software engineering considerations. Throughout the article we use the 3GPP defined 5G and 5G-Advanced systems to illustrate our points, extending it also into the 6G-era that is predicted to build on alike SLS methodologies and best practices.

T2  - ANNUAL RELIABILITY AND MAINTAINABILITY SYMPOSIUM - 2000 PROCEEDINGS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium
CL  - LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA
AB  - In this paper, enhancement of the performance of the Goel-Okumoto Reliability Growth model is investigated using various smoothing techniques. The method of parameter estimation for the model is the Maximum Likelihood Method. The evaluation of the performance of the model is judged by the relative error of the predicted number of failures over future time intervals relative to the number of failures eventually observed during the interval. The use of data analysis procedures utilizing the Laplace Trend test are investigated. These methods test for reliability growth throughout the data and establish "windows" that censor early failure data and provide better model fits. The research showed conclusively that the data analysis procedures resulted in improvement in the models' predictive performance for 41 different sets of software failure data collected from software development labs in the United States and Europe.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SENSYS)
CL  - Univ Calif, Berkeley, CA
AB  - Sensor networks have the potential to empower domain experts from a wide range of fields. However, presently they are notoriously difficult for these domain experts to program, even though their applications are often conceptually simple. We address this problem by applying the BASIC programming language to sensor networks and evaluating its effectiveness. BASIC has proven highly successful in the past in allowing novices to write useful programs on home computers. Our contributions include a user study evaluating how well novice (no programming experience) and intermediate (some programming experience) users can accomplish simple sensor network tasks in BASIC and in TinyScript (a principally event-driven high-level language for node-oriented programming) and an evaluation of power consumption issues in BASIC. 45-55% of novice users can complete simple tasks in BASIC, while only 0-17% can do so in TinyScript. In both languages, users generally are most successful using imperative loop-oriented programming. The use of an interpreter, such as our BASIC implementation, has little impact on the power consumption of applications in which computational demands are low. Further, when in final form, BASIC can be compiled to reduce power consumption even further.

T2  - SMART LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of distance education, lab and field work are a considerable challenge for students, professors, and institutions. This paper presents a Telepresence Robot Empowered Smart Lab (TRESL) system as a new and emerging technology with a potential to overcome this challenge. The main focus of this paper is to propose a conceptual model, to define the ultimate goals of the proposed solution, and to present its system architecture and the modules to support the functions and features. A pilot project was conducted and is also presented in this paper. The pilot project includes the experimental implementation of a telepresence robot in a mock-up smart lab and the collection and analysis of survey data from users of the robot. The main findings of the pilot study are, 1) online users can easily operate the telepresence robot; and 2) operating the robot manually will increase the engagement of online users with the remote lab environment. The pilot study provides firm evidence that the proposed TRESL system is a promising and innovative approach for online students to conduct their lab work in a remote laboratory. The results also suggest avenues for further research and development of the system.

TI  - Evaluating virtualization for fog monitoring of real-time applications in mixed-criticality systems
T2  - REAL-TIME SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Technological advances in embedded systems and the advent of fog computing led to improved quality of service of applications of cyber-physical systems. In fact, the deployment of such applications on powerful and heterogeneous embedded systems, such as multiprocessors system-on-chips (MPSoCs), allows them to meet latency requirements and real-time operation. Highly relevant to the industry and our reference case-study, the challenging field of nuclear fusion deploys the aforementioned applications, involving high-frequency control with hard real-time and safety constraints. The use of fog computing and MPSoCs is promising to achieve safety, low latency, and timeliness of such control. Indeed, on one hand, applications designed according to fog computing distribute computation across hierarchically organized and geographically distributed edge devices, enabling timely anomaly detection during high-frequency sampling of time series, and, on the other hand, MPSoCs allow leveraging fog computing and integrating monitoring by deploying tasks on a flexible platform suited for mixed-criticality software, leading to so-called mixed criticality systems (MCSs). However, the integration of such software on the same MPSoC opens challenges related to predictability and reliability guarantees, as tasks interfering with each other when accessing the same shared MPSoC resources may introduce non-deterministic latency, possibly leading to failures on account of deadline overruns. Addressing the design, deployment, and evaluation of MCSs on MPSoCs, we propose a model-based system development process that facilitates the integration of real-time and monitoring software on the same platform by means of a formal notation for modeling the design and deployment of MPSoCs. The proposed notation allows developers to leverage embedded hypervisors for monitoring real-time applications and guaranteeing predictability by isolation of hardware resources. Providing evidence of the feasibility of our system development process and evaluating the industry-relevant class of nuclear fusion applications, we experiment with a safety-critical case-study in the context of the ITER nuclear fusion reactor. Our experimentation involves the design and evaluation of several prototypes deployed as MCSs on a virtualized MPSoC, showing that deployment choices linked to the monitor placement and virtualization configurations (e.g., resource allocation, partitioning, and scheduling policies) can significantly impact the predictability of MCSs in terms of Worst-Case Execution Times and other related metrics.

AB  - With component-based systems becoming popular and handling diverse and critical applications, the need for their thorough evaluation has become very important. In this paper we propose an architecture-based unified hierarchical model for software performance, reliability, security and cache behavior prediction. We employ discrete time Markov chains (DTMCs) to model software systems and provide expressions for predicting the overall behavior of the system based on its architecture as well as the characteristics of individual components. This approach also facilitates the identification of various bottlenecks. We illustrate its use through some case studies and also provide expressions to perform sensitivity analysis.

TI  - NSF/ENG/ECCS-BSF: Collaborative Research: Foundations of secure multi-agent networked systems
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - The goal of this research project is to develop a new framework for the design of secure multi-agent systems along with the tools necessary for their analysis. The rapid pace of innovation in the areas of control theory, computation, and communication is leading the way for a new class of networked systems characterized by their complex interconnections, diversity of components, and interactions with the physical world. The potential benefits of these networked systems from environmental, economic, and social perspectives are however limited by the ability to secure them. There are currently many efforts under way to address the underlying security issues by ways of developing secure communication protocols and procedures. The PIs take a different point of view here: instead of developing methods to secure existing systems, they develop methods to design systems that are inherently secure and embedded with breach detection mechanisms. The PIs thus expand the secure-by-design philosophy popular in software engineering to the design of networked dynamical systems. In terms of applications, the proposed research program will significantly push forward the frontiers of secure design of cyber-physical systems, furthering their use across many domains including critical infrastructures such as transportation networks, power generation and distribution networks, water and gas distribution networks. The PIs will also contribute to educational outreach by developing new interactive modules, focusing on security issues of CPS for high school students, and mentoring graduate and undergraduate students.The proposed program is built upon three overarching principles: (i) control the information given to the agents, (ii) embed the agents with hidden security measures, and (iii) make the dynamics robust and resilient. More specifically, for the first principle, the PIs propose to establish a theoretical framework with novel design methodologies that can localize and encode both information and objectives for the agents. For the second principle, the PIs propose to embed the networked system with security measures that allow to detect easily tampering with large signals and its effect on the agents. These security measures can be certain functions that are designed to maintain invariant values over time and are locally computable by the agents. For the third principle, the PIs propose to leverage robust control theory for dealing with small attack injections, and moreover, introduce a novel controllability notion with provable guarantees on state attack recovery. In terms of intellectual merit, the proposed program will unify and exploit research in mathematics, namely integrating the study of symmetries in dynamical systems, completely integrable systems, and Hamiltonian dynamics, with engineering tools to develop methods to detect and foil attacks on a system. As such, it will establish new and deepen existing connections between mathematics, especially geometry and dynamical systems, and the study of cyber-physical systems.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

TI  - A Flexible and Modular Architecture for Edge Digital Twin: Implementation and Evaluation
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET OF THINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - IoT systems based on Digital Twins (DTs) - virtual copies of physical objects and systems - can be very effective to enable data-driven services and promote better control and decisions, in particular by exploiting distributed approaches where cloud and edge computing cooperate effectively. In this context, digital twins deployed on the edge represents a new strategic element to design a new wave of distributed cyber-physical applications. Existing approaches are generally focused on fragmented and domain-specific monolithic solutions and are mainly associated to model-driven, simulative or descriptive visions. The idea of extending the DTs role to support last-mile digitalization and interoperability through a set of general purpose and well-defined properties and capabilities is still underinvestigated. In this paper, we present the novel Edge Digital Twins (EDT) architectural model and its implementation, enabling the lightweight replication of physical devices providing an efficient digital abstraction layer to support the autonomous and standard collaboration of things and services. We model the core capabilities with respect to the recent definition of the state of the art, present the software architecture and a prototype implementation. Extensive experimental analysis shows the obtained performance in multiple IoT application contexts and compares them with that of state-of-the-art approaches.

CL  - Baltimore, MD
AB  - As air traffic in the United States has grown over the last several years, traffic demand has begun to outstrip capacity. As of 2005, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had no effective approach for strategically managing a weather event that has been very disruptive to the national aviation system-large-scale thunderstorms that block the major flight routes in the northeastern United States. The operations research team that supports the FAA's efforts to provide innovations in air traffic management, led by researchers at Metron Aviation, Inc. and the Volpe Transportation Center, recognized the consequence of this operational deficiency and set out to resolve it. In this paper, we show how this team(1) developed and applied system-simulation models to quantify the extent of the traffic flow management problem and convey its magnitude to the FAA and to the aviation industry;(2) designed the Airspace Flow Program (AFP), a new approach to managing air traffic that could correct the problem within the limitations of a short development cycle and a change-resistant culture;(3) designed and developed an interactive simulation system that could be and was used to re. ne and perfect this concept prior to deployment by developing policies on the use of a decision support system;(4) engaged FAA and airline traffic management experts in a series of interactive exercises using the simulation system to develop the final software design, operational procedures, and decision rules for deployment and use; and(5) provided a clear and convincing postdeployment benefits assessment for the new traffic management approach.The deployment of this new capability was an enormous success that both the FAA and the airline community heralded widely. The postdeployment impact assessment showed benefits to the aircraft operators and the flying public of almost $190 million in 2006 and 2007, the first two years of use, compared to less than $5 million in design and development costs. Broader usage of AFPs and new applications for them show a projected 10-year benefit of approximately $2.8 billion.

TI  - Infrastructure and the cognitive ecosystem: an irrevocable transformation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH: INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Disruption of legacy infrastructure systems by novel digital and connected technologies represents not simply the rise of cyberphysical systems as hybrid physical and digital assets but, ultimately, the integration of legacy systems into a new cognitive ecosystem. This cognitive ecosystem, an ecology of massive data flows, artificial intelligence, institutional and intellectual structures, and connected technologies, is poised to alter how humans and artificial intelligence understand and control our world. Infrastructure managers need to be ready for this paradigm shift, recognizing their systems are increasingly being absorbed into an emerging suite of data, analytical tools, and decisionmaking technologies that will fundamentally restructure how legacy systems behave and are controlled, how decisions are made, and most importantly how workers interact with the systems. Infrastructure managers must restructure their organizations and engage in cross-organizational sensemaking if they are to be capable of navigating the complexity of the cognitive ecosystem. The cognitive ecosystem is fundamentally poised to change what infrastructures are, necessitating the need for managers to take a close look at the functions and actions of their own systems. The continuing evolution of the Anthropocene and the cognitive ecosystem has profound implications for infrastructure education. A sustained commitment to change is necessary that restructures and reorients infrastructure organizations within the cognitive ecosystem, where knowledge is generated, and control of services is wielded by myriad stakeholders.

TI  - Randomized algorithms for nonlinear system identification with deep learning modification
T2  - INFORMATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Both randomized algorithms and deep learning techniques have been successfully used for regression and classification problems. However, the random hidden weights of the randomized algorithms require suitable distributions in advance, and the deep learning methods do not use the output information in system identification.In this paper, the distributions of the hidden weights are obtained by the restricted Boltzmann machines. This deep learning method uses, input data to construct the statistical features of the hidden weights. The output weights of the neural model are trained by normal randomized algorithms. So we successfully combine the unsupervised training (deep learning) and the supervised learning method (randomized algorithm), and take advantages from both of them. The proposed randomized algorithms with deep learning modification are validated with three benchmark problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Automating Verification and Validation Processes Through Model Based Systems Engineering
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - This research aims to develop a systematic methodology for Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) driven qualitative and quantitative system verification. MBSE refers to formalised methodology for supporting requirement engineering, system design, analysis and verification and validation through leveraging system models described in languages such as the OMG SysML. SysML is one of system modelling languages that can be used to develop a system architecture making majority of parametric and behavioural specifications of a System Architecture Model (SAM) simulatable and executable. This allows for carrying out trade studies, model-based testing and model checking, automated generation of system interfaces, test cases and other artifacts important for the system verification and validation.   Madni and Sievers, 2018 highlight the role of MBSE in reducing the development time and error rates through eliminating design flaws and evaluating design and implementation suitability at early development stages and whether the system can meet stakeholder needs and requirements as discussed by Bachelor et al 2020. Model-based Verification and Validation (V&V) can therefore mitigate several shortcomings of a more traditional document-based systems engineering process.   The objectives to deliver this research project are:   1. To review current state-of-the-art MBSE and V&V practices used across different industries as well as at AVL to understand both industry (automotive) wide and AVL's specific requirements 2. To develop a systematic approach for a product-description driven system model quality assessment to understand the model's maturity, completeness, and correctness and to identify available artefacts for verification and validation activities  3. To develop a systematic approach for model-based testing including test case generation, export and execution based on the model description and quality gateways  4. To assess the role of a human in the developed automated V&V process to abstract complexity and increase workflow efficiency for end users  5. To identify system and process boundaries of the new methodology developed in obj. 2 - obj. 4 to propose deployment strategy in the organisation for integration of the new methodology within existing toolchain infrastructure   The increased adoption of digital-modelling environments has resulted in the increase of adoption of MBSE as means of managing the system complexity of cyber-physical systems. Its promised benefits have however been predominantly explored in academic and research environments and its real-world application is still behind due to its rigorous and labour-intensive nature.  The project's potential impacts and applications are therefore identified as follows:   Exploit the benefits of an MBSE approach within the constraints of an industrial, real-world environment  Provide systematic model assessment approach with respect to completeness, correctness and maturity Frontload V&V activities through MBSE to eliminate issues in early stages of development  Provide guideline on managing the complexity and traceability of the development and verification of cyber-physical systems thus improving time to market  This research is relevant to the UKRI EPSRC's Manufacturing the Future and Engineering Themes as it focuses on applying MBSE to enhance V&V activities potentially resulting in increased product quality, reduced development costs and enhanced traceability for product lifecycle assessment.

TI  - Reactivation of a trap-boundary fault and its impacts on hydrocarbon migration and accumulation in Longkou 7-6 structure, Bohai Bay Basin: insights from geology, geophysics and basin modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The growth of trap-boundary faults and changes in fault sealing capacity during activation may significantly affect the evolution of hydrocarbon migration and accumulation. Previous studies have often overlooked the interaction between changes in sealing capacity and the dynamic processes of hydrocarbon migration and accumulation during fault growth/activation. This study focuses on the trap-boundary fault within the Longkou 7 - 6 (LK7-6) structure, an ideal site for examining the impact of fault activity on hydrocarbon migration and accumulation. Seismic and borehole data were used to quantitatively investigate the history of fault growth and activation, as well as changes in fault-sealing capacity during reactivation. This was achieved by calculating fault throw and shale gouge ratio (SGR). Additionally, basin and petroleum system modeling (BPSM) was employed to reconstruct the dynamic evolution of hydrocarbon migration and accumulation during reactivation. The geological and geophysical studies indicate that the trap-boundary fault consists of at least three segments connected through lateral propagation. The fault experienced growth during the Paleogene, followed by a decrease in activity, and later entered a phase of neotectonic reactivation around 5.1 Ma. This reactivation of the trap-boundary fault played a dual role in hydrocarbon migration and accumulation, providing vertical pathways for migration while also causing vertical leakage. The dynamic evaluation of fault sealing capacity demonstrates that fault reactivation could alter lithological juxtapositions, thereby compromising fault seal integrity and facilitating cross-fault hydrocarbon leakage. The study enhances the understanding of the interaction between fault dynamic evaluation and hydrocarbon migration and accumulation, particularly through the integration of fault activity history and fault-sealing capacity evaluation with basin and petroleum system modeling (BPSM). This approach offers new insights into exploration strategies for fault-bound traps, representing a significant advancement over traditional static analysis.

AB  - Blended learning is a modern trend in education. It enables the formation of synergies between traditional educational communications, electronic information dialogues and appeals to electronic resources. System algorithms of blended learning allow to use the method of "small steps" and to create a composition of interrelated educational processes. The purpose of the study is to identify key processes, roles of learners, learning situations and outcomes. A number of scientific and practical knowledge of authors and their practical experience are the base of this research and the introduction of its results into a practical educational process. Among them are the implementation of the method of "inverted class", the active involvement of specialists and the formation of simulation model of practical activity students for future. The peculiarities of self-development in the direction of the management education platform and the teaching experience of the authors are the basis for making changes in the well-known approaches in blended learning of IT education. The purpose of the study is to identify key educational processes, to find algorithms of using internal and external electronic resources. The introduction of the proposed algorithms is tested during the teaching of disciplines "Algorithms and Data Structures", "Fundamentals of Software Engineering", "Project Management", "Computer Networks" etc. The main changes in educational processes are: using of special network simulation software and project management software; using new approaches tests construction and encouraging students their mastering; the students' individual and teamwork in an education management system environment. The results of the research consist of determining role-based behavioural educational processes in management of education systems. The new opportunities for dynamics of improving of educational resources is based on involving practitioners, the using of open distance courses and the using of new forms of work with students. The question of activating the role of employers in the educational process and involving them in the evaluation of students' work, as well as the introduction of real cases, is an important issue.

TI  - Evaluating the Cost of Prevention Programming and Universal Screening with Discrete Event Simulation
T2  - ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY IN MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a novel system modeling technique that allows for the evaluation of the potential costs and personnel needed for mental health services in school. A case study is presented to illustrate how DES could be used by a school's decision makers to help plan for implementation of an integrated mental health service model. Discrete Event Simulation was used to model the personnel, time, and costs of an integrated mental health service model within a school setting. In addition, costs are calculated and then compared to a business as usual model. Data from the present investigation indicate substantial cost savings of implementing a prevention oriented mental health intervention model within a school setting. In a school of 1000 students, the prevention model could result in an annual cost savings of approximately $30,000 as well as a 50% reduction in disciplinary referrals and 22% reduction in suspensions. Results from the present investigation indicate substantial savings in financial resources and overall numbers of disciplinary infractions when implementing a prevention model. The DES allows for customization of personnel and time to modify the model and resulting output to local conditions. These data may allow school administrators to modify resources to meet student needs. In addition, cost data can help address some of the common implementation barriers associated with adoption of universal screening and preventative mental health services.

TI  - Addressing Technical Challenges in Large Language Model-Driven Educational Software System
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational systems poses significant challenges across several key attributes, including integration, explainability, testability, and scalability. These challenges arise from the complexity of coordinating system components, difficulty interpreting LLM decision-making processes, and the need for reliable, consistent model outputs in varied educational scenarios. Additionally, ensuring scalability requires robust autoscaling mechanisms and suitable architecture design to handle fluctuating workloads. This paper tackles these challenges by proposing tactics to improve system integration, enhance explainability through metadata and an algorithm process, ensure response consistency via regression testing, and facilitate efficient autoscaling through an event-driven microservice architecture. The evaluation results highlight the effectiveness of these tactics, confirming both functional consistency and robust system performance under varying loads.

TI  - Infusing sustainability into software engineering education: Lessons learned from capstone projects
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable development (SD) has become a millennium challenge for humanity. It has boosted the integration of sustainable, sound practices across different fields (e.g. e-participation, smart transportation, sustainable agriculture). Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have strongly supported social transitions in becoming more sustainable and participative over the last two decades. Integrating multi-disciplinary sustainability concepts into the higher education of computer scientists is important in that this ensures that future ICT endeavours will take sustainability concerns into account. This article describes four capstone projects developed by students from the Erasmus Mundus Master Course in Pervasive Computing and Communications for Sustainable Development (PERCCOM), who were enrolled alongside regular students in a traditional software engineering course held at the Lap-peenranta University of Technology. The coursework was part of a research project called Green.Citizen@ICT, which aims at investigating the use of ICT and software services for infusing sustainable habits in citizens through the development of applications for SD. This study demonstrates how a sustainable development focus can be integrated into a traditional software engineering course. The goal of this article is to enhance understanding of the integration of sustainability into software engineering education, by providing a detailed example of a master course in which this took place. This course supported the development of ICT competences for building cleaner, greener, and more resource- and energy-efficient cyber-physical systems, while addressing the social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.

TI  - A low-code assessment platform for urban digital twins
T2  - INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Digital twins, as virtual models reflecting physical entities, serve multiple purposes, supporting the understanding, design, and management of systems, across various domains. The concept of digital twins has been also applied to smart cities, coining the term "Urban Digital Twin". Indeed, smart cities continuously produce data that can serve as a real-time feed for their digital twin representations. However, developing urban digital twins is challenging as the domain is complex and evolving rapidly. Moreover, existing digital twin platforms are mostly generic platforms, limiting their adoption for a specific context such as smart cities. Objectives: The aim of this study is to overcome the limitation of existing general-purpose digital twin platforms, particularly in the context of smart cities, by supporting the development and evolution of urban digital twins. Method: To this aim, we propose a low-code assessment platform for smart cities represented as urban digital twins by leveraging distributed runtime models to implement and deploy service-based quality evaluation systems. The innovative platform and its architecture enable the creation of efficient urban digital twins, allowing for their continuous evolution without requiring redeployment whenever the digital twin definitions are modified. Results: Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed platform, highlighting its potential for evolving urban digital twins in smart cities quality assessment. Conclusions: Results show evidence that combining distributed runtime models with the advantages of low-code platforms is beneficial within the smart cities domain. Moreover, this study underscores the significance of specialized platforms tailored to the smart cities domain.

TI  - BOND GRAPHS - THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR EDUCATING STUDENTS IN MODELING CONTINUOUS-TIME PHYSICAL SYSTEMS
T2  - SIMULATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a modeling technique that, better than alternative approaches, teaches the student to develop from the start valid models of physical continuous-time processes. Several examples of state-space models are presented that look very plausible, give seemingly plausible results, and yet are physically wrong. These examples may serve to illustrate the potential dangers behind state-space descriptions used as a modeling tool. It is our conviction that model validation should be integrated with model building, and should not be an afterthought. The band graph modeling technique enables us to describe physical systems in terms that are much closer to physical reality than state-space modeling. Thereby many of the standard pitfalls in making models are avoided right from the beginning. Bad (i.e., non-physical) models have no chance of being created in the first place.

TI  - PETRI NETS FOR MODELING OF DYNAMIC-SYSTEMS - A SURVEY
T2  - AUTOMATICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Petri nets enable a discrete event system of any kind whatsoever to be modeled. They present two interesting characteristics. Firstly they make it possible to model and visualize behaviors comprising concurrency, synchronization and resource sharing. Secondly the theoretical results concerning them are plentiful. The aim of this paper is to present the basic concept relative to Petri nets and the various classes of derived models   which can be used for dynamic system modeling. The tool enables qualitative and quantitative analysis and its numerous applications have been still further increased by a number of research workers to enable more condensed descriptions, even where the time factor intervenes, such as synchronized, timed, stochastic, colored and continuous models. Each of these models thus has its own specific character and privileged fields of application. Nevertheless, the ordinary Petri net forms a common basis: it may be likened to a 'common language' allowing dialogue between persons of very varied training backgrounds.

TI  - Effective Estimation of Modules' Metrics in Software Defect Prediction
T2  - WORLD CONGRESS ON ENGINEERING 2009, VOLS I AND II
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - World Congress on Engineering 2009
CL  - Imperial Coll London, London, ENGLAND
AB  - The prediction of software defects has recently attracted the attention of software quality researchers. Many predictive classification systems have already been proposed, which aim at early discovery of software modules that are fault-prone and versa. The proposed methods are usually assessed using datasets available from NASA Metrics Data repository. These datasets include a combination of design-level and code-level metrics for different modules. To apply a defect predictor, all metrics have to be measured for any of the modules (to be used as the classifier inputs). The measurement of some of these metrics is easy and can be done straight forward. However, there are a number of metrics which are more difficult or time-consuming to quantify. Moreover, many of them do not have an exact value; so, they may get different values when using different formulas or tools. In this paper, we first discuss this hypothesis that some strong dependencies exist among various features of these datasets. Based on this hypothesis, we search for short combinations of features from the first category (easy-to-measure features), which can describe any of the features from the second category (hard-to-measure features) with a high accuracy. Then, we introduce a set of fuzzy modeling systems, each of which estimates the value of one of the second category features from its specified determinants. The evaluation of the estimation systems is carried out by computing the MSE values for all features. The experimental results are promising. The presented estimation system provides usability of the defect prediction system rather than its accuracy. Using this system, the user will not have to measure all the required mentioned metrics for any of the modules. All the features of the second category will automatically be estimated with a high accuracy.

TI  - Situation awareness modeling and pilot state estimation for tactical cockpit interfaces
T2  - DESIGN OF COMPUTING SYSTEMS: SOCIAL AND ERGONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI International 97)
CL  - SAN FRANCISCO, CA
AB  - This paper desribes a study that assessed the feasibility of developing an adaptive pilot/vehicle interface (PVI) prototype that uses measures of pilot workload and computational situation assessment models to drive the content, format, and modality of military cockpit displays. The system architecture consists of three distinct modules. 1) an on-line situation assessor that generates a "picture" of the tactical situation; 2) a pilot state estimator module that uses physiological signals and other measures to estimate pilot workload; and 3) a PVI adaptation module, which uses the assessed situation to determine the pilot's information requirements, and the pilot state estimate to determine the most appropriate modality and format for conveying that information. The prototype display is being integrated with the Synthetic Immersion Research Environments (SIRE) simulator at the Armstrong Laboratory of Wright Patterson Air Force Base.

AB  - Conventional fuzzy system design involves finding optimal numbers, shapes and fine tuning of membership functions in the input and output universes of discourse. One way to circumvent a trial-and-error approach is to use expert knowledge. When expert knowledge is not available or is insufficient, this drawback can be overcome by combining the advantages of neural networks which have well. established supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms available, and fuzzy systems.In this paper an approximate simplified fuzzy reasoning method is introduced. This method can automatically determine the optimal number and locations of pseudo antecedent and consequent rules on input and output universes of discourse for a given data driven fuzzy system. A self-learning algorithm for this proposed neuro-fuzzy architecture is developed and its applications to several dynamic system identification problems are presented.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we investigate the use of the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for system modelling. A new sigmoidal activation function is introduced and the study is focused at the utilization of this function on a MLP that performs modelling of dynamic, discrete time systems. The role of the activation function in the training process is investigated analytically, and it is proven that the shape of the activation function and it's derivative can affect the training outcome. The method is simulated at a well known benchmark, namely the three tank system, and is incorporated in a Fault Detection and Identification (FDI) method, also applied and simulated at the three tank system. Finally, a comparison is made with an approach that utilizes local model neural networks for system modeling.

TI  - A fuzzy-neural network method for modeling uncertainties in soil-structure interaction problems
T2  - COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainty often recurs in structural system characterization as well as in choosing the mechanical model and in calibrating it. When analyzing a structure founded in cohesionless soils, the uncertainty in system modeling comes from soil inherent variability, site conditions, construction tolerance, and failure mechanisms. In this research, a Fuzzy-Neural Network method to predict the behavior of structures built on complex cohesionless soils is proposed. The method is based on an Artificial-Neural Network (ANN) for modeling the soil-foundation interaction. Its learning process analyzes over 200 records of building foundations, tanks, and embankments settlements on sand and gravel. Once validated, ANN is introduced in the soil-foundation-sovrastructure interaction model. Using fuzzy sets to define vague and ambiguous variables, the Fuzzy-Neural Network method predicts the system behavior and quantifies the uncertainty of its response. A numerical example shows the method effectiveness in the case of uncertainty in soil parameters and gives suggestions for successive applications.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, an active seat suspension system that is robust to uncertainties and unknown road profiles is designed using a state and disturbance observer. The controller which needs the measurement of just the seat frame position is analyzed with a 4-degree-of-freedom biodynamic model of the passenger for performance and stability. The proposed scheme is validated by simulation for a variety of road profiles under various uncertainties and compared with passive suspension, linear quadratic regulator-based active seat suspension, and conventional active cabin suspension using the evaluation norms set by ISO-2631. The proposed scheme is seen to be robust to uncertainties in seat frame suspension, passenger mass, and cabin suspension.

TI  - Infrastructure and Tools for Testing the Vulnerability of Control Systems to Cyberattacks: A Coal Mine Industrial Facility Case
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Testing the vulnerability of information systems to cyberattacks is essential to ensure the operational security of organizations and industrial processes. In particular, it is essential to ensure the resilience of industrial processes, as a possible cyberattack can lead to process malfunctions and even process shutdowns, which can lead to substantial economic losses. The possibility of various attacks, e.g., ransomware, phishing, or advanced persistent threats (APTs), requires the evaluation of the effectiveness of cyberattack detection and incident response mechanisms. In industry, it is often impossible to carry out this type of test without risking system disruption, making it difficult to assess the true effectiveness of security features. This article discusses the issues concerned with testing the cyber resilience of a system operating in a real coal mine. First, this work briefly presents the hardware and software architecture used in the coal mine. Secondly, it describes the problem of replicating a real system in the laboratory and the necessary tools and methods used to implement a resilient system architecture. Finally, the scenarios of cyberattacks are detailed, and the obtained results are discussed.

TI  - Reliability estimation based on system data with an unknown load share rule
T2  - LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - We consider a multicomponent load-sharing system in which the failure rate of a given component depends on the set of working components at any given time. Such systems can arise in software reliability models and in multivariate failure-time models in biostatistics, for example. A load-share rule dictates how stress or load is redistributed to the surviving components after a component fails within the system. In this paper, we assume the load share rule is unknown and derive methods for statistical inference on load-share parameters based on maximum likelihood. Components with ( individual) constant failure rates are observed in two environments: ( 1) the system load is distributed evenly among the working components, and ( 2) we assume only the load for each working component increases when other components in the system fail. Tests for these special load-share models are investigated.

AB  - The development of river basin policy and management plans involves a spectrum of concerned parties and organizations, only a small fraction of which are presented by technical professionals. Easily-used and highly-interactive computer simulations provide one means by which these individuals can develop a conceptual and intuitive understanding for the complex physical behavior of river systems. NileSim is a Windows-based simulator of the complete Nile River basin. NileSim was developed principally for the educational purpose of explaining complex river behavior and management to nontechnical people. The simulator has been developed in a cost-effective manner, making use of modem software development tools from electronic design automation. This has provided an accurate tool that is fast, graphically intuitive, and simple to use. The tool supports interactive experimentation with a simulated Nile River basin for users to learn by observation how that basin system works.

TI  - Search-based product line fault detection allocating test cases iteratively
T2  - 21ST INTERNATIONAL SYSTEMS & SOFTWARE PRODUCT LINE CONFERENCE (SPLC 2017), VOL 1
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 21st International System and Software Product Line Conference (SPLC)
CL  - Sevilla, SPAIN
AB  - The large number of possible configurations makes it unfeasible to test every single system variant in a product line. Consequently, a small subset of the product line products must be selected, typically following combinatorial interaction testing approaches. Recently, many product line engineering approaches have considered the selection and prioritization of relevant products within the product line. In a further step, these products are thoroughly tested individually. However, the test cases that must be executed in each of the products are not always insignificant, and in systems such as Cyber-Physical System Product Lines (CPSPLs), their test execution time can vary from tens to thousands of seconds. This issue leads to spending a lot of time testing each individual product. To solve this problem we propose a search-based approach to perform the testing of product lines by allocating small number of test cases in each of the products. This approach increases the probability of detecting faults faster. Specifically, our search-based approach obtains a set of products, which are derived from using any state-of-the-art approach as inputs, and a set of a attributed test cases. As an output a list of allocated test cases for each product is obtained. We also define a novel fitness function to guide the search and we propose corresponding crossover and mutation operators. The search and test process is iteratively repeated until the time budget is consumed. We performed an evaluation with a CPSPL as a case study. Results suggest that our approach can reduce the fault detection time by 61% and 65% on average when compared with the traditional test process and the Random Search algorithm respectively.

TI  - Extracting fuzzy rules for system modeling using a hybrid of genetic algorithms and Kalman filter
T2  - FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a hybrid algorithm for extracting important fuzzy rules from a given rule base to construct a "parsimonious'' fuzzy model with a high generalization ability. This algorithm combines the advantages of genetic algorithms' strong search capacity and Kalman filter's fast convergence merit. Each random combination of the rules in the rule base is coded into a binary string and treated as a chromosome in genetic algorithms. The binary string indicates the structure of a fuzzy model. The parameters of the model are then estimated using the Kalman filter. In order to achieve a trade-off between the accuracy and the complexity of a fuzzy model, the Schwarz-Rissanen Criterion is used as an evaluation function in the hybrid algorithm. The practical applicability of the proposed algorithm is examined by computer simulations on a human operator modeling problem and a nonlinear system modeling problem. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B,V.

AB  - This article elaborates the iterative learning mechanism for time-varying system identification, and describes the learning algorithms that could achieve the consistent estimation for time-varying parameters under persistent repetitive-excitation conditions. A dynamic parametrization approach, in this article, is presented for modeling and analysis a general class of nonlinear systems. The derivations are conducted to give linear-in-the-parameters models with time-varying coefficients. The resultant models can be in a unified form, with the aid of the variable difference representation, and the iterative learning least squares algorithm and its variant are applicable for the purpose of parameter estimation. Moreover, a learning control scheme is adopted for demonstrating effectiveness of the dynamically-parametrized modes, which are simulated and fully compared with the presented numerical results.

TI  - Proactive Security for Safety and Sustainability of Mission Critical Systems
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ensuring cyber network security becomes a challenging step with the increase of cyber attacks. The latter are targeting any cyber system starting from personal computers to national critical infrastructures. Consequently, the development of a proactive cyber defense technique to detect and react to cyber attacks before the damage occurrence becomes a necessity. To this end, we develop in this work a formal model to proactively ensure safety and sustainability of mission critical systems. Our proposal consists of deploying a network of observer agents to supervise and generate observation data related to attacks under execution which will be analyzed by a central defense agent. The latter will hypothetically generate a graph of potential scenarios that could be executed in the network. A scenario context will be introduced to compute a set of probabilistic measures for the proactive assessment of attack damages. Another graph decomposing the cyber network global mission into sub operations, and presenting the cyber assets ensuring mission achievement, will be presented. Such a graph will be used to study the cyber attack impact on mission accomplishment and, thus, will ensure the system sustainability by proactively reacting to cyber attacks. A case study is provided to illustrate the proposal.

TI  - CPS: Small: Reconciling Safety with the Internet for Cyber-Physical Systems
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Internet technology, originally developed to convey information, is increasingly being used to control and operate physical devices in homes, factories, medical facilities, and transportation systems, to name just a few application domains. In these more physically-grounded applications, the consequences of misbehavior of a system can be dire, involving not just loss or leakage of information, but loss of life. Historically, computers used in safety-critical systems have been completely isolated from the Internet to protect them from malicious hackers and unpredictable demands for their resources. But the benefits that Internet connectivity offers are irresistible, enabling far more sophisticated services. This project is developing a suite of mathematically-grounded design patterns and open-source software that leverages Internet technology while guaranteeing safety, reliability, and resilience to malicious attacks. One of these patterns endows a networked system with a stronger coordinated notion of time to ensure consistent behavior of the system even in face of unpredictable and uncontrollable delays in the network. Another of these patterns leverages edge computing, placement of computing services near the devices that use them, in hospitals, onboard in cars and trains, and in factories, for example, to mitigate the risks of relying on remote cloud-based services. Edge computers can ensure continuous safe operation even in face of Internet infrastructure collapse, as has occasionally happened under malicious attack.Technical Description:The Internet of Things (IoT) leverages Internet technology in cyber-physical  systems, but the protocols and principles of the Internet were not designed for interacting with the physical world. For example, timeliness is not a factor in any widespread Internet technology, with Quality-of-Service (QoS) features having been routinely omitted for decades. Nevertheless, properties of the Internet could prove valuable in CPS, including a global namespace, reliable (eventual) delivery of messages, end-to-end security through asymmetric encryption, certificate-based authentication, and the ability to aggregate data from a multiplicity of sources in cloud-based warehouses. This proposal leverages recent developments that hold promise to bridge the gap, enabling the use of Internet technologies even in safety-critical, timing-sensitive applications such as factory automation and transportation. Specifically, we leverage time-sensitive network (TSN) technology; the use of smart gateways to isolate safety-critical services from best-effort services and to provide local proxies for cloud-based services; locally centralized, globally distributed authentication and authorization; and the development of coherent time-based semantics for distributed real-time services. The focus of this project will be on sound concurrent models of computation, on type-theoretic methods for ensuring correct composition, and on the realization of these formalisms in a software architecture that reconciles widely-used mechanisms in Internet services to hide uncontrollable latencies with the need for repeatable, testable, and robust real-time services in safety-critical systems. An open-source reference implementation will be delivered together with analytical papers on the formal properties of the models.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

AB  - Considering that the economic indicators have a great impact on electricity consumption, social sensors are used to capture massive social signals and intelligent sensors are used to collect electricity data based on the cyber-physical-social system(CPSS) theoretical framework. In this paper, an economic-power cyber-physical-social system is built to integrate the data from different spaces. In cyberspace, the data will be fused, normalized before training, then a deep belief network(DBN) model is established to perform data mining and realize mid-long term electricity consumption forecasting. In the DBN training process, economic-power data from 31 provinces are used. DBN can achieve feature extraction automatically without variable selection steps and can achieve higher forecasting accuracy than traditional methods. The application of CPSS in electricity consumption forecasting has expanded the data border of physical power system researches and can provide a reference for subsequent multi-space data modeling.

AB  - CPS is kinds of networked embedded systems that combine calculating system and physical environment. Because software is the main component of CPS, its energy consumption will directly affect the trustworthiness of CPS. Software architecture can provide design model and guidance for constructing software structure, behavior and key attributes in design phase. So modeling, analyzing and evaluating the software architecture energy consumption of the CPS software can help find the energy consumption design defects, which will effectively reduce the cost and improve development efficiency. Time state transition matrix (TSTM), designed for modeling embedded software behavior, is a table-based state machine modeling language with time semantic in which the front-end is expressed in the table form and the back-end has strict formalized definition. By introducing energy consumption indicators and constraints for TSTM, form energy consumption TSTM (ETSTM), make it be suitable to the software architecture modeling of energy consumption. On this basis, the energy consumption analysis method with multiple attributes restriction based on bounded model checking technology (BMC) is provided. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by modeling and verifying certain type train control software.

TI  - Scalability testing automation using multivariate characterization and detection of software performance antipatterns
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Software Performance Antipatterns (SPAs) research has focused on algorithms for their characterization, detection, and solution. Existing algorithms are based on the analysis of runtime behavior to detect trends on several monitored variables, such as system response time and CPU utilization. However, the lack of computationally efficient methods currently limits their integration into modern agile practices to detect SPAs in large scale systems.Objective: In this paper, we extended our previously proposed approach for the automated SPA characterization and detection designed to support continuous integration/delivery/deployment (CI/CDD) pipelines, with the goal of addressing the lack of computationally efficient algorithms.Method: We introduce a machine learning-based approach to improve the detection of SPA and interpretation of approach's results. The approach is complemented with a simulation-based methodology to analyze different architectural alternatives and measure the precision and recall of our approach. Our approach includes SPA statistical characterization using a multivariate analysis of load testing experimental results to identify the services that have the largest impact on system scalability.Results: To show the effectiveness of our approach, we have applied it to a large complex telecom system at Ericsson. We have built a simulation model of the Ericsson system and we have evaluated the introduced methodology by using simulation-based SPA injection. For this system, we are able to automatically identify the top five services that represent scalability choke points. We applied two machine learning algorithms for the automated detection of SPA.Conclusion: We contributed to the state-of-the-art by introducing a novel approach to support computationally efficient SPA characterization and detection that has been applied to a large complex system using performance testing data. We have compared the computational efficiency of the proposed approach with state-of-the-art heuristics. We have found that the approach introduced in this paper grows linearly, which is a significant improvement over existing techniques. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper validates the integrated modeling methodology used for design and performance evaluation of complex opto-mechanical systems, particularly spaceborne interferometers. The methodology integrates structural modeling, optical modeling, and control system modeling and design into a common environment, the Integrated Modeling of Optical Systems (IMOS) software package. The validation uses the Micro-Precision Interferometer (MPI) testbed, a ground-based, full-scale hardware model df a spaceborne interferometer. Parallel development of the MPI testbed and an MPI integrated model enabled a unique opportunity to validate the modeling methodology with actual testbed measurements. This paper assesses the ability of the integrated modeling methodology to predict performance in a closed-loop configuration, namely with high-bandwidth optical control loops operational. The assessment is a comparison of integrated model closed-loop predictions with MPI testbed closed-loop measurements, indicating that the integrated modeling methodology is accurate to within a factor of three.

TI  - Model identification of a micro air vehicle in loitering flight based on attitude performance evaluation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a model identification of a micro air vehicle in loitering flight, based on the input-output data collected from flight experiments on a homemade 1-m-sized aircraft. A miniature flight-control system, which consists of the onboard and the ground sections, is equipped with a multichannel data logger associated with the data acquisition software. Modeling and performance analysis are carried out, based on the flight-test data using a system identification technique. Two fourth-order autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) models are identified to present the attitude characteristics of the longitudinal (pitch) and the lateral (roll) control channels, respectively. The validity of the identified model is verified by both time-domain model prediction and frequency-domain spectral analysis. Based on the proposed ARX models, two compensators are further designed using a frequency-domain method, and then added to the closed-loop control systems to improve the transient performance of the pitch- and roll-control channels. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that the flight performance obtained by the proposed ARX model-based compensation control can be improved.

AB  - This paper presents a new modification of the method for process transfer function identification (TFI) and two new power unit dynamic models based on this method. The basic method uses a two-stage procedure where the first stage is the frequency response identification of a process, while the second one is the transfer function computation using frequency response obtained in the first stage. The power unit models, which are identified using one relatively simple experiment are applied to load-frequency control. These dynamic models developed for the vicinity of the steady-state operation mode can be used for Automatic Generation Control purposes, to tune load-frequency control systems, as well as to build and set up a real-time simulator for dispatcher training. The modeling of 575MW power units of the IEC (Israel) is fulfilled through implementation of these models and by their identification method yielding sufficiently good results.

AB  - Education in the information security domain increasingly integrates practical hands-on training; where exercises focusing on secure cyber operations and secure software development are used for training the participants in designing and building secure systems. These exercises utilize multiple approaches in their context, such as capture the flag, attack/defense, reverse engineering, and incident response, while they are conducted on specifically created testbeds that by design integrate vulnerabilities to support the training scenarios. However, these exercises represent only the perspective of the attacker and/or the defender, without reflecting the perspective of the designer, while they statistically have primary focus on network security. In this article, we argue that the best way to understand the consequences of insecure design and development is to combine engineering and exploitation activities in one exercise, proposing the use of "Make it and break it" type of exercises for security training in cyber physical systems. Accordingly, we conducted a case study for validation and verification, the results of which are presented in this article. The case study was performed over the period of two days, during the training boot camp of the Norwegian national team for the European cyber security challenge 2018. During the boot camp, the team has been separated into two groups, which were challenged to design and build an IoT (Internet of Things) smart home using secure design principles, and then attack each other in order to identify security weaknesses. Pre and post-exercise surveys have been conducted, and the feedback from the participants was used in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the exercise, as a pilot towards further development and optimization.

TI  - Role of Disease Progression Models in Drug Development
T2  - PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of Disease progression models (DPMs) in Drug Development has been widely adopted across therapeutic areas as a method for integrating previously obtained disease knowledge to elucidate the impact of novel therapeutics or vaccines on disease course, thus quantifying the potential clinical benefit at different stages of drug development programs. This paper provides a brief overview of DPMs and the evolution in data types, analytic methods, and applications that have occurred in their use by Quantitive Clinical Pharmacologists. It also provides examples of how these models have informed decisions and clinical trial design across several therapeutic areas and at various stages of development. It briefly describes potential new applications of DPMs utilizing emerging data sources, and utilizing new analytic techniques, and discuss new challenges faced such as requiring description of multiple endpoints, rapid model development, application of machine learning-based analytics, and use of high dimensional and real-world data. Considerations for the continued evolution future of DPMs to serve as community-maintained expert systems are also provided.

TI  - PROGRESS: the sectoral approach to cyber resilience
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Each critical infrastructure and vital service represents a unique instance of a complex socio-technical-economic system. Resilience in complex systems is an emergent behaviour that occurs from interactions between components and is not easily predictable from understanding each component in isolation. Yet, cybersecurity practice and maturity models still focus on the robustness of separate components: organizational units, firms, or IT applications. Such a fundamental mismatch between theory and tools is among the causes of pervasive cyber insecurity. We introduce the sectoral capability maturity model to enable a comprehensive improvement of systemic resilience. The promoting global cyber resilience for sectors cyber-capability maturity model incorporates the science of complex systems, cybersecurity frameworks, and two decades of CIP operations experience. The model was successfully applied in resilience assessment projects in a dozen countries. Real-life experience emphasizes the benefits of the sectoral approach to cyber resilience: creating feedback loops within the sector, integrating supply chain and third-party risks, facilitating information flows between stakeholders, enabling cooperation with and among ministries, departments and other authorities, weighting in the links and processes between actors in cybersecurity issues. The established value of the sectoral approach calls for applications that will improve the resilience of essential services while lowering sector-wide cybersecurity expenditures.
