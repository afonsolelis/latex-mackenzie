TI  - Digital Twin: Technology Evolution Stages and Implementation Layers With Technology Elements
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - A digital twin has recently received considerable attention in various industry domains. The digital twin replicates physical objects (e.g., people, objects, spaces, systems, and processes) in the real world into digital objects in the digital world. It also provides various simulations to solve problems in the real world or to improve situational operations. Therefore, the digital twin is a convergence of various technologies, such as advanced machine-learning algorithms, data analytics, super-resolution visualization and modeling, and simulation. Because the digital twin is a complicated technology, a step-by-step implementation that includes many technology elements should be considered to create a digital twin model. In this study, implementation layers are introduced to guide practical implementations of the digital twin. In addition, technology elements were suggested for the presented implementation layers. Because the suggested technology elements include clear technology definitions, various application domains (e.g., energy, transportation, logistics, environment, manufacturing, and smart cities) can easily utilize the introduced implementation layers and technology elements according to the intended purpose. Furthermore, this paper describes the evolution of digital twins. Digital twin technology has evolved continuously since 2002, when the digital twin concept was first introduced. In the described evolution levels, we show the future aspects of digital twin technology, according to the technological evolution direction. Therefore, the digital twin model can be efficiently created by considering the evolution direction and future aspects by using the suggested digital twin evolution levels.

TI  - Digital twin modeling method based on biomimicry for machining aerospace components
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS
AB  - High-performance aerospace component manufacturing requires stringent in-process geometrical and performance-based quality control. Real-time observation, understanding and control of machining processes are integral to optimizing the machining strategies of aerospace component manufacturing. Digital Twin can be used to model, monitor and control the machining process by fusing multi-dimensional in-context machining process data, such as changes in geometry, material properties and machining parameters. However, there is a lack of systematic and efficient Digital Twin modeling method that can adaptively develop high-fidelity multi-scale and multi-dimensional Digital Twins of machining processes. Aiming at addressing this challenge, we proposed a Digital Twin modeling method based on biomimicry principles that can adaptively construct a multi-physics digital twin of the machining process. With this approach, we developed multiple Digital Twin sub-models, e. g., geometry model, behavior model and process model. These Digital Twin sub-models can interact with each other and compose an integrated true representation of the physical machining process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed biomimicry-based Digital Twin modeling method, we tested the method in monitoring and controlling the machining process of an air rudder.

TI  - Composable digital twins on Digital Twin as a Service platform
T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Establishing digital twins is a non-trivial endeavor especially when users face significant challenges in creating them from scratch. Ready availability of re-usable models, data, functions, and tool assets, can help with creation and use of digital twins. A number of frameworks/platforms exist to facilitate creation and use of digital twins. In this paper, we propose such a platform to manage digital twin assets, create composable digital twins from re-usable assets and make the digital twins available as a service to other users. The proposed platform supports the management of re-usable assets, storage, provision of compute infrastructure, communication, monitoring, and execution tasks. Two case studies are used to demonstrate the capabilities of this platform.

TI  - Mechanistic Mathematical Models as a Basis for Digital Twins
T2  - DIGITAL TWINS: TOOLS AND CONCEPTS FOR SMART BIOMANUFACTURING
AB  - A future-oriented approach is the application of Digital Twins for process development, optimization and finally during manufacturing. Digital Twins are detailed virtual representations of bioprocesses with predictive capabilities. In biotechnology, Digital Twins can be used to monitor processes and to provide data for process control and optimization. Central and crucial components of Digital Twins are mathematical process models, which are capable to describe and predict cultivations with high fidelity. Detailed mechanistic models in particular are suitable for both use in Digital Twins and for the development of process control strategies. In this chapter the requirements that process models must fulfil in order to be used for process optimization and finally in Digital Twins will be described. Different types of models, including mechanistic as well as compartmentalized models, are outlined and their application in Digital Twins and for process optimization is explained. Finally, a structured, compartmentalized process model, which was specifically designed for process optimization and has already been used in Digital Twins, is highlighted.

TI  - Decentralized Digital Twin Networks
T2  - IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
AB  - Digital twin networks (DTNs) enable largescale modeling and simulation of complex physical systems by interconnecting virtual replicas of physical objects. However, existing DTNs are highly centralized, which inherently limits their performance during digital twin generation and fault tolerance when facing device failures or malicious attacks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel decentralized digital twin network (DeDTN) paradigm based on blockchain and edge computing technologies. DeDTN achieves high scalability by enabling digital twins to be generated through decentralized edge devices contributed by individual device owners. When confronted with failures or attacks, digital twin consistency is maintained through blockchain consensus among participating devices. Additionally, digital twins are tokenized on-chain to secure ownership and enable seamless sharing between stakeholders. To demonstrate DeDTN's effectiveness, we implement a prototype for transportation traffic modeling in smart cities. Evaluation results show that DeDTN significantly outperforms traditional centralized DTNs in terms of latency and bandwidth efficiency. We also outline several open challenges and future research directions for DeDTN and its applications.

TI  - Automated data transfer for digital twin applications: Two case studies
T2  - WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
AB  - Digital twins have been gaining an immense interest in various fields over the last decade. Bringing conventional process simulation models into (near) real time are thought to provide valuable insights for operators, decision makers, and stakeholders in many industries. The objective of this paper is to describe two methods for implementing digital twins at water resource recovery facilities and highlight and discuss their differences and preferable use situations, with focus on the automated data transfer from the real process. Case 1 uses a tailor-made infrastructure for automated data transfer between the facility and the digital twin. Case 2 uses edge computing for rapid automated data transfer. The data transfer lag from process to digital twin is low compared to the simulation frequency in both systems. The presented digital twin objectives can be achieved using either of the presented methods. The method of Case 1 is better suited for automatic recalibration of model parameters, although workarounds exist for the method in Case 2. The method of Case 2 is well suited for objectives such as soft sensors due to its integration with the SCADA system and low latency. The objective of the digital twin, and the required latency of the system, should guide the choice of method.Practitioner Points Various methods can be used for automated data transfer between the physical system and a digital twin. Delays in the data transfer differ depending on implementation method. The digital twin objective determines the required simulation frequency. Implementation method should be chosen based on the required simulation frequency.
   This paper showcases two case studies for automated data transfer in digital twins. One uses a tailor-made infrastructure for data transfer between the facility and digital twin, the other uses edge computing. The digital twin objective should determine the required simulation frequency and, thus, sets boundaries on suitable implementation methods. image

TI  - Geo-Spatial Context Provision for Digital Twin Generation
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Light detection and ranging technology allows for the creation of detailed 3D point clouds of physical objects and environments. Therefore, it has the potential to provide valuable information for the operation of various kinds of cyber-physical systems that need to be aware of, and interact with, their surroundings, such as autonomous vehicles and robots. Point clouds can also become the basis for the creation of digital representations of different assets and a system's operational environment. This article outlines a system architecture that integrates the geo-spatial context information provided by LiDAR scans with behavioral models of the components of a cyber-physical system to create a digital twin. The clear distinction between behavior and data sets the proposed digital twin architecture apart from existing approaches (that primarily focus on the data aspect), and promotes contextual digital twin generation through executable process models. A vaccine logistics automation use case is detailed to illustrate how information regarding the environment can be used for the operation of an autonomous robot carrying out transport preparation tasks. Besides supporting operation, we propose to combine context data retrieved from the system at different points in the logistics process with information regarding instances of executable behavior models as part of the digital twin architecture. The twin can subsequently be used to facilitate system and process monitoring through relevant stakeholders and structure context data in a user-centric fashion.

TI  - Digital Twin Model Quality Optimization and Control Methods Based on Workflow Management
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Digital twin is an important emerging technology for digital transformation and intelligent upgrading. Digital twin models are the prerequisite for digital twin applications, and their quality directly affects the quality of digital twin services in monitoring, simulation, prediction, optimization, and other areas. However, researchers have paid insufficient attention to the quality control of digital twin models, thus hindering their effective application. To effectively control model construction and optimize model quality in the design process, this study developed digital twin model quality optimization and control methods based on workflow management. First, a workflow process model integrating digital twin model evaluation was constructed, which integrated the design process and model evaluation methods into workflow management. Then, digital twin model quality control and optimization in different stages were achieved at the macro and micro levels. Thus, the digital twin model quality was effectively controlled during the design process, and targeted design resources were selected to optimize model quality. Finally, the validity of the proposed method of model quality optimization and control was verified using the digital twin models of a practical teaching platform and a multifunctional lift-and-slide experimental line. All evaluation indexes of the model achieved good values, and the target quality optimization of the model could be performed during the design process. The results indicate that the proposed method can effectively control and optimize the model quality, which has excellent feasibility and enables the effective application of the digital twin.

TI  - A digital twin emulator of a modular production system using a data-driven hybrid modeling and simulation approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING
AB  - Virtual commissioning is a key technology in Industry 4.0 that can address issues faced by engineers during early design phases. The process of virtual commissioning involves the creation of a Digital Twin-a dynamic, virtual representation of a corresponding physical system. The digital twin model can be used for testing and verifying the control system in a simulated virtual environment to achieve rapid set-up and optimization prior to physical commissioning. Additionally, the modular production control systems, can be integrated and tested during or prior to the construction of the physical system. This paper describes the implementation of a digital twin emulator of an automated mechatronic modular production system that is linked with the running programmable logic controllers and allow for exchanging near real-time information with the physical system. The development and deployment of the digital twin emulator involves a novel hybrid simulation- and data-driven modeling approach that combines Discrete Event Simulation and Agent Based Modeling paradigms. The Digital Twin Emulator can support design decisions, test what-if system configurations, verify and validate the actual behavior of the complete system off-line, test realistic reactions, and provide statistics on the system's performance.

TI  - Modeling and Simulation of Shape Control Based on Digital Twin Technology in Hot Strip Rolling
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - Focusing on the problem of strip shape quality control in the finishing process of hot rolling, a shape model based on metal flow and stress release with the application of varying contact rolling parameters is introduced. Combined with digital twin technology, the digital twin framework of the shape model is proposed, which realizes the deep integration between physical time-space and virtual time-space. With the utilization of the historical data, the parameters are optimized iteratively to complete the digital twin of the shape model. According to the schedule, the raw material information is taken as the input to obtain the simulation of the strip shape, which shows a variety of export shape conditions. The prediction absolute error of the crown and flatness are less than 5 mu m and 5 I-unit, respectively. The results prove that the proposed shape simulation model with strong prediction performance can be effectively applied to hot rolling production. In addition, the proposed model provides operators with a reference for the parameter settings for actual production and promotes the intelligent application of a shape control strategy.

TI  - Research on digital twin modeling method of transformer temperature field based on POD
T2  - ENERGY REPORTS
CP  - 2nd International Joint Conference on Energy and Environmental Engineering (CoEEE)
AB  - For the calculation of transient fluid-solid coupling temperature field of transformer, the traditional Galerkin finite element full order model has the defect that the calculation time is up to hours-level, which is difficult to meet the timeliness requirements of the digital twin model. Firstly, the implementation architecture of transformer digital twin based on IoT is established, and the necessity of multiphysical field simulation and model reduction technology for building the digital twin model is introduced. Then, based on the method of transformer digital twin implementation,it is proposed to combine the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with the finite element (FE) to establish the Galerkin FE full order model for the governing equation of the transient temperature field, the reduced order mode composed of the first several bases is intercepted to build the reduced order model of transient fluid-solid coupling temperature field. Finally, the POD reduced order model is applied to calculate the temperature rise of a transformer. According to the actual transformer temperature rise test, the temperature values of different measuring points are selected to compare the calculation error and time of the reduced order model and the full order model. The results show that the error between the third order model and full order model meets the criterion of POD truncation error, and the calculation time is shortened by 192 times, which can meet the seconds-level calculation requirements.

TI  - Plastic Extrusion Process Optimization by Digital Twins
T2  - CHEMIE INGENIEUR TECHNIK
AB  - Continuous plastics compounding processes are highly complex from a physicochemical point of view and correspondingly difficult to optimize. Model-based digital twins suitable for this purpose require complex simulation approaches, trained personnel and input variables that are difficult to determine. However, data-based digital twins, which are in principle suitable for this purpose, often fail because of the enormous trial effort which is required to generate a sufficiently large database. To overcome this problem this paper describes a hybrid approach for generating the necessary database for a data-based digital twin. By intelligent combination of real experiments, adaptation of the physical-chemical process model to these few experimental data and subsequent data cloud generation with the adapted process model results in a sufficient data base for the digital twin.

TI  - Building a right digital twin with model engineering
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS
AB  - In recent years, the concept of digital twin (DT) is attracting more and more attention from researchers and engineers. But there is still no consensus on what a right DT is. On one hand, some common models are renamed as DTs. On the other hand, some DTs extremely pursue 'the same' as physical objects, which bring unnecessary complexities to them. In this paper, we try to answer two questions from the point of view of model engineering: how to define a right digital twin, and how to build a right digital twin. The concept and related technologies of model engineering are introduced. Some basic principles and a set of metrics for a right DT are given. An evolutionary concurrent modeling method for DT (ECoM4DT) is proposed not only inheriting the theory from classic M&S methods but also highlighting the characteristics of DT compared with traditional models to systemically guide the DT modeling process.

TI  - Digital twin implementation approach in supply chain processes
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
AB  - Integrating technology and data throughout value chains is critical for achieving efficiency. Smart technologies that enable innovation and continuous improvement are key to long-term success. Modelling and simulation of business processes help to better understand existing systems and optimize processes. However, current approaches to digital transformation tend to focus solely on outcomes rather than the strategic methodology needed for successful implementation, resulting in differing valuations of solutions investments. This paper's significant contribution is intro-ducing a new conceptual implementation method for digital twin technology in supply chain processes. This methodology enables technology and system evaluation at the process study stage, and a stylized business case demonstrates its application in a real-world scenario involving digital twin integration into order fulfilment in a manufacturing factory using Business Process Model-ling Notation (BPMN) to simulate "As-Is" and "To-Be" processes.

TI  - Development of a Process Digital Twin in Camunda Modeler
T2  - TEM JOURNAL-TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION MANAGEMENT INFORMATICS
AB  - Business process modeling is one of the most important steps in managing the lifecycle of a business process. A digital twin of a business process is a virtual model of a business process designed to replicate the behavior of a real business process. The difference between a digital twin and a business process simulation is that the simulation does not require real-time data, while a digital twin is created based on real-time data. A digital twin comprises a physical entity in the real world, a software-based digital counterpart, and the data that links them both. When a created process communicates in real time with IoT devices and adapts its execution based on the information received in real time, this is referred to as a process digital twin. As the field of digital twins becomes increasingly popular, the challenge is to investigate how the process digital twin communicates with IoT devices in real time and updates its execution state.

TI  - Combining Green Metrics and Digital Twins for Sustainability Planning and Governance of Smart Buildings and Cities
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Creating a more sustainable world will require a coordinated effort to address the rise of social, economic, and environmental concerns resulting from the continuous growth of cities. Supporting planners with tools to address them is pivotal, and sustainability is one of the main objectives. Modeling and simulation augmenting digital twins can play an important role to implement these tools. Although various green best practices have been utilized over time and there are related attempts at measuring green success, works in the published literature tend to focus on addressing a single problem (e.g., energy efficiency), and a comprehensive approach that takes the multiple facets of sustainable urban planning into consideration has not yet been identified. This paper begins with a review of recent research efforts in green metrics and digital twins. This leads to developing an approach that evaluates organizational green best practices to derive metrics, which are used for computational decision support by digital twins. Furthermore, it leverages these research results and proposes a metric-driven framework for sustainability planning that understands a city as a sociotechnical complex system. Such a framework allows the practitioner to take advantage of recent developments and provides computational decision support for the complex challenge of sustainability planning at the various levels of urban planning and governance.

TI  - A framework and method for equipment digital twin dynamic evolution based on IExATCN
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING
AB  - Dynamic evolution is the most typical feature of a digital twin, making it different from a traditional digital model. Dynamic evolution is also the core technology for building equipment digital twins because it ensures consistency between physical space and virtual space. This paper proposes a dynamic evolution framework for black box equipment digital twins. The framework consists of three main parts: data acquisition and processing, an evolution triggering mechanism and an evolution algorithm. A formal description of the dynamic evolution of a black box digital twin is also given. Furthermore, by synthetically considering the computational accuracy and efficiency, we design an incremental external attention temporal convolution network (IExATCN) model to instantiate the proposed framework. Finally, the significance of digital twin dynamic evolution and the effectiveness of the IExATCN is verified by 3D equipment attitude estimation datasets.

TI  - Digital twin modeling method based on IFC standards for building construction processes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH
AB  - Intelligent construction is a necessary way to improve the traditional construction method, and digital twin can be a crucial technology to promote intelligent construction. However, the construction field currently needs a unified method to build a standardized and universally applicable digital twin model, which is incredibly challenging in construction. Therefore, this paper proposes a general method to construct a digital twin construction process model based on the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard, aiming to realize real-time monitoring, control, and visualization management of the construction site. The method constructs a digital twin fusion model from three levels: geometric model, resource model, and behavioral model by establishing an IFC semantic model of the construction process, storing the fusion model data and the construction site data into a database, and completing the dynamic interaction of the twin data in the database. At the same time, the digital twin platform is developed to realize the visualization and control of the construction site. Combined with practical cases and analysis, the implementation effect of the method is shown and verified.

TI  - Multimedia knowledge-based bridge health monitoring using digital twin
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - Digital twins are virtual replicas of real physical entities in computers. They can be considered as abstract digital models of data and behavior for objects of interest. Nevertheless, they are not perfectly consistent with conventional data or simulation models because they achieve prediction and optimization by simulating the abstract digital model of a particular system. To maintain the characteristics of digital twins in the virtual space, digital simulation models that continue to update, change, and evolve according to continuous changes of corresponding physical factors must be used. Owing to the various advantages of digital twin technology, digital twins have gained more attention. However, the method to create digital twins is still unclear. Additionally, the availability and sufficiency of information on physical entities to which digital twins will be applied must be considered, and a model suitable for their application must be designed. Therefore, multimedia knowledge-based bridge health monitoring using digital twins is proposed herein. It synchronizes real and virtual spaces to reflect the reality based on various data collected using sensors of real systems. In this study, various situations of virtual bridge twins in a facility management area are simulated to provide digital services to ensure bridge health. This digital bridge health service analyzes situations based on a small amount of data collected from a bridge, predicts the optimal time point for maintenance, and then applies it to the real world. Hence, maintenance costs can be reduced and the bridge's lifespan extended.

TI  - DTPAAL: Digital Twinning Pepper and Ambient Assisted Living
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB  - Pepper is a humanoid robot capable of expressing body language, perceiving, and interacting with its surrounding environment, thanks to a wide set of sensors and actuators and exposing capabilities and high-level interfaces for natural interaction with humans. In this article, we present the development of VPepper, the Pepper virtual replica, by describing experiences focused on the interaction of the digital twin with the replicas of the smart objects in a smart home. Pepper robot has been featured with arms and hands, but its motors and actuators cannot support intensive experimental sessions and training procedures to learn how safely touch objects. Here, digital twin metaphor plays a crucial role. By a virtual and reliable replica of the robot, machine learning procedures can be seamlessly moved to/from the digital twin with a significant speedup and preventing the physical robot from deterioration. As a practical application, the reported case study is inspired to ambient-assisted living in elderly assistance. The experience, as well as the entire design and development process, has revealed VPepper and the smart environment to offer interesting opportunities for the physical accuracy of the simulation and for the availability of machine learning instruments that may be converted and adopted for real settings. A final empirical evaluation, performed involving 25 volunteer caregivers, confirms the perceived value and the potential usefulness of the system.

TI  - A Digital Twin-Based Environment-Adaptive Assignment Method for Human-Robot Collaboration
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB  - Human-robot collaboration, which strives to combine the best skills of humans and robots, has shown board application prospects in meeting safe-effective-flexible requirements in various fields. The ideation of much closer interaction between humans and robots has greatly developed the exploration of digital twin to enhance collaboration. By offering high-fidelity models and real-time physical-virtual interaction, the digital twin enables to achieve an accurate reflection of the physical scenario, including not only human-robot conditions but also environmental changes. However, the appearance of unpredictable events may cause an inconsistency between the established schedule and actual execution. To cope with this issue, an environment-adaptive assignment method based on digital twin for human-robot collaboration is formed in this study. The proposed approach consists of a factor-event-act mechanism that analyzes the dynamic events and their impacts from both internal and external perspectives of digital twin and a genetic algorithm-based assignment algorithm to respond to them. Experiments are carried out in the last part, aiming to show the feasibility of the proposed method.

TI  - Federation in Digital Twins and Knowledge Transfer: Modeling Limitations and Enhancement
T2  - MACHINES
AB  - Digital twins (DTs) consist of various technologies and therefore require a wide range of data. However, many businesses often face challenges in providing sufficient data due to technical limitations or business constraints. This can result in inadequate data for training or calibrating the models used within a digital twin. This paper aims to explore how knowledge can be generated from federated digital twins-an approach that lies between digital twin networks and collaborative manufacturing-and how this can be used to enhance understanding for both AI systems and humans. Inspired by the concept of federated machine learning, where data and algorithms are shared across different stakeholders, this idea involves different companies collaborating through their respective DTs, a situation which can be referred to as federated twinning. As a result, the models within these DTs can be enriched with more-detailed information, leading to the creation of verified, high-fidelity models. Human involvement is also emphasized, particularly in the transfer of knowledge. This can be applied to the modeling process itself, which is the primary focus here, or to any control design aspect. Specifically, the paradigm of thermal process modeling is used to illustrate how federated digital twins can help refine underlying models. Two sequential cases are considered: the first one is used to study the type of knowledge that is required from modeling and federation; while the second one investigates the creation of a more suitable form of modeling.

TI  - Agile Construction Digital Twin Engineering
T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - Digital twins have attracted a lot of attention recently. However, the current manifestations are merely digital shadows, lacking means for bidirectional data exchange, which makes their use for assisting the construction of buildings much more difficult. We argue that this is due to the lack of a systematic process for developing a digital twin during a building's life cycle. We argue to look for a solution by combining agile engineering with IT change management to establish an agile, change-driven process for engineering digital twins. Such a process, of course, deserves a qualitative assessment of the engineering process and the resulting digital twin. In the future, it should be possible to obtain a digital twin from a BIM-based design process by applying IT change management in an agile manner. This should happen under maximum automation and life cycle orientation. Our proposal is motivated by several years of interdisciplinary collaboration between civil engineering and computer science and evaluated using the Technology Acceptance Model. While the TAM is not specifically designed for digital twin methodologies, its application here aims to assess perceived usefulness and ease of use of DT methodologies from the user's perspective, without addressing scalability concerns. This aims to provide actionable insights to guide the refinement of the process model, aligning it with user requirements and achieving its intended outcomes. Our evaluation confirms the proposed process's perceived usefulness and ease of use, with robust correlations indicating strong acceptance potential among stakeholders. These results highlight the feasibility of the proposed approach and its alignment with expectations in real-world applications.

TI  - Structured Development of Digital Twins-A Cross-Domain Analysis towards a Unified Approach
T2  - PROCESSES
AB  - Digital Twins (DT) as digital representations are increasingly becoming operational design tools in a variety of contexts. Although a common understanding of the concept and the underlying development procedure would facilitate DT applications, only limited information has been published on the essential stages of development and fundamental development activities. This paper examines the extent to which an abstract, and thus generally applicable model for the development of Digital Twins can be identified. In order to come up with such a reference procedure, a structured analysis of published development experiences has been performed. Three major application domains, namely product lifecycle management, manufacturing, and predictive maintenance, could be detailed and cross-checked. For each of these domains, a contextual development model could be derived from empirically valid design and engineering practices. The data also allowed for the determination of which way each model corresponds to existing Digital Twin concepts. The use of a standard modeling notation enabled the integration of the domain-specific models into a single Digital Twin development model. As a result, developers are guided by domain-independent and -dependent development steps. Due to its generic structure, the model can serve for further domain explorations.

TI  - A BIM-data mining integrated digital twin framework for advanced project management
T2  - AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION
AB  - With the focus of smart construction project management, this paper presents a closed-loop digital twin framework under the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), and data mining (DM) techniques. To be specific, IoT connects the physical and cyber world to capture real-time data for modeling and analyzing, and data mining methods incorporated in the virtual model aim to discover hidden knowledge in collected data. The proposed digital twin has been verified in a practical BIM-based project. Based on large inspection data from IoT devices, the 4D visualization and task-centered or worker-centered process model are built as the virtual model to simulate both the task execution and worker cooperation. Then, the highfidelity virtual model is investigated by process mining and time series analysis. Results show that possible bottlenecks in the current process can be foreseen using the fuzzy miner, while the number of finished tasks in the next phase can be predicted by the multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) model. Consequently, tactic decision-making can realize to not only prevent possible failure in advance, but also arrange work and staffing reasonably to make the process adapt to changeable conditions. In short, the significance of this paper is to build a data-driven digital twin framework integrating with BIM, IoT, and data mining for advanced project management, which can facilitate data communication and exploration to better understand, predict, and optimize the physical construction operations. In future works, more complex cases with multiple data streams will be used to test the developed framework, and more detailed interpretations with the actual observations of construction activities will be given.

TI  - Guided Bayesian Optimization: Data-Efficient Controller Tuning With Digital Twin
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB  - This article presents the guided Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm as an efficient data-driven method for iteratively tuning closed-loop controller parameters using a digital twin of the system. The digital twin is built using closed-loop data acquired during standard BO iterations, and activated when the uncertainty in the Gaussian Process model of the optimization objective on the real system is high. We define a controller tuning framework independent of the controller or the plant structure. Our proposed methodology is model-free, making it suitable for nonlinear and unmodelled plants with measurement noise. The objective function consists of performance metrics modeled by Gaussian processes. We utilize the available information in the closed-loop system to progressively maintain a digital twin that guides the optimizer, improving the data efficiency of our method. Switching the digital twin on and off is triggered by our data-driven criteria related to the digital twin's uncertainty estimations in the BO tuning framework. Effectively, it replaces much of the exploration of the real system with exploration performed on the digital twin. We analyze the properties of our method in simulation and demonstrate its performance on two real closed-loop systems with different plant and controller structures. The experimental results show that our method requires fewer experiments on the physical plant than Bayesian optimization to find the optimal controller parameters. Note to Practitioners-Industrial applications typically are difficult to model due to disturbances. Bayesian optimization is a data-efficient iterative tuning method for a black box system in which the performance can only be measured given the control parameters. Iterative measurements involve operational costs. We propose a guided Bayesian optimization method that uses all information flow in a system to define a simplified digital twin of the system using out-of-the-box methods. It is continuously updated with data from the system. We use the digital twin instead of the real system to perform experiments and to find optimal controller parameters while we monitor the uncertainty of the resulting predictions. When the uncertainty exceeds a tolerance threshold, the real system is measured, and the digital twin is updated. This results in fewer experiments on the real system only when needed. We then demonstrate the improved data efficiency of the guided Bayesian optimization on real-time linear and rotary motor hardware. These common industrial plants need to be controlled rigorously in a closed-loop system. Our method requires $57\%$ and $46\%$ fewer experiments on the hardware than Bayesian optimization to tune the control parameters of the linear and rotary motor systems. Our generic approach is not limited to the controller parameters but also can optimize the parameters of a manufacturing process.

TI  - A New Concept of Digital Twin Supporting Optimization and Resilience of Factories of the Future
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Featured Application This work was elaborated in the frame of a collaborative innovation project named CyberFactory#1 which aims at enhancing optimization and resilience of Factories of the Future. Its outcomes will be tested and demonstrated in application to industrial use-cases provided by eight pilot factories across Europe in sectors such as aerospace system manufacturing, industrial machine fabrication, consumer electronics and textile industry. One of these use-cases is provided as an illustration of the approach in the field of Aerospace System Manufacturing. In the context of Industry 4.0, a growing use is being made of simulation-based decision-support tools commonly named Digital Twins. Digital Twins are replicas of the physical manufacturing assets, providing means for the monitoring and control of individual assets. Although extensive research on Digital Twins and their applications has been carried out, the majority of existing approaches are asset specific. Little consideration is made of human factors and interdependencies between different production assets are commonly ignored. In this paper, we address those limitations and propose innovations for cognitive modeling and co-simulation which may unleash novel uses of Digital Twins in Factories of the Future. We introduce a holistic Digital Twin approach, in which the factory is not represented by a set of separated Digital Twins but by a comprehensive modeling and simulation capacity embracing the full manufacturing process including external network dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce novel approaches for integrating models of human behavior and capacities for security testing with Digital Twins and show how the holistic Digital Twin can enable new services for the optimization and resilience of Factories of the Future. To illustrate this approach, we introduce a specific use-case implemented in field of Aerospace System Manufacturing.

TI  - On the alleviation of imminent technical and business challenges of long-lasting functional digital twins
T2  - COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY
AB  - In this article, we discuss the technical and business risks associated with long-lasting functional digital twins, and describe different strategies for their alleviation. Functional digital twins are based on physics based simulation models and are operated alongside the life cycle of their physical counterparts. These simulation-based digital twins are built using a simulation software. The problems with most of the commercial modeling and simulation tools are their black box nature and storing data in protective formats, leading to poor interoperability. Since the digital twins of certain assets need to be operated for a long period, even for several decades, there is a possibility that the computing infrastructure, i.e., the computing hardware and software, may not remain the same throughout the product or system life cycle. The computer hardware and operating systems are usually third-party components with limited choices for their users, whereas the selection of simulation tools is more flexible and the designer can choose from, for example, commercial, open-source, or in-house solutions. To avoid substantial costs or business disruption, the digital twin providers must be able to reproduce the underlying simulation models with up-to-date tools and adopt alternative solutions whenever needed. The findings of the study are presented in the form of propositions throughout the article.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. CC_BY_4.0

TI  - Toward a digital twin of a robot workcell: standards and methods
T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Digital twins are poised to improve the engineering, operation, and management of manufacturing facilities. However, implementing digital twins has been a challenge primarily due to a lack of resources and the absence of standardized digital twin frameworks and methods. This paper describes creating a digital twin of a robot workcell using available standards, tools, and methods. The workcell comprises collaborative robot arms, a computer numeric control (CNC) machine tool, and a coordinate measuring machine (CMM). The ISO 23247 standard provides a guideline for building the digital twin. Data are collected from physical devices and the MTConnect standard provides a format for communicating the data between the physical equipment and their digital counterparts. The machine components in the workcell are represented as models in the virtual world. This research shows that the above standards and methods support building a digital twin of a robot workcell. The data collected and communicated can be used to improve workcell functions such as quality management and predictive maintenance.

TI  - Digital Twin Implementation for Manufacturing of Adjuvants
T2  - PROCESSES
AB  - Pharmaceutical manufacturing processes are moving towards automation and real-time process monitoring with the help of process analytical technologies (PATs) and predictive process models representing the real system. In this paper, we present a digital twin developed for an adjuvant manufacturing process involving a microfluidic formation of lipid particles. The twin uses a hybrid model for estimating the current state of the process and predicting system behavior in real time. The twin is used to control the adjuvant particle size, a critical quality attribute, by varying process parameters such as the temperature and inlet flow rates. We describe steps in the design and implementation of the twin, starting from the conception of the mechanistic model, up to the generation of its surrogate model used as state estimator, PATs and the setup of the information technology-Operational technology architecture. We demonstrate the performance of the twin by introducing different disturbances in the process and comparing the effect on the product critical quality attributes with and without the control of the digital twin. Finally, we showcase the digital twin implementation for the process in good manufacturing practice, through an engineering run, which demonstrated the robustness of the process when controlled by the digital twin.

TI  - Regression Metamodel-Based Digital Twin for an Industrial Dynamic Crossflow Filtration Process
T2  - BIOENGINEERING-BASEL
AB  - Dynamic crossflow filtration (DCF) is the state-of-the-art technology for solid-liquid separation from viscous and sensitive feed streams in the food and biopharma industry. Up to now, the potential of industrial processes is often not fully exploited, because fixed recipes are usually applied to run the processes. In order to take the varying properties of biological feed materials into account, we aim to develop a digital twin of an industrial brownfield DCF plant, allowing to optimize setpoint decisions in almost real time. The core of the digital twin is a mechanistic-empirical process model combining fundamental filtration laws with process expert knowledge. The effect of variation in the selected process and model parameters on plant productivity has been assessed using a model-based design-of-experiments approach, and a regression metamodel has been trained with the data. A cyclic program that bidirectionally communicates with the DCF asset serves as frame of the digital twin. It monitors the process dynamics membrane torque and transmembrane pressure and feeds back the optimum permeate flow rate setpoint to the physical asset in almost real-time during process runs. We considered a total of 24 industrial production batches from the filtration of grape juice from the years 2022 and 2023 in the study. After implementation of the digital twin on site, the campaign mean productivity increased by 15% over the course of the year 2023. The presented digital twin framework is a simple example how an industrial established process can be controlled by a hybrid model-based algorithm. With a digital process dynamics model at hand, the presented metamodel optimization approach can be easily transferred to other (bio)chemical processes.

TI  - DT-II:Digital twin enhanced Industrial Internet reference framework towards smart manufacturing
T2  - ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING
AB  - In this paper, the interplay and relationship between digital twin and Industrial Internet are discussed at first. The sensing/transmission network capability, which is one of the main characteristics of Industrial Internet, can be a carrier for providing digital twin with a means of data acquisition and transmission. Conversely, with the capability of high-fidelity virtual modeling and simulation computing/analysis, digital twin evolving from lifecycle management for a single product to application in production/manufacturing in the shop-floor/enterprise, can further greatly enhance the simulation computing and analysis of Industrial Internet. This paper proposes a digital twin enhanced Industrial Internet (DT-II) reference framework towards smart manufacturing. To further illustrate the reference framework, the implementation and operation mechanism of DT-II is discussed from three perspectives, including product lifecycle level, infra-enterprise level and inter-enterprise level. Finally, steam turbine is taken as an example to illustrate the application scenes from above three perspectives under the circumstance of DT-II. The differences between with and without DT-II for design and development of steam turbine are also presented.

T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - This study addresses the challenges associated with virtual-real interactions, the limitations of one-dimensional data presentation, restricted real-time functionalities, and the lack of effective models for monitoring production line status. It specifically investigates intelligent production lines for automotive wheels as the focal point of the research. This study explores the construction methodology and the application of intelligent production lines through the utilization of digital twin technology. A hierarchical design approach is employed, integrating industrial Internet of Things (IoT) technology to create a comprehensive digital twin system. This system consists of four layers: the physical production line layer, the data acquisition and processing layer, the digital twin production line layer, and the application service layer. Precise mapping from the physical production line to the digital twin model is achieved using the advanced 3D modeling and simulation software, PQ Factory, while real-time data collection and transmission are facilitated through the standardized OPC UA protocol. The effectiveness of the system is substantiated through a detailed case study. The findings demonstrate that the intelligent production line system, which leverages digital twin technology for automotive wheels, enables real-time monitoring of the production process and provides innovative solutions, along with a robust theoretical framework for comprehensive analysis, diagnosis, evaluation, optimization, prediction, and decision making in the production of automotive wheels.

AB  - Digital twin (DT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are powerful enablers for Industry 4.0 toward sustainable resilient manufacturing. Digital twins of machine tools and machining processes combine advanced digital techniques and production domain knowledge, facilitate the enhancement of agility, traceability, and resilience of production systems, and help machine tool builders achieve a paradigm shift from one-time products provision to on-going service delivery. However, the adaptability and accuracy of digital twins at the shopfloor level are restricted by heterogeneous data sources, modeling precision as well as uncertainties from dynamical industrial environments. This article proposes a novel modeling framework to address these inadequacies by in-depth integrating AI techniques and machine tool expertise using aggregated data along the product development process. A data processing procedure is constructed to contextualize metadata sources from the design, planning, manufacturing, and quality stages and link them into a digital thread. On this consistent data basis, a modeling pipeline is presented to incorporate production and machine tool prior knowledge into AI development pipeline, while considering the multi-fidelity nature of data sources in dynamic industrial circumstances. In terms of implementation, we first introduce our existing work for building digital twins of machine tool and manufacturing process. Within this infrastructure, we developed a hybrid learning -based digital twin for manufacturing process following proposed modeling framework and tested it in an external industrial project exemplarily for real-time workpiece quality monitoring. The result indicates that the proposed hybrid learning-based digital twin enables learning uncertainties of the interaction of machine tools and machining processes in real industrial environments, thus allows estimating and enhancing the modeling reliability, depending on the data quality and accessibility. Prospectively, it also contributes to the reparametrization of model parameters and to the adaptive process control.

TI  - Flexible digital twins from commercial off-the-shelf software solutions: a driver for energy efficiency and decarbonisation in process industries?
T2  - CHEMICAL PRODUCT AND PROCESS MODELING
AB  - The term 'digital twin' refers to a virtual simulation/model (virtual twin) of a physical plant or object (physical twin), where data flows between the virtual and physical twins. A digital twin can be used for different purposes, such as process optimisation/control, design, training, and maintenance/service. This manuscript found an increasing number of simulation and modelling publications in literature year on year, which illustrates the current trend towards implementing digital twins in a broad range of process engineering applications. A targeted literature review into the area found several commercial off-the-shelf software solutions (COTS) for different industrial applications providing the necessary flexibility to analyse a broad range of industries. However, most of the process modelling software is designed for petroleum and fine chemicals processes. There is still a need for software solutions that can model a broader range of applications. While most of the software found was licensed, open source process modelling software was also available. There is a lack of independent research into the accuracy of these software solutions. The literature review also found that 37% of the research based on process simulations is carried out to improve energy efficiencies. In comparison, 27% of the research found Decarbonization to be a secondary "added" benefit. It can be concluded that digital twins are ideally suited for driving energy efficiency improvements and decarbonisation goals. However, none of the COTS identified in the literature meets all the requirements for a digital twin. A solution to this problem is to create a layered digital twin, combining and interfacing different tools to accomplish a visually similar, self-optimising, self-learning virtual plant.

TI  - Digital twin modeling and simulation method for production line equipment units
T2  - JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - This study delves into enhancing the digital transformation of the discrete manufacturing sector through cutting-edge information technology, specifically digital twin technology. It tackles issues such as the absence of real-time data refreshes and a neglect of individual production units, which hinder the effective monitoring and fault detection of equipment, as well as decision-making delays, reduced production efficiency and other problems. By employing NX MCD simulation, this study introduces a comprehensive digital twin model for production line equipment units, covering aspects like 3D visualization (property model), operational logic (logic model), seamless virtual-physical integration for real-time updates (communication model: The model connects the channel between virtual and physical space, solves the problem of lack of real-time data update), and enabling dynamic production line simulations (simulation model). This innovative framework fosters a direct, real-time link between designers and the digital environment, facilitating ongoing monitoring, preemptive fault detection, and constant optimization of production processes. The efficacy of this approach is underscored by a case study on a pivotal production station, showcasing successful real-time equipment surveillance and validating the practicality of this digital twin strategy.

TI  - Knowledge driven multiview bill of material reconfiguration for complex products in the digital twin workshop
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB  - For the problem of long modeling time and large workload of multiview bill of material (XBOM) reconstruction process in digital twin shop, this paper proposes a knowledge-driven XBOM reconstruction method for complex products. Through the research of knowledge base construction, the modeling and simulation analysis of XBOM reconstruction process in digital twin workshop are supported, so as to shorten the cycle and improve efficiency and quality. Taking the maintenance history data of the typical representative electric multiple unit (EMU) bogies in complex products as the research object, the bidirectional long short-term memory neural network with conditional random field (BiLSTM-CRF) algorithm is used to complete the entity recognition of maintenance BOM (WBOM) reconstructed parts. Finally, taking the XBOM reconstruction process of the bogie of an enterprise as an example, the XBOM reconstruction knowledge base interaction system of the EMU bogie is built. It verifies the feasibility of the method proposed in this paper, and provides knowledge support for the XBOM reconstruction process of complex products in the digital twin workshop.

TI  - A multi-dimensional evolution modeling method for digital twin process model
T2  - ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING
AB  - Digital twin, visually monitor the dynamic evolution process of part cutting in a digital way, which has attracted widespread attention in smart manufacturing. Under this background, creating a high fidelity and evolvable virtual model has become the key to putting digital twin into practice in the manufacturing field. However, the 3D process model pays scant attention on the dynamically machining process, multi-dimensional evolutionary machining feature, and not even the coupling machining semantics. How to realize the evolution process model creation from the perspective of semantics dimension, time dimension, and feature dimension, an evolutionary concurrent modeling method is proposed based on the process knowledge and machining feature. Firstly, the geometric evolution process of typical features is analyzed, and the association mechanism between processing semantics and evolution features is constructed. Secondly, the mathematical model of the evolution feature is constructed based on the part processing information, and the creation method of processing semantics-driven evolutionary feature is proposed. Thirdly, the association mechanism of "machining semantics-process parameters-geometric features" is built, and the dynamic evolution process model which achieve synchronous evolution with the processing is created based on machining semantics. Finally, a case study is carried out with typical processing feature. The results show that the multi-dimensional evolution modeling of the digital twin process model can realize the synchronous visual monitoring and simulation of product processing. The correlation based on semantic features can improve the efficiency and quality of process model construction and provide solutions for dynamic analysis and decision-making of smart process design.

TI  - Building Digital Twins to Overcome Digitalization Barriers for Automating Construction Site Management
T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - Construction sites are highly unpredictable environments involving a wide variety of stakeholders with complex information exchanges, which lead to the well-known inefficiencies and unproductivity of the construction sector. The adoption of Building Digital Twins (BDT) in the construction site is a promising solution to this issue, by automating data acquisition and knowledge extraction processes and providing what-if scenario simulation capabilities. Furthermore, the current research sets the principles to define, replicate, and scale-up the architecture of a Building Digital Twin Platform (BDTP), conceived as a scalar ecosystem, which allows to seamlessly manage on-site construction processes, integrating cross-cutting domains for the construction site optimization (Progress monitoring, Quality control, Operational Health and Safety, Equipment control, and Production planning). The starting point of the research is a comprehensive diagnosis of on-site process inefficiencies and the barriers to its digitalization leading to the user requirements, which have been underpinned by questionnaires and interviews addressed within an open innovation user-centered approach around Living Labs. The research has been conceived following the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology and based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) analysis for the continuous improvement of the construction process. By means of the adoption of the standard Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), based on the BDTP architecture, the research has resulted in BPMN workflows stemmed from the Digital Twin (DT) where the DT itself is an actor in a service-oriented data-exchange workflow. Moreover, the use of a BDTP can pave the way for the transition from user-driven construction management to hybrid management, coexisting with both human and digital actors and merging expert knowledge with artificial intelligence techniques.

TI  - Integration of Design, Manufacturing, and Service Based on Digital Twin to Realize Intelligent Manufacturing
T2  - MACHINES
AB  - Complex product design, manufacturing, and service are the key elements of a product's life cycle. However, the traditional manufacturing processes of design, manufacturing, and service are independent of each other, so lack deep integration. The emergence of digital twins offers an opportunity to accelerate the integration of complex product design, manufacturing, and services. For intelligent manufacturing, physical entity and virtual entity transformation can be realized through digital information. A collaborative framework for complex product design, manufacturing, and service integration based on digital twin technology was proposed. The solutions of process integration, data flow, modeling and simulation, and information fusion were analyzed. The core characteristics and key technologies of service-oriented manufacturing, design for service and manufacturing, and manufacturing monitoring based on the deep integration of the digital twin were discussed. Finally, the feasibility of the framework was verified by a self-balancing multistage pump manufacturing case. The performance of the upgraded pump under the framework was tested, and the test results proved the effectiveness of the integrated framework.

TI  - Physics encoded blocks in residual neural network architectures for digital twin models
T2  - MACHINE LEARNING
AB  - Physics Informed Machine Learning has emerged as a popular approach for modeling and simulation in digital twins, enabling the generation of accurate models of processes and behaviors in real-world systems. However, existing methods either rely on simple loss regularizations that offer limited physics integration or employ highly specialized architectures that are difficult to generalize across diverse physical systems. This paper presents a generic approach based on a novel physics-encoded residual neural network (PERNN) architecture that seamlessly combines data-driven and physics-based analytical models to overcome these limitations. Our method integrates differentiable physics blocks-implementing mathematical operators from physics-based models-with feed-forward learning blocks, while intermediate residual blocks ensure stable gradient flow during training. Consequently, the model naturally adheres to the underlying physical principles even when prior physics knowledge is incomplete, thereby improving generalizability with low data requirements and reduced model complexity. We investigate our approach in two application domains. The first is a steering model for autonomous vehicles in a simulation environment, and the second is a digital twin for climate modeling using an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based model of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) to enable gap-filling in flux tower data. In both cases, our method outperforms conventional neural network approaches as well as state-of-the-art Physics Informed Machine Learning methods.

TI  - Digital Twin Implementation of Autonomous Planning Arc Welding Robot System
T2  - COMPLEX SYSTEM MODELING AND SIMULATION
AB  - Industrial robots are currently applied for ship sub-assembly welding to replace welding workers because of the intelligent production and cost savings. In order to improve the efficiency of the robot system, a digital twin system of welding path planning for the arc welding robot in ship sub-assembly welding is proposed in this manuscript to achieve autonomous planning and generation of the welding path. First, a five-dimensional digital twin model of the dual arc welding robot system is constructed. Then, the system kinematics analysis and calibration are studied for communication realization between the virtual and the actual system. Besides, a topology consisting of three bounding volume hierarchies (BVH) trees is proposed to construct digital twin virtual entities in this system. Based on this topology, algorithms for welding seam extraction and collision detection are presented. Finally, the genetic algorithm and the RRT-Connect algorithm combined with region partitioning (RRT-Connect-RP) are applied for the welding sequence global planning and local jump path planning, respectively. The digital twin system and its path planning application are tested in the actual application scenario. The results show that the system can not only simulate the actual welding operation of the arc welding robot but also realize path planning and real-time control of the robot.

TI  - Digital Twin Enabled Process Development, Optimization and Control in Lyophilization for Enhanced Biopharmaceutical Production
T2  - PROCESSES
AB  - Digital twins have emerged as a powerful concept for real-time monitoring and analysis, facilitating Quality by Design integration into biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Traditionally, lyophilization processes are developed through trial-and-error, incorporating high security margins and inflexible process set points. Digital twins enable the integration of adaptable operating conditions and implementation of automation through Advanced Process Control (APC) with Process Analytical Technology (PAT) and validated physicochemical models that rely on heat and mass transfer principles, allowing us to overcome the challenges imposed by the lyophilization process. In this study, a digital twin for freeze-drying processes is developed and experimentally validated. Using the digital twin, primary drying conditions were optimized for controlled nucleation and annealing methods by carrying out a few laboratory tests beforehand. By incorporating PAT and modeling, the digital twin accurately predicts the product's temperature and drying endpoint, showing smaller errors than the experiments. The digital twin significantly increases productivity by up to 300% while reducing the costs by 74% and the Global Warming Potential by 64%.

TI  - A full-scale operational digital twin for a water resource recovery facility-A case study of Eindhoven Water Resource Recovery Facility
T2  - WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
AB  - Digital transformation for the water sector has gained momentum in recent years, and many water resource recovery facilities modelers have already started transitioning from developing traditional models to digital twin (DT) applications. DTs simulate the operation of treatment plants in near real time and provide a powerful tool to the operators and process engineers for real-time scenario analysis and calamity mitigation, online process optimization, predictive maintenance, model-based control, and so forth. So far, only a few mature examples of full-scale DT implementations can be found in the literature, which only address some of the key requirements of a DT. This paper presents the development of a full-scale operational DT for the Eindhoven water resource recovery facility in The Netherlands, which includes a fully automated data-pipeline combined with a detailed mechanistic full-plant process model and a user interface co-created with the plant's operators. The automated data preprocessing pipeline provides continuous access to validated data, an influent generator provides dynamic predictions of influent composition data and allows forecasting 48 h into the future, and an advanced compartmental model of the aeration and anoxic bioreactors ensures high predictive power. The DT runs near real-time simulations every 2 h. Visualization and interaction with the DT is facilitated by the cloud-based TwinPlant technology, which was developed in close interaction with the plant's operators. A set of predefined handles are made available, allowing users to simulate hypothetical scenarios such as process and equipment failures and changes in controller settings. The combination of the advanced data pipeline and process model development used in the Eindhoven DT and the active involvement of the operators/process engineers/managers in the development process makes the twin a valuable asset for decision making with long-term reliability.Practitioner Points A full-scale digital twin (DT) has been developed for the Eindhoven WRRF. The Eindhoven DT includes an automated continuous data preprocessing and reconciliation pipeline. A full-plant mechanistic compartmental process model of the plant has been developed based on hydrodynamic studies. The interactive user interface of the Eindhoven DT allows operators to perform what-if scenarios on various operational settings and process inputs. Plant operators were actively involved in the DT development process to make a reliable and relevant tool with the expected added value.
   The Eindhoven digital twin provides the plant operators and managers with a decision-support tool for real-time plant simulation, calamity detection, and scenario analysis.

However, current digital twins are largely the result of bespoke technical solutions that are difficult to scale. We discuss two exemplar applications that motivate challenges and opportunities for scaling digital twins, and that underscore potential barriers to wider adoption of this technology.

TI  - Digital Twin-Enhanced Control for Fuel Cell and Lithium-Ion Battery Hybrid Vehicles
T2  - BATTERIES-BASEL
AB  - With the development of lithium-ion batteries and fuel cells, the application of hybrid power systems is becoming more and more widespread. To better optimize the energy management problem of fuel cell hybrid systems, the accuracy of system modeling and simulation is very important. The hybrid system is formed by connecting the battery to the fuel cell through an active topology. Digital twin technology is applicable to the mapping of physical entities to each other with high interactivity and fast optimization iterations. In this paper, a relevant model based on mathematical logic is established by collecting actual operational data; subsequently, the accuracy of the model is verified by combining relevant operating conditions and simulating the model. Subsequently, a three-dimensional visualization model of a hybrid power system-based sightseeing vehicle and its operating environment was established using digital twin technology to improve the model simulation of the fuel cell hybrid power system. At low speeds, the simulation results of the hybrid power system-based sightseeing vehicle have a small error compared with the actual running state, and the accuracy of the data related to each internal subcomponent is high. In the simple interaction between the model display vehicle and the environment, the communication state can meet the basic requirements of the digital twin model because the amount of data to be transferred is small. This study makes a preliminary attempt at digital parallelism by combining mathematical logic with visualization models and can be used as a basis for the subsequent development of more mature digital twin models.

TI  - Refined Simulation Method for Computer-Aided Process Planning Based on Digital Twin Technology
T2  - MICROMACHINES
AB  - Simulation technology is widely used in computer-aided process planning (CAPP). The part machining process is simulated in the virtual world, which can predict manufacturing errors and optimize the process plan. Simulation accuracy is the guarantee of process decision-making and optimization. This article focuses on the use of digital twin technology to build a high-fidelity process model, taking the advantage of the integration of multiple systems, in order to achieve the dynamic association of real-time manufacturing data and process models. Making use of the CAPP/MES systems, the surface inspection data of the part is fed back to the CAPP system and associated with the digital twin process model. The wavelet transform method is used to reduce the noise of the high-frequency signal of the detection data, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated to verify the noise reduction effect. The surface topography, after noise reduction, was reconstructed in Matlab. On this basis, the Poisson reconstruction algorithm is used to reconstruct the high-fidelity process model for the refined simulation of the subsequent processes. Finally, by comparing the two sets of simulation experiments with the real machining results, we found that the simulation results, based on the digital twin model, are more accurate than the traditional simulation method by 58%.

TI  - Toward Digital Twin of Off-Road Vehicles Using Robot Simulation Frameworks
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Digital twins provide a powerful tool for testing and maintaining products and processes in several application fields, including manufacturing, smart cities, healthcare, and agriculture, aiming to optimize operational efficiency, resource usage, and planning accuracy. Research presented in this paper deals with the development of the digital version of off-road vehicles. Two different robot simulation frameworks are investigated. The first one is based on Gazebo, an open-source 3D robotics simulator, to test and validate the algorithms developed in the ROS framework; the second one adopts the vehicle mechanical assembly in MSC Adams, a multibody modeling software used to study the dynamics of complex mechanical systems. Both models are developed for a tracked robot that uses an innovative articulated passive suspension system on either side that allows each ground wheel to move independently with respect to the vehicle body, providing remarkable adaptability to irregular terrain. In addition, a Gazebo model is developed for a four-wheel drive/steering robot, including robot sensors such as GNSS, IMU, and visual sensors and a model of a typical agricultural environment (i.e., a vineyard). The paper presents the details of model design and implementation while investigating the best choice in developing the digital twin of off-road vehicles operating in the field. Additionally, an agricultural scenario has been selected as a use case to facilitate the evaluation of the analyzed frameworks. Our findings demonstrate that the Gazebo framework could serve as a suitable robot simulation framework for creating digital twins of vehicles, provided it incorporates real-time sensor measurements designed for identifying soil-wheel interaction dynamics. In contrast, the multibody model provides a higher-fidelity dynamic model, including track-terrain interaction. Despite its advantages, this model has substantially higher computational costs, which limits its applicability to real-time simulations, making it less feasible for practical use in the field.

TI  - Knowledge-based digital twin system: Using a knowlege-driven approach for manufacturing process modeling
T2  - COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY
AB  - The Knowledge-Based Digital Twin System is a digital twin system developed on the foundation of a knowledge graph, aimed at serving the complex manufacturing process. This system embraces a knowledge-driven modeling approach, aspiring to construct a digital twin model for the manufacturing process, thereby enabling precise description, management, prediction, and optimization of the process. The core of this system lies in the comprehensive knowledge graph that encapsulates all pertinent information about the manufacturing process, facilitating dynamic modeling and iteration through knowledge matching and inference within the knowledge, geometry, and decision model. This approach not only ensures consistency across models but also addresses the challenge of coupling multi-source heterogeneous information, creating a holistic and precise information model. As the manufacturing process deepens and knowledge accumulates, the model 's understanding of the process progressively enhances, promoting self-evolution and continuous optimization. The developed knowledgedecision-geometry model acts as the ontological layer within the digital twin framework, laying a foundational conceptual framework for the digital twin of the manufacturing process. Validated on an aero-engine blade production line in a factory, the results demonstrate that the knowledge model, as the core driver, enables continuous self-updating of the geometric model for an accurate depiction of the entire manufacturing process, while the decision model provides deep insights for decision-makers based on knowledge. The system not only effectively controls, predicts, and optimizes the manufacturing process but also continually evolves as the process advances. This research offers a new perspective on the realization of the digital twin for the manufacturing process, providing solid theoretical support with a knowledge-driven approach.

TI  - Design and Implementation of a Hierarchical Digital Twin for Power Systems Using Real-Time Simulation
T2  - ELECTRONICS
AB  - This paper presents a hierarchical Digital Twin architecture and implementation that uses real-time simulation to emulate the physical grid and support grid planning and operation. With the demand for detailed grid information for automated grid operations and the ongoing transformation of energy systems, the Digital Twin can extend data acquisition by establishing a reliable real-time simulation. The system uses observer algorithms to process model information about the voltage dependencies of grid nodes, providing information about the dynamic behavior of the grid. The architecture implements multiple layers of data monitoring, processing, and simulation to create node-specific Digital Twins that are integrated into a real-time Hardware-in-the-Loop setup. The paper includes a simulation study that validates the accuracy of the Digital Twin, in terms of steady-state conditions, dynamic behavior, and required processing time. The results show that the proposed architecture can replicate the physical grid with high accuracy and corresponding dynamic behavior.

TI  - Research into Dynamic Error Optimization Method of Impeller Blade Machining Based on Digital-Twin Technology
T2  - MACHINES
AB  - A TC4 impeller blade is a typical weak, rigid, thin-walled part. The contact area between a cutting tool and a workpiece has strong time-varying characteristics. This leads to a strong non-linear variation in cutting load. So, in this kind of part, the processing error is difficult to control. To solve this problem, a method of processing error prediction and intelligent controlling which considers the effect of tool wear time variation is proposed by combining digital-twinning technology. Firstly, an iterative model for digital-twin process optimization is constructed. Secondly, an iterative prediction model of the machining position following the milling force and considering the effect of tool wear is proposed. Based on these models, the machining error of the TC4 impeller blade under dynamic load is predicted. Dynamic machining error prediction and intelligent control are realized by combining the digital-twin model and the multi-objective process algorithm. Finally, the machining error optimization effect of the proposed digital-twin model is verified via a comparison experiment of impeller blade milling. In terms of the precision of milling force mapping, the average error after optimization is less than 8%. The maximum error is no more than 14%. In terms of the optimization effect, the average error of the optimized workpiece contour is reduced by about 20%. The peak contour error is reduced by approximately 35%.

TI  - Carbon peak control for achieving net-zero renewable-based smart cities: Digital twin modeling and simulation
T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS
AB  - The pressing challenge of mitigating carbon emissions towards achieving net-zero energy in smart cities, especially in the context of renewable energy integration, necessitates renewable energy integration in the smart energy management. This research focuses on harnessing renewable energy sources to curb emissions using advanced machine learning of Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Leveraging the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), an evolutionary algorithm, we tackled the complexities of smart city energy management and optimization. ACO, inspired by the collective behavior of ants, allowed us to navigate the intricate landscape of energy distribution, optimizing resources for maximum efficiency. Furthermore, this article develops Digital Twin technology as a practical solution for modeling and simulating smart city environments. By creating detailed digital replicas of urban systems, Digital Twin facilitated precise analysis and experimentation. Our study utilized these digital models as practical case studies, enabling us to simulate various scenarios and optimize energy usage effectively. The synergy of renewable energy integration, ACO-driven optimization, and Digital Twin modeling offers a holistic and intelligent approach to propel smart cities towards a sustainable, net-zero energy future.

TI  - Digital Twin-Assisted Cooperative Driving at Non-Signalized Intersections
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT VEHICLES
AB  - Digital Twin, as an emerging technology related to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT), has attracted increasing attentions during the past decade. Conceptually, a Digital Twin is a digital replica of a physical entity in the real world, and this technology is leveraged in this study to design a cooperative driving system at non-signalized intersections, allowing connected vehicles to cooperate with each other to cross intersections without any full stops. Within the proposed Digital Twin framework, we developed an enhanced first-in-first-out (FIFO) slot reservation algorithm to schedule the sequence of crossing vehicles, a consensus motion control algorithm to calculate vehicles' referenced longitudinal motion, and a model-based motion estimation algorithm to tackle communication delay and packet loss. Additionally, an augmented reality (AR) human-machine-interface (HMI) is designed to provide the guidance to drivers to cooperate with other connected vehicles. Agent-based modeling and simulation of the proposed system is conducted in Unity game engine based on a real-world map in San Francisco, and the human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation results prove the benefits of the proposed algorithms with 20% reduction in travel time and 23.7% reduction in energy consumption, respectively, when compared with traditional signalized intersections.

TI  - Reusing model validation methods for the continuous validation of digital twins of cyber-physical systems
T2  - SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS MODELING
AB  - One of the challenges in twinned systems is ensuring the digital twin remains a valid representation of the system it twins. Depending on the type of twinning occurring, it is either trivial, such as in dashboarding/visualizations that mirror the system with real-time data, or challenging, in case the digital twin is a simulation model that reflects the behavior of a physical twinned system. The challenge in this latter case comes from the fact that in contrast to software systems, physical systems are not immutable once deployed, but instead they evolve through processes like maintenance, wear and tear or user error. It is therefore important to detect when changes occur in the physical system to evolve the twin alongside it. We employ and reuse validation techniques from model-based design for this goal. Model validation is one of the steps used to gain trust in the representativeness of a simulation model. In this work, we provide two contributions: (i) We provide a generic approach that, through the use of validation metrics, is able to detect anomalies in twinned systems, and (ii) We demonstrate these techniques with the help of an academic yet industrially relevant case study of a gantry crane such as found in ports. Treating anomalies also means correcting the error in the digital twin, which we do with a parameter estimation based on the historical data.

TI  - Decentralized periodic event-triggered control for smart water distribution systems via digital twin approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBUST AND NONLINEAR CONTROL
AB  - Decentralized periodic event-triggered control can reduce the working time and data transmissions in the sensor nodes for feedback control loops, making it suitable for wireless networked control systems, especially those with large physical scales, such as smart water distribution systems. However, the design of this control approach requires accurate system model, which is normally difficult to obtain. In this work, we assume a digital twin of the original system can be obtained by some modeling and simulation tools, for example, Simscape in MATLAB/Simulink for water distribution systems, and thus present an event-triggered controller design approach. We first present the design of such an event-triggered controller for the digital twin; and then analyze the condition under which if both the original system and its digital twin can be satisfied, the same controller can work for the original system and some type of stability can be guaranteed at the same time. The proposed approach is applied in a smart water distribution system to show the feasibility.

TI  - Digital Twins: State-of-the-Art and Future Directions for Modeling and Simulation in Engineering Dynamics Applications
T2  - ASCE-ASME JOURNAL OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY IN ENGINEERING SYSTEMS PART B-MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - This paper presents a review of the state of the art for digital twins in the application domain of engineering dynamics. The focus on applications in dynamics is because: (i) they offer some of the most challenging aspects of creating an effective digital twin, and (ii) they are relevant to important industrial applications such as energy generation and transport systems. The history of the digital twin is discussed first, along with a review of the associated literature; the process of synthesizing a digital twin is then considered, including definition of the aims and objectives of the digital twin. An example of the asset management phase for a wind turbine is included in order to demonstrate how the synthesis process might be applied in practice. In order to illustrate modeling issues arising in the construction of a digital twin, a detailed case study is presented, based on a physical twin, which is a small-scale three-story structure. This case study shows the progression toward a digital twin highlighting key processes including system identification, data-augmented modeling, and verification and validation. Finally, a discussion of some open research problems and technological challenges is given, including workflow, joints, uncertainty management, and the quantification of trust. In a companion paper, as part of this special issue, a mathematical framework for digital twin applications is developed, and together the authors believe this represents a firm framework for developing digital twin applications in the area of engineering dynamics.

TI  - Urban Digital Twins for Smart Cities and Citizens: The Case Study of Herrenberg, Germany
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Cities are complex systems connected to economic, ecological, and demographic conditions and change. They are also characterized by diverging perceptions and interests of citizens and stakeholders. Thus, in the arena of urban planning, we are in need of approaches that are able to cope not only with urban complexity but also allow for participatory and collaborative processes to empower citizens. This to create democratic cities. Connected to the field of smart cities and citizens, we present in this paper, the prototype of an urban digital twin for the 30,000-people town of Herrenberg in Germany. Urban digital twins are sophisticated data models allowing for collaborative processes. The herein presented prototype comprises (1) a 3D model of the built environment, (2) a street network model using the theory and method of space syntax, (3) an urban mobility simulation, (4) a wind flow simulation, and (5) a number of empirical quantitative and qualitative data using volunteered geographic information (VGI). In addition, the urban digital twin was implemented in a visualization platform for virtual reality and was presented to the general public during diverse public participatory processes, as well as in the framework of the "Morgenstadt Werkstatt" (Tomorrow's Cities Workshop). The results of a survey indicated that this method and technology could significantly aid in participatory and collaborative processes. Further understanding of how urban digital twins support urban planners, urban designers, and the general public as a collaboration and communication tool and for decision support allows us to be more intentional when creating smart cities and sustainable cities with the help of digital twins. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the presented results and further research directions.

TI  - Defining a feature-level digital twin process model by extracting machining features from MBD models for intelligent process planning
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING
AB  - The booming development of emerging technologies and their integration in process planning provide new opportunities for solving the problems in traditional trial-and-error process planning. Combining digital twin with 3D computer vision, this paper defines a novel feature-level digital twin process model (FL-DTPM) by extracting machining features from model-based definition models. Firstly, a multi-dimensional FL-DTPM framework is defined by fusing on-site data, quality information, and process knowledge, where the synergistic mechanism of its virtual and physical processes is revealed. Then, 3D computer vision-enabled machining features extraction method is embedded into the FL-DTPM framework to support the reuse of process knowledge, which involves the procedures of data pre-processing, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed features extraction method is verified and the application of FL-DTPM in machining process is presented. Oriented to the impeller process planning, a prototype of FL-DTPM is constructed to explore the potential application scenarios of the proposed method in intelligent process planning, which could provide insights into the industrial implementation of FL-DTPM for aerospace manufacturing enterprises.

TI  - ROS-based architecture for fast digital twin development of smart manufacturing robotized systems
T2  - ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB  - In the current era of Industry 4.0, smart manufacturing systems seek to achieve a high level of flexibility and efficiency. This can be achieved by means of incorporating a high degree of automation and autonomous robotized systems along with efficient decision-making systems capable to reconfigure the system tasks in real-time according to the external demands and perturbations. For the fast development of the digital twins of manufacturing plants that include some robotic devices, it is advantageous to use discrete-event simulators, for production process modeling, and the existing virtual environments of the robots and automatic devices. This work proposes the design and construction of software architecture capable of integrating discrete-event process simulators with the well-known Robot Operating System (ROS) allowing easily interchange information between the factory components for fast digital twin development of robotized manufacturing systems. In addition, our proposal allows for a straightforward integration between the digital twin with an autonomous decision-making system. The proposed ROS-based architecture is tested using different discrete-event simulators and the free distribution ROS Melodic. Finally, we present an instance of software architecture for a typical complex case study of manufacturing plants and demonstrate its easy integration with an autonomous decision-making system.

TI  - Modeling and Simulation of a Digital Twin of a Production System for Industry 4.0 with Work-in-Process Synchronization
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - One of the main problems of modern manufacturing systems is the increasing complexity related to modern Industry 4.0 technologies that are fundamentally changing manufacturing and logistics processes and operations. Industry 4.0 includes, e.g., flexible automation and robotization, which make complex manufacturing systems difficult to analyze. Some modeling and simulation methods are being used to solve industrial problems and can serve as an interface between the production level and management level. The new trend of the Digital Twin, creating simulation models as similar as possible to the real system, and a Digital Twin framework for a manufacturing line from the automotive industry, was considered. Simulation models typically start from the empty state and some warmup time is required to achieve the stable state. The Key Performance Indicators were also analyzed for the stable state. However, there are many stochastic parameters such as machinery failures, human errors, quality issues, etc., that make the real processes differ from simulated processes, and cause the instability of production throughput and changes in the Work in Process. To analyze the Work in Process in the model, initialization of the model with proper production data is required, as the Digital Twin uses data synchronization with the production database. In this paper, the digital model of a human-robot-operated manufacturing system with Work-in-Process data synchronization is analyzed, and the results of the statistical analysis of simulation experiments are presented. The obtained results show high variability of finished production, which is related to system instability due to random failures, especially when the system starts from an empty state. However, an increase in initial Work in Process results in better efficiency and stability for the whole system. The DT simulation of the manufacturing system can be very helpful, as it becomes a repository of knowledge about the real system and enables the analysis of its dynamics. However, for proper functionality, the model should include information about the current WIP state, which enables the start of the simulation with exactly the same number of queues as in the real system. The presented method can also be used in similar enterprises from other industries, especially for those with discrete processes or high WIP variability, and for further synchronization of other DT parameters.

TI  - Digital-twin co-simulation framework to support informed decision in healthcare planning and management
T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
AB  - This manuscript aims to show the proof-of-concept for the integration of digital twin (DT) and discrete event co-simulation through its application to forward simulation of physical activities of care providers and robots in an intensive care unit (ICU). Co-simulation focuses on modular integration of heterogeneous simulation components to capture the complexity inherent in systems. Advancing this conception, the proposed co-simulation attempted to narrow gaps with real-world systems by using DT while simultaneously leveraging the forward simulation capacity of discrete event simulation (DES). In particular, we created a co-simulation for human-robot interactions in a simulated ICU facility, which modeled the hospital layout including the facility, robot, avatars for healthcare professionals, equipment, patient bed, and vital signs, which comprise physical twin (PT). In addition, specific patient-care scenarios were defined to drive PT for which the states of interest were represented in the DT, and then used for a dynamic input to the discrete event co-simulation. At the onset of the co-simulation, the parameters needed to run DES were manually configured to align the parameters with those of the DT. For internal validation, this DES was replicated under different work-system policies, and the co-simulation outcomes were interpreted in clinical context. Our co-simulation approach has potential for application to a broader class of problems in healthcare planning and management by supporting informed decision-making. Methodologically, timely information exchanges of PT with DT, and ensuing model updates in the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) is a promising approach for co-simulation, to maintain robustness against perturbations to real-world systems.

AB  - In the past decade, human digital twins (HDTs) attracted attention in both digital twin (DT) applications and beyond. In this paper, we discuss the concept and the development of HDTs, focusing on their architecture, key enabling technologies, and (potential) applications. Based on the literature, we identify personal data, model, and interface as three key modules in the proposed HDT architecture, supported by a data lake of human data and a model and interface library. Regarding the key enabling technologies that support the HDT functions, we envision that the internet of things (IoT) infrastructure, data security, wearables, human modeling, explainable artificial intelligence (AI), minimum viable sensing, and data visualization are closely associated with the development of HDTs. Finally, we investigate current applications of HDTs, with a particular emphasis on the opportunities that arise from leveraging HDTs in the field of personalized product design.

TI  - A Two-Phase Lifetime Prediction Model of Generator Stator Main Wall Insulation Driven by Digital Twin
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
AB  - Currently, most existing remaining useful life (RUL) prediction models for generators' main wall insulation (MI) focus on the statistical life distributions for a large population of products. The shortcoming of these models is that they cannot incorporate individual degradation information of a single product. To address the challenge of fusing common and individual degradation information, this article proposes a digital-twin-driven two-phase RUL prediction model, composing of three parts: common representation model (CRM), individual representation model (IRM), and dynamic evolution model. The proposed digital twin framework integrates the Wiener process model, Kalman filtering (KF) algorithm, and support vector machine (SVM) model. Specifically, a CRM based on the two-phase Wiener process was established to reflect common features. Then, with CRM acting as the state equation, an IRM was established based on KF, which can fuse MI's individual degradation information with common degradation information to reflect the individual features of single product. In addition, SVM is used to address the issue that the covariance matrix of KF algorithm cannot be updated in prediction domains of long-life products, achieving the dynamic evolution of the digital twin system. Finally, the effectiveness and engineering application value of the model were verified through experiments.

TI  - Digital twin for the formal analysis of a depth of anesthesia controller
T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Effective management of depth of anesthesia (DoA) is crucial for patient safety in healthcare. Anesthesiologists typically adjust anesthetic dosages to maintain desired sedation, analgesia (pain relief), and muscle relaxation states. In this paper, we present a digital twin (DT) architecture for the formal modeling and verification of an infusion pump controller for DoA management. The DT incorporates a virtual patient model, an autonomous DoA controller adjusting the infusion rate of the anesthetic agent, i.e., propofol, a test-case manager, and a runtime verification monitor. Data exchange occurs via Ethernet frames. Challenges arise from noise in the Bispectral Index monitoring system readings and infusion rate measurements in clinical scenarios. To mitigate noise impact, we design a feedback controller that is robust against noise. We reason about DT performance by evaluating control specifications using a temporal-logic language within the context of our runtime verification tool.

TI  - Digital Twin for Extraction Process Design and Operation
T2  - PROCESSES
AB  - Traditional extraction processes of natural product are widespread, especially in regulated industries. Possibilities of extraction development and manufacturing optimization in regulated industries is limited. Regulatory approvals are often based on traditional preparations of phyto-pharmaceuticals. The dependence on traditional processes can result in sub-optimal extraction parameters causing unnecessary costs and product variability. Innovative methods like Quality-by-Design (QbD), including process analytical technology (PAT), open opportunities for manufacturers to cope with regulatory demanded, narrow batch-to-batch variability. In addition, such validated process models represent perfect digital twins which could be utilized for advanced process control and life cycle analysis.

TI  - Cyber-resilience of Critical Cyber Infrastructures: Integrating digital twins in the electric power ecosystem
T2  - COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB  - This contribution presents a model for cyber-resilience of critical cyber infrastructures (CCI) based on the implementation of a digital twin. It addresses the risks associated with the in-tegration of computational, communication and physical aspects of CCIs. We focus specifi-cally on cybersecurity in the electric power sector due both to its salience and to the poten-tial risks associated to failures in guaranteeing resilience. Informed by the literature on in-formation security management, situational awareness (SA) and common operational pic-ture (COP), we derive an overarching model to provide CCIs' actors with increased cyber sit-uational awareness, common understanding of incidents and enhanced response capacity. On the practical side, the model seeks to minimize response time and to reduce the impact of cyber-attacks on the organizations and on society as a whole. We develop a process model and validate three design propositions through a formative evaluation in the context of a digital twin implementation in the EU electrical power sector. We discuss the implications of this model for further research as well as practical applications for the electrical power sector. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Intelligent overall planning model of underground space based on digital twin
T2  - COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Against the background of the rapid development of social economy and advanced industrial manufacturing, emerging technologies are sweeping the world. The overall planning of urban space is also gradually developing in the direction of "intelligence". The real estate market has been booming in recent years. As a result, the available land resources on the surface are declining. It first gives a general introduction to the digital twin technology and operating rules, and then introduces the analytic hierarchy process and the complexity evolution process model for specific analysis. It first determines the relative weight vector, and then verifies the consis-tency of the judgment matrix to obtain the simulated probability density function. For the calculation of underground space safety accident risk assessment, the Bayesian network is used for evaluation. This facilitates disaster warnings of possible and ongoing accidents and reduces the adverse consequences of accidents. Then, the digital twin technology is applied to the analysis of underground space visualization, underground construction and underground disaster pre-vention monitoring. During the construction stage, the bottom of the upper structure column has changed a lot. The difference between the difference between the foundation difference between the adjacent color spectrum column of the upper structure is relatively mild. When digging a large area of ground soil, the foundation dropped to 5.6 mm. When the soil on the side of the pile was removed, the ground building was basically settle down, 0.8 mm. When the structure of the pile side soil is completed, it indicates that the technology of the pile foundation base of the surface building is basically. Finish. Subsequent sidewalk soil has almost no effect on the upper structure. At this stage, the final deposition difference is 2.427 mm, which meets the requirements of the neighboring column base in the current regulations. Finally, I studied the prevention of disaster prevention in the underground space, simulated the accident scene, and obtained the most suitable imaging equipment for the monitoring of disaster. After the prevention of disaster testing and simulation accidents for underground space, the most suitable imaging equipment for pre-venting disaster testing was obtained. Its formal digital twin technology.

TI  - Identification of a Practical Digital Twin for Simulation of Machine Tools
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB  - A practical digital twin for machine tools is proposed in this study. The proposed digital twin is capable of time-domain simulation of machine tools and consists of a controller model, machining process model, and machine dynamic model. To predict the quality of the machined surface after the finishing processes, a precise dynamic model is required. The developed dynamic model consists of an interaction force model, vibration model, and friction force model. A linear auto regressive with exogenous inputs (ARX) model is adopted for the interaction and vibration models. Based on a systematic analysis of the disturbance forces of the machine tool, the friction characteristics are extracted to a displacement-dependent friction model and velocity-dependent friction model. A nonlinear Hammerstein model is adopted to identify the friction. Online identification systems based on the recursive least-squares (RLS) method are developed and tested for each model.

TI  - Application Status and Prospect of Digital Twin for On-Orbit Spacecraft
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - With cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence and other new information technologies going into space, the era of space intelligence is coming. The spacecraft is facing more frequent and multi-task tests in an unprecedented complex environment, which set higher requirements for self-management. The current challenge lies in how to further build an integrated system of the virtual and physical space for spacecraft. In this tendency, the integration of Digital twin(DT) with spacecraft is also in its evolutionary trend. DT provides a data and model-based systematic approach for operation and management in the entire service life of on-orbit spacecraft. In this context, as a basic space system entity, the method of constructing DT of spacecraft is explored in this paper. Firstly, the concept of Spacecraft Digital twin (SDT) is put forward and four stages of simulation development are discussed from the perspective of DT. Moreover, the conceptual structure of four-dimensional model is proposed to adapt spatial distribution. After that, the key problems of SDT are discussed, including data acquisition, system configuration, and data service model. Accordingly, the future intelligent applications of spacecraft based on DT in autonomous cognition, autonomous operation and maintenance, as well as cluster collaboration are presented respectively.

TI  - Digital Twin Concepts with Uncertainty for Nuclear Power Applications
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - Digital Twins (DTs) are receiving considerable attention from multiple disciplines. Much of the literature at this time is dedicated to the conceptualization of digital twins, and associated enabling technologies and challenges. In this paper, we consider these propositions for the specific application of nuclear power. Our review finds that the current DT concepts are amenable to nuclear power systems, but benefit from some modifications and enhancements. Further, some areas of the existing modeling and simulation infrastructure around nuclear power systems are adaptable to DT development, while more recent efforts in advanced modeling and simulation are less suitable at this time. For nuclear power applications, DT development should rely first on mechanistic model-based methods to leverage the extensive experience and understanding of these systems. Model-free techniques can then be adopted to selectively, and correctively, augment limitations in the model-based approaches. Challenges to the realization of a DT are also discussed, with some being unique to nuclear engineering, however most are broader. A challenging aspect we discuss in detail for DTs is the incorporation of uncertainty quantification (UQ). Forward UQ enables the propagation of uncertainty from the digital representations to predict behavior of the physical asset. Similarly, inverse UQ allows for the incorporation of data from new measurements obtained from the physical asset back into the DT. Optimization under uncertainty facilitates decision support through the formal methods of optimal experimental design and design optimization that maximize information gain, or performance, of the physical asset in an uncertain environment.

TI  - Integrated Digital Twins System for Oil Temperature Prediction of Power Transformer Based on Internet of Things
T2  - IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB  - Oil temperature is an important index to reflect the state of transformer and predict the fault and remaining useful life of transformer. However, the oil temperature of the transformer is affected by various factors, such as weather conditions, load changes, holidays, seasons, and so on. In order to predict oil temperature more accurately, this study proposes a VCEEMDAN data decomposition algorithm to extract the characteristics of oil temperature data. And we proposed a hybrid long-term series forecasting model of oil temperature based on VCEEMDAN, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Informer. At the same time, the digital twins system of the manipulator is configured to assist personnel in maintenance when the oil temperature is abnormal. And the digital twins system of an oil-immersed power transformer to monitoring of transformer status. Finally, the above research is integrated into a digital twins system, including transformer condition monitoring, oil temperature prediction, and intelligent maintenance based on Internet of Things (IOT). The proposed prediction method was compared with the six existing models on three datasets. From the experimental results, the best index improvement is 77.97% higher than the second-best model. And the simulation system can provide a good reference for the practical application of the factory. This article presents a hybrid framework that achieves a accurate transformer oil temperature prediction.

TI  - AI-driven digital twin for autonomous web tension control in Roll-to-Roll manufacturing system
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - While the roll-to-roll manufacturing process plays a key role in high-throughput and cost-effective production, precise web tension control remains a critical challenge due to the dynamic interaction of web materials and roller mechanics. To address these challenges, this study proposes an AI-driven digital twin framework for autonomous web tension control optimization. The proposed method integrates Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process modeling to efficiently explore and adjust proportional and integral control parameters. While the operation of the roll-to-roll system is managed through a real-time client-server communication, system responses are designed to be iteratively refined by the proposed surrogate model. Experimental validation on an actual roll-to-roll manufacturing system demonstrates that the optimized control strategy significantly reduces tension variation and improves system stability. The proposed method highlights the potential of AI-integrated digital twins in autonomous manufacturing, which can offer a scalable solution for a variety of industrial applications.

TI  - Advanced fire emergency management based on potential fire risk assessment with informative digital twins
T2  - AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION
AB  - Modern large complex buildings, with their vast expanses and multipurpose usability, present diverse fire- spread scenarios, necessitating precise awareness of fire situations. Despite numerous studies integrating building information models with IoT and AI technologies to provide contextual information, there may be limitations in recognizing potential risks under dynamic fire behaviors during urgent situations. This paper presents a fire emergency management system based on an informative digital twin (IDT) to provide instantaneous fire situational information. Utilizing IDT, the system gathers building-specific fire scenario knowledge for immediate fire recognition. Leveraging this knowledge, the IDT assesses building fire risks and shares safety information on egress routes and zones with fire-related applications. A simulation case study revealed a fire recognition processing time of 0.88 s, acceptable for fire emergencies. Additionally, the IDT's risk assessment reduced the total evacuation time by 65 s and potential injuries by 406, demonstrating the system's effectiveness in fire emergency management.

TI  - Revisiting digital twins: Origins, fundamentals, and practices
T2  - FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
AB  - The digital twins (DT) has quickly become a hot topic since it was proposed. It appears in all kinds of commercial propaganda and is widely quoted by academic circles. However, the term DT has misstatements and is misused in business and academics. This study revisits DT and defines it to be a more advanced system/product/service modeling and simulation environment that combines most modern information communication technologies (ICTs) and engineering mechanism digitization and characterized by system/product/service life cycle management, physically geometric visualization, real-time sensing and measurement of system operating conditions, predictability of system performance/safety/lifespan, and complete engineering mechanisms-based simulations. The idea of DT originates from modeling and simulation practices of engineering informatization, including virtual manufacturing (VM), model predictive control, and building information modeling (BIM). On the basis of the two-element VM model, we propose a three-element model to represent DT. DT does not have its unique technical characteristics. The existing practices of DT are extensions of the engineering informatization embracing modern ICTs. These insights clarify the origin of DT and its technical essentials.

AB  - As the take-off of China's macro economy, as well as the rapid development of infrastructure construction, real estate industry, and highway logistics transportation industry, the demand for heavy vehicles is increasing rapidly, the competition is becoming increasingly fierce, and the digital transformation of the production line is imminent. As one of the most important components of heavy vehicles, the transmission front and middle case assembly lines have a high degree of automation, which can be used as a pilot for the digital transformation of production. To ensure the visualization of digital twins (DT), consistent control logic, and real-time data interaction, this paper proposes an experimental digital twin modeling method for the transmission front and middle case assembly line. Firstly, the DT-based system architecture is designed, and the DT model is created by constructing the visualization model, logic model, and data model of the assembly line. Then, a simulation experiment is carried out in a virtual space to analyze the existing problems in the current assembly line. Eventually, some improvement strategies are proposed and the effectiveness is verified by a new simulation experiment.

TI  - Development of a System Dynamics Simulation for Assessing Manufacturing Systems Based on the Digital Twin Concept
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Featured Application Modeling and simulation of manufacturing systems for their management and control, considering all the related areas, flows, and factors, in digital twin models for optimized regulation of process stability and quality with maintenance strategies for future industrial service-related business models. Historically, manufacturing system researchers and managers have often failed to consider all the areas, factors, and implications of a process within an integrated manufacturing model. Thus, the aim of this research was to develop an integral modeling approach for manufacturing processes in order to assess their status and performance. For this purpose, a novel conceptual model consisting of an integral definition of areas and flows is applied. As a result, manufacturing systems can be modeled, considering all related flows and decision-making options in the respective areas of production, maintenance, and quality. As a result, these models serve as the basis for the integral management and control of manufacturing systems in digital twin models for the regulation of process stability and quality with maintenance strategies. Thus, a system dynamics simulation model is developed for a metallurgical process. The goal of the simulation model is to provide a digital manufacturing system regulated with different maintenance, quality, and production strategies in order to secure quality and delivery service. The results show how the monitoring of all flows together with the optimal strategies in the quality and maintenance areas as a result of a regulated system can enable companies to increase their profitability and customer service level. In conclusion, the applied simulation case study allows better decision making, ensuring continuous optimization along the manufacturing asset lifecycle and providing a unique selling proposition for equipment producers and service engineering suppliers, as well as for production and assembly companies.

TI  - Feature-based modeling for industrial processes in the context of digital twins: A case study of HVOF process
T2  - ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS
AB  - Industrial process modeling is currently undergoing a fundamental transformation, leading towards interconnected close-loop twins of models, i.e., the parametrically-controlled real-world physics model, and its corresponding digitalized virtual system model. Between these models, a highly time-sensitive mutual validation mechanism and a coherent and consistent control strategy are applied, which demand complex virtual-and-real world model-based information mapping and synchronization. Thus, this research proposes a semantic conceptual framework for industrial process modeling in the context of digital twins. Based on a hierarchical structure of digital twins, this framework modularizes the modeling process in terms of the semantic information modules of physics in the real-world phenomena, and clarifies inter-module associations and near-real-time data transmission coupled with virtual analysis in CAE environment so that the time-sensitive phenomenon information objects distributed on virtually-separated sub-level physics models can be supported for representing the real-world process comprehensively. Advanced feature concept is adopted to construct the digital models as the basic compositions of any virtual industrial process. The related feature definitions are extended in this work so that the common characteristics in the concept of digital twins could be generically and concisely represented. To validate the modeling method, the digital model of a prototyped High-velocity Oxygen-fuel (HVOF) coating process system was constructed as the case study. The data from the nozzle trajectory, the flame, and the in-flight particle behavior, and the transient thermal performance of the coating layer and substrate were synchronously incorporated for simulating the transient phenomena of the substrate component temperature and coating thickness distribution on the substrate surface. The final simulation result validates that the feature-based digital model is able to comprehensively reflect the real-world scenario on the virtual side. To illustrate how the developed model provides meaningful feedback to the real-world control, a general digital twin setup of the model is given at the end of the case study.

TI  - Digital twin-driven assembly accuracy prediction method for high performance precision assembly of complex products
T2  - ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS
AB  - The high performance precision assembly (HPPA) of complex products such as aerospace, aircraft and high-end machine tool has demanding requirements for assembly accuracy. Achieving the accurate prediction of assembly accuracy for these complex products before assembling is the premise of improving the assembly quality and performance, and also has always been a challenge. Existing assembly accuracy prediction methods focus on acquiring the assembly deviation based on CAD model and manufacturing errors of parts, but rarely involve the multidimensional error coupling of parts and the influencing factors in the assembly process, which inevitably cause a certain gap between the prediction result and the actual condition, affecting the reliability of the prediction result. To address the above problems, this paper presents a digital twin (DT)-driven assembly accuracy prediction method for the HPPA of complex products. Firstly, this paper introduces the methodology overview and proposes an overall framework for DT-driven assembly accuracy prediction. Secondly, three key enabling technologies realizing the DT-driven assembly accuracy prediction, including the construction of part digital twin model, the generation of DT-based assembly process model, and assembly deviation propagation and accuracy analysis are introduced in detail. Finally, an application implementation of a prototype system and a case study involving a simplified satellite structure panel assembly process are used to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.

AB  - Digital twin development of industrial cyber-physical systems requires modeling, simulation, and monitoring to provide accurate digital replicas mimicking system dynamics. To this aim, modern solutions employ data-driven approaches to capture normal system dynamics using historical data, and anomaly detection using run-time data. However, these approaches are typically process-agnostic and have limited explainability, which negatively impacts trustworthiness. Hence, we propose a novel framework for the digital twin development of industrial cyber-physical systems based on process mining, which connects data-driven and process-based analyses. The framework implements an offline phase that systematically identifies the most suitable process model to capture normal dynamics and simulates faulty dynamics for what-if analysis. The subsequent online phase involves run-time monitoring for anomaly detection. We develop a proof-of-concept application of the framework addressing a water distribution case study that allows physical fault injection. Results highlight the importance of adopting high-quality process models to significantly improve anomaly detection and time performance.

TI  - The Modeling and Using Strategy for the Digital Twin in Process Planning
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Process planning is the core of guiding process production and one of the most critical parts to realize intelligent manufacturing of products. In order to realize the monitoring, simulation, prediction and control of the physical space in the intelligent manufacturing mode, the digital twin technology is used to guide the process planning. This research describes a modeling method of digital twin process model (DTPM) for manufacturing process and the contents of DT data, discusses the acquisition method of real-time data and the management method of simulation data. Aiming at the data fusion between physical space and virtual space, a hierarchical model and mapping strategy for multi-source heterogeneous data in machining process are proposed to generate the DT data. Finally, the guidance and the visualization function in process planning of DTPM is analyzed, and the effectiveness of this method is verified by choosing the design process of a key component in a marine diesel engine.

TI  - A mesoscopic digital twin that bridges length and time scales for control of additively manufactured metal microstructures
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-MATERIALS
AB  - We present our recent development of an integrated mesoscale digital twin (DT) framework for relating processing conditions, microstructures, and mechanical responses of additively manufactured (AM) metals. In particular, focusing on the laser powder bed fusion technique, we describe how individual modeling and simulation capabilities are coupled to investigate and control AM microstructural features at multiple length and time scales. We review our prior case studies that demonstrate the integrated modeling schemes, in which high-fidelity melt pool dynamics simulations provide accurate local thermal profiles and histories to subsequent AM microstructure simulations. We also report our new mechanical response modeling results for predicted AM microstructures. In addition, we illustrate how our DT framework has been validated through modeling-experiment integration, as well as how it has been practically utilized to guide and analyze AM experiments. Finally, we share our perspectives on future directions of further development of the DT framework for more efficient, accurate predictions and wider ranges of applications.

TI  - Harnessing digital twins and industrial-IoT for cutting-edge mining automation: A methodological and technology assessment prototype
T2  - COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB  - The projection indicates that by 2025, more than 41.6 billion IoT devices will be active, generating a staggering 80 zettabytes (ZB) of data collectively. Despite the widespread integration of smart devices across various sectors like smart homes, wearable's, smart cities, and workplaces, the mining industry has been comparatively slow in adopting innovative technologies. However, it is essential to recognize the vital role played by the mining sector in powering energy systems, manufacturing components for smart devices, and employing over 4.5 million individuals globally, often in demanding and harsh conditions. This paper presents a prototype Industrial IoT and Digital Twin platform to optimize industrial automation in traditional mining operations. Moreover, it proposes a digital twin reference architecture employing Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) and simulation techniques to validate the reference architecture within a mining context. The results indicate an impressive 98% accuracy achieved within a time frame of 10.25 s.

TI  - Digital Twins and Their Role in Model-Assisted Design of Experiments
T2  - DIGITAL TWINS: APPLICATIONS TO THE DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION OF BIOPROCESSES
AB  - Rising demands for biopharmaceuticals and the need to reduce manufacturing costs increase the pressure to develop productive and efficient bioprocesses. Among others, a major hurdle during process development and optimization studies is the huge experimental effort in conventional design of experiments (DoE) methods. As being an explorative approach, DoE requires extensive expert knowledge about the investigated factors and their boundary values and often leads to multiple rounds of time-consuming and costly experiments. The combination of DoE with a virtual representation of the bioprocess, called digital twin, in model-assisted DoE (mDoE) can be used as an alternative to decrease the number of experiments significantly. mDoE enables a knowledge-driven bioprocess development including the definition of a mathematical process model in the early development stages. In this chapter, digital twins and their role in mDoE are discussed. First, statistical DoE methods are introduced as the basis of mDoE. Second, the combination of a mathematical process model and DoE into mDoE is examined. This includes mathematical model structures and a selection scheme for the choice of DoE designs. Finally, the application of mDoE is discussed in a case study for the medium optimization in an antibody-producing Chinese hamster ovary cell culture process.

TI  - Systematic Digital Twin-Based Development Approach for Holistic Sustainable Electric Traction Motors
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Sustainability is a key challenge today. The high emission impact of the mobility sector requires a shift from internal combustion engines to electric traction motors. In order to improve sustainability holistically, the entire lifecycle from raw materials, manufacturing, use and end-of-life must be considered during development. Although a lot can be carried out to influence sustainability during the development phase, knowledge about the product is still very limited. Considering the main lifecycle stages already during the development phase requires a systematic development approach. Furthermore, integrating data from previous product generations is required. Generating a digital twin which collects data over the lifecycle is a useful tool which enables the prediction of evaluation criteria for the lifecycle stages. However, when using the digital twin, a suitable description model needs to be generated. A cross-lifecycle evaluation model based on Life Cycle Costing (LCC) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was used to evaluate sustainability throughout the whole lifecycle. Information for evaluation was generated using a cross-lifecycle modeling approach, which enabled the combination of different lifecycle perspectives during development. To show the potential of evaluating different solutions from different perspectives, the methodology was demonstrated with a lightweight rotor of an electric traction motor. The great potential of the process model is shown.

TI  - On a Multiphysics Digital Twin for Aging Prediction of Adhesive Step Lap Joints
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING
AB  - The present work describes the early steps in creating a digital twin to predict aging for multi-material adhesive step lap joints (ASLJs), considering simultaneous mechanical and environmental influences. It begins by defining the digital twin context and its specific architecture known as the data-driven digital twin (D3T). For a D3T to work, a theoretical and computational framework must be established to understand how the properties of materials in ASLJs degrade due to environmental damage. The developed framework describes a thermodynamics-based theory for predicting material degradation. The computational implementation of the framework and its performance are evaluated using two models of multi-material ASLJs. The first model contains a single-step ASLJ made of titanium Ti-6Al-4V and carbon epoxy composite with FM-300K adhesive, featuring three variations to show different levels of homogenization. Studies on this model assess the impact of various parameters such as the finite element order, mesh density, damage parameters, and inclusion of damage models for the participating domains. The validation of this model is also provided against experimental data. The second model addresses a multistep ASLJ using the same materials. Predictions from this model are compared favorably with experimental results under two different environmental conditions to gain insights into the aging and performance degradation of the ASLJs. Finally, conclusions and plans close the present paper.

TI  - From modeling and simulation to Digital Twin: evolution or revolution?
T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
AB  - As digitalization is permeating all sectors of society toward the concept of "smart everything," and virtual technologies and data are gaining a dominant place in the engineering and control of intelligent systems, the Digital Twin (DT) concept has surfaced as one of the top technologies to adopt. This paper discusses the DT concept from the viewpoint of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) experts. It both provides literature review elements and adopts a commentary-driven approach. We first examine the DT from a historical perspective, tracing the historical development of M&S from its roots in computational experiments to its applications in various fields and the birth of DT-related and allied concepts. We then approach DTs as an evolution of M&S, acknowledging the overlap in these different concepts. We also look at the M&S workflow and its evolution toward a DT workflow from a software engineering perspective, highlighting significant changes. Finally, we look at new challenges and requirements DTs entail, potentially leading to a revolutionary shift in M&S practices. In this way, we hope to foster the discussion on DTs and provide the M&S expert with innovative perspectives.

TI  - Real-Time Cyber-Physical Digital Twin for Low Earth Orbit Satellite Constellation Network Enhanced Wide-Area Power Grid
T2  - IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY
AB  - Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks, such as SpaceX's Starlink, offer enhanced communication potential for contemporary power grid measurement and control. Yet, the dynamic nature of these networks complicates their modeling and simulation. This study introduces a modular, data-oriented digital twin framework for real-time simulation of wide-area ac-dc grids with LEO satellite networks. The framework integrates RustSat for satellite tracking, SatSDN with MiniNet for SDN simulations, and entity-component-system (ECS)-Grid for real-time power system simulation. It features a data-centric design using an ECS framework with a structure-of-arrays memory layout, optimizing cache efficiency and computational performance, and offers high extensibility for interdisciplinary simulations. This marks the initial effort to develop a digital twin for real-time co-simulation of large-scale power systems and LEO satellite constellation networks. Evaluations on a wide-area synthetic ac-dc system with multiple satellite network types confirm the efficiency and precision of our approach, underscoring its potential in bridging LEO satellite networks with power system applications.

TI  - Industrial Digital Twins based on the non-linear LATIN-PGD
T2  - ADVANCED MODELING AND SIMULATION IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB  - Digital Twins, which tend to intervene over the entire life cycle of products from early design phase to predictive maintenance through optimization processes, are increasingly emerging as an essential component in the future of industries. To reduce the computational time reduced-order modeling (ROM) methods can be useful. However, the spread of ROM methods at an industrial level is currently hampered by the difficulty of introducing them into commercial finite element software, due to the strong intrusiveness of the associated algorithms, preventing from getting robust and reliable tools all integrated in a certified product. This work tries to circumvent this issue by introducing a weakly-invasive reformulation of the LATIN-PGD method which is intended to be directly embedded into Simcenter SamcefTM finite element software. The originality of this approach lies in the remarkably general way of doing, allowing PGD method to deal with not only a particular application but with all facilities already included in such softwares-any non-linearities, any element types, any boundary conditions...-and thus providing a new high-performance all-inclusive non-linear solver.

TI  - A digital twin-based smart assembly for cable-driven parallel robots
T2  - ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS
AB  - With the rapid development of advanced enabling technologies such as cloud computing, large language models, big data, and digital twin (DT), smart assembly has emerged as a central focus within smart manufacturing research. Robots, serving as indispensable execution units in this domain, have traditionally been implemented in serial or rigid parallel configurations. However, these robots typically encounter challenges such as limited load capacity, insufficient rigidity, and complex singularities. Although DT technology has been increasingly applied to robot modeling and simulation, current research falls short in addressing coordinating dynamic assembly processes and ensuring digital-physical synchronization. This gap fails to fully meet the demands of complex assembly tasks. To address these challenges, this study investigates cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs) with a large workspace, high load capacity, and strong dynamic performance. A DT-based smart assembly application framework for CDPRs is proposed, and four key technologies are explored in depth: (1) cable-driven parallel robots assembly process digital twin (CAPDT) model construction; (2) task-level assembly planning; (3) adaptive assembly instruction generation; and (4) CAPDT model consistency retention. These technologies collectively support assembly task planning, simulation verification, performance control, and process management. Finally, a simplified satellite assembly task is presented as a case study, and a DT-based CDPR assembly prototype system for is developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed application framework and technologies.

TI  - Product-part level digital twin modeling method for digital thread framework
T2  - COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Digital twin (DT) is not only a core technology of smart manufacturing but also a dynamic intelligent system. By organically combining virtual and realistic models with multiple data sources, DT is used in monitoring product operation status and in predicting product life. A systematic modeling method with high fidelity, punctuality, and efficiency has an important meaning to DT model. However, most of the current DT modeling approaches focus on individual objects and individual aspects of products, and lack of modeling approaches for the whole life cycle and multiple objects, which is not conducive to the mining and utilization of data from all aspects of products. On account of this, a part-level DT modeling approach is proposed based on PLM/PDM theory, integrating the property model, the process model, the simulation model, and the feedback model within a digital thread communication framework, with their modeling methods and application algorithms investigated separately. The results of the Part Digital Twin Model (PDTM) are presented by virtue of a visualization platform. There is interaction among customers, designers, and processors throughout the entire system, ensuring real-time monitoring of product manufacturing process. Finally, a test case of hanging axle is implemented, aiming at validating the proposed part-level DT modeling method. According to the result of this case, the proposed method in this paper can be used in generating the property of hanging axle, and giving real-time monitoring to the whole lifecycle of hanging axle, thereby demonstrating its feasibility.

TI  - Toward digital twins for intelligence manufacturing: Self-adaptive control in assisted equipment through multi-sensor fusion smart tool real-time machine condition monitoring
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS
AB  - Compared to traditional monitoring methods, multi-sensor fusion smart tool offers several advantages, including full-process monitoring and a broader range of applications (e.g., flat, curved, and complex surfaces). When integrated with artificial intelligence models for tool state monitoring, these tools provide strong generalization capabilities and high prediction accuracy. They can also adjust machine tool process parameters to extend tool life. However, the quasi-in-situ regulation of cutting parameters has a limited scope, making it challenging to achieve full working condition adaptability. The introduction of assisted equipment can enhance process adaptability. Furthermore, adaptive control mechanisms can regulate the machining process to reduce energy consumption by adjusting the opening and closing parameters. Despite these advantages, the linkage control mechanism for the smart tool remains unclear, and existing tool wear models struggle to adapt to variable working conditions across multiple scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper explores the digital twin modeling and application of smart tool machining processes. First, a digital twin-driven tool machining process model is developed, with an exploration of specific application scenarios and methods. Secondly, an adaptive coupling mechanism for assisted equipment based on digital twins is established, which simultaneously improves machining quality and reduces energy consumption. Additionally, the online tool wear identification model is enhanced to increase its generalization and reduce the cost of model reconstruction when working conditions change, thus enabling green intelligent manufacturing under high-quality machining conditions.

AB  - Today, modeling and simulation are used in the development of products and the engineering of machines and plants. Due to the structure of the considered systems and the distributed work, often single simulation models are created, which have to be combined for many applications. Co-simulation represents a simulation-technical solution. With the increasing use of simulation in operation and service, there is an additional need for powerful co-simulation techniques to realize cooperative digital twins. This article gives an overview of existing implementations with the focus on virtual commissioning of the automation system.

TI  - Digital Twin for Lyophilization by Process Modeling in Manufacturing of Biologics
T2  - PROCESSES
AB  - Lyophilization stabilizes formulated biologics for storage, transport and application to patients. In process design and operation it is the link between downstream processing and with final formulation to fill and finish. Recent activities in Quality by Design (QbD) have resulted in approaches by regulatory authorities and the need to include Process Analytical Technology (PAT) tools. An approach is outlined to validate a predictive physical-chemical (rigorous) lyophilization process model to act quantitatively as a digital twin in order to allow accelerated process design by modeling and to further-on develop autonomous process optimization and control towards real time release testing. Antibody manufacturing is chosen as a typical example for actual biologics needs. Literature is reviewed and the presented procedure is exemplified to quantitatively and consistently validate the physical-chemical process model with aid of an experimental statistical DOE (design of experiments) in pilot scale.

TI  - An application-time-window based credibility assessment method for equipment digital twins in manufacturing
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION INTEGRATION
AB  - To effectively assess the credibility of equipment digital twins (DT) for manufacturing, a new method fully considering the dynamic evolution process is urgently needed. In this paper, the influence of the evolution process on the applications is scrutinized, the connotation of equipment DT credibility assessment is expanded, and an assessment method to evaluate the general evolution process of equipment DTs in manufacturing is proposed. The method obtains the application-time-window (ATW) by fitting a joint probability distribution based on observation of actual application time points. Then the method uses the probability of application occurrence as a weight to quantitatively assess the model performance throughout the evolution process. The effectiveness of the method was validated by ablation experiments in manufacturing simulation scenes of workpieces transferring with robotic arms. Compared with existing assessment methods, the error of quantified DT credibility value is reduced by at least 65% and the assessment result can be obtained once the evolution is completed.

TI  - A Digital Twin for Automated Layup of Prepreg Composite Sheets
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB  - The composite sheet layup process involves stacking several layers of a viscoelastic prepreg sheet and curing the laminate to manufacture the component. Demands for automating functional tasks in the composite manufacturing processes have dramatically increased in the past decade. A simulation system representing a digital twin of the composite sheet can aid in the development of such an autonomous system for prepreg sheet layup. While finite element analysis (FEA) is a popular approach for simulating flexible materials, material properties need to be encoded to produce high-fidelity mechanical simulations. We present a methodology to predict material parameters of a thin-shell FEA model based on real-world observations of the deformations of the object. We utilize the model to develop a digital twin of a composite sheet. The method is tested on viscoelastic composite prepreg sheets and fabric materials such as cotton cloth, felt, and canvas. We discuss the implementation and development of a high-speed FEA simulator based on the VegaFEM library. By using our method to identify sheet material parameters, the sheet simulation system is able to predict sheet behavior within 5 cm of average error and have proven its capability for 10 fps real-time sheet simulation.

Thus, the article argues that wind and other fluids are moved as software and data in the logistical circuit that underpins design and digital twinning. However, this take on logistics of wind emerges at the back of a longer history of visual cultures of wind-including such takes as Harun Farocki's Parallel video essay on computer graphics and software modeling of elemental media-while focusing more on the past decades of software plug-ins as well as game engines. Digital twinning is contextualized in broader software cultures and logistics of environmental data.

TI  - A Digital Twin for Unconventional Reservoirs: A Multiscale Modeling and Algorithm to Investigate Complex Mechanisms
T2  - GEOFLUIDS
AB  - The special mechanisms underneath the flow and transport behaviors in unconventional reservoirs are still challenging an accurate and reliable production estimation. As an emerging approach in intelligent manufacturing, the concept of digital twin has attracted increasing attentions due to its capability of monitoring engineering processes based on modeling and simulation in digital space. The application potential is highly expected especially for problems with complex mechanisms and high data dimensions, because the utilized platform in the digital twin can be easily extended to cover more mechanisms and solve highly complicated problems with strong nonlinearity compared with experimental studies in physical space. In this paper, a digital twin is designed to numerically model the representative mechanisms that affect the production unconventional reservoirs, such as capillarity, dynamic sorption, and injection salinity, and it incorporates multiscale algorithms to simulate and illustrate the effect of these mechanisms on flow and transport phenomena. The preservation of physical laws among different scales is always the first priority, and simulation results are analyzed to verify the robustness of proposed multiscale algorithms.

TI  - Reliability optimization through soft digital twins
T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
AB  - This paper presents a framework for developing a "soft digital twin" (SDT) for reliability optimization through modeling and simulation. The focus is on demonstrating the effectiveness of the SDT in modeling maintenance task processes within mission-critical facilities, which is particularly essential for reliable operations in critical infrastructure such as nuclear facilities. The need for efficient completion of maintenance tasks (MTs) to ensure high reliability and minimal downtime underscores the challenge faced by managers, who desire a predictive tool akin to a "crystal ball" for optimal resource configuration in the face of uncertainties from equipment failures, staffing issues, and supply chain disruptions. The proposed SDT functions as this predictive tool, leveraging the simulation's versatility to provide insights into resource configurations and staff planning. This work extends the prior research by incorporating additional model validation, sensitivity testing, and analysis of the impact of various resource changes on the system. It employs a combination of data-driven frameworks and stochastic modeling methods to construct an adaptive SDT capable of accommodating changes in system behavior. The work provides a framework for the construction of SDT, testing and validation of its results, and its application to a case study of a mission-critical facility focused on replication and then optimizing of two key performance indicators based on human resource mixtures. Initial findings suggest that the SDT yields reliable results comparable to retrospective test datasets, offering the potential to minimize MTs' time in the system while maximizing throughput within specified time frames through scenario experimentation and optimization.

TI  - Application of Three-Flow Fusion Technology Based on Modelica in Thermal Power Digital Twin
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION
AB  - Thermal power plants gather large energy infrastructure; therefore, massive historical and real-time data of equipment operation will be generated in daily operation. Digital industrialization puts forward higher requirements for the use of big data than simple tasks, such as generating reports. MWorks is a multidomain unified modeling and simulation platform based on the Modelica language. In this study, MWorks is used to realize the modeling of multidomain systems, including electrical, thermal, mechanical, fluid, and heat transfer, in power plants. The test, calibration, verification, parameter optimization, and fault diagnosis of the thermal power plant mathematical models, which are historical and real-time data-driven, are discussed. The technology of three-flow fusion, including material flow, energy flow, and information flow, and its application in thermal power digital twin are explored.

TI  - Towards Autonomous Process Control-Digital Twin for CHO Cell-Based Antibody Manufacturing Using a Dynamic Metabolic Model
T2  - PROCESSES
AB  - The development of new biologics is becoming more challenging due to global competition and increased requirements for process understanding and assured quality in regulatory approval. As a result, there is a need for predictive, mechanistic process models. These reduce the resources and time required in process development, generating understanding, expanding the possible operating space, and providing the basis for a digital twin for automated process control. Monoclonal antibodies are an important representative of industrially produced biologics that can be used for a wide range of applications. In this work, the validation of a mechanistic process model with respect to sensitivity, as well as accuracy and precision, is presented. For the investigated process conditions, the concentration of glycine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and glutamine have been identified as significant influencing factors for product formation via statistical evaluation. Cell growth is, under the investigated process conditions, significantly dependent on the concentration of glucose within the investigated design space. Other significant amino acids were identified. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to simulate the cultivation run with an optimized medium resulting from the sensitivity analysis. The precision of the model was shown to have a 95% confidence interval. The model shown here includes the implementation of cell death in addition to models described in the literature.

TI  - Dynamic design method of digital twin process model driven by knowledge-evolution machining features
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB  - Machining plan is the core of guiding manufacturing production and is regarded as one of the keys to ensure the quality of product processing. Existing process design methods are inefficient to quickly handle the machining plan changed induced by the unpredictable events in real-time production. It inevitably causes time and economic losses for the enterprise. In order to express the evolutionary characteristics of product processing, the construction method of digital twin process model (DTPM) is proposed based on the knowledge-evolution machining features. Three key technologies include correlation structure of process knowledge, expression method of the evolution geometric features and the association mechanism between two are solved. On this basis, the construction framework of DTPM is illustrated. Then, the organisation and management mechanism of multi-source heterogeneous data is discussed in detail. At last, a case study of the complex machined part is researched, the results show that the processing time reduced by about 7% and the processing stability improved by 40%. Meanwhile, the implementation scheme, application process and effect of this case are described in detail to provide reference for enterprises.

TI  - Digital Twin in Process Planning of the Additive and Subtractive Process Chain for Laser Metal Deposition and Micro Milling of Stainless Steel
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB  - Additive and subtractive (Add/Sub) manufacturing processes are increasingly being combined to produce complex parts with unique geometries and properties. However, the design of such combined processes is often challenging as it requires a deep understanding of the interaction between the different processes. On the other hand, digital twin (DT) technology has become a powerful tool in recent years for optimizing manufacturing processes. This article explores the use of the digital twin technology for a holistic process planning of combined additive and subtractive processes. The article describes the integration of laser metal deposition (LMD) and micro-milling prediction models of resulting geometry (width and height), hardness, and surface roughness into the digital twin. This is then used for combined process planning to achieve different target values regarding resulting geometry and surface roughness. For the planning of this combined process chain, further criteria such as tool life, energy, and process time are considered in the optimization, showing the potential for sustainable and efficient production. Sensorless cutting force estimation is also used to detect small cutting forces, with the potential to use this as a soft sensor for roughness estimation. The measured width, height, and roughness as a result of the process parameters suggested by the optimization algorithms showed a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 4, 17, and 16%, respectively.

TI  - Electronic Artificial Intelligence-Digital Twin Model for Optimizing Electroencephalogram Signal Detection
T2  - ELECTRONICS
AB  - The study is focused on the application of the electronic proof of concept Digital Twin (DT) model supporting Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal detection and interpretation. The EEG DT model integrates two open source tools: a first tool used for the circuit modeling and simulation of the electrodes, and a second one implementing an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-supervised algorithm to classify and adjust a noisy EEG signal. Specifically, the DT model adopts the Random Forest (RF) AI-supervised algorithm, replacing the signal filtering process and facilitating the time-domain peak and the wave shape morphology reading of a noisy detection. In order to prove the DT's efficacy, the RF model is trained by considering the specific case of detections of EEG of patients under the effects of alcohol. The choice of the RF algorithm is justified by its good performance parameters. For the specific dataset, the RF exhibits a probabilistic error slightly lower than that of the ANN and a better cleaning action. The goal of the paper is to provide a methodology to use 'intelligent' electrodes supporting EEG data processing during data acquisition and to optimize the measurement's interpretation through a data post-processing process. The proposed EEG DT could represent an alternative to the traditional denoising signal processing approaches.

TI  - The process correlation interaction construction of Digital Twin for dynamic characteristics of machine tool structures with multi-dimensional variables
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS
AB  - Digital Twin (DT) has become the foundation for intelligent manufacturing as a breakthrough application technology framework and can solve complex vibration problems in the machining process. However, this technology is mainly aimed at application development in a specific domain or a particular factor. The process correlation and interaction characteristics of the system have not been reflected, thus making it challenging to capture the dynamic characteristics of the machining process. This paper presents a system-oriented DT framework with process correlation interaction mechanism that integrates multiple models for dynamic process modeling. The data model is constructed as the core driving model of DT. Based on structural dynamics theory, the weak machine components are taken as digital threads of the data model to correlate position variables and cutting excitation variables. Then, the Frequency Response Function (FRF) corresponding to the principal mode of vibration at the weak machine component is used as an intermediate data for overall online process performance characterization and DT model interaction to enable mirror synchronization of the operation process. The results show that the presented DT can provide multifunctional applications such as cutting parameters optimization, process correlated variables visualization, and machining stability assessment.

TI  - A Digital Twin Framework With Bayesian Optimization and Deep Learning for Semiconductor Process Control
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - This paper introduces an intelligent optimization framework that integrates Digital Twin (DT) technology, deep learning, and a tailored Multi-Restart Bayesian Optimization with Random Initialization (MRBORI) to enhance parameter control and yield in semiconductor manufacturing. The proposed framework synergizes XGBoost-based feature selection, which identifies critical parameters in high-dimensional spaces, with a custom deep learning surrogate model that captures complex nonlinear interactions. Building on these insights, the MRBORI strategy leverages multiple optimization restarts, each initialized randomly, to mitigate local minima risks and systematically explore broad parameter spaces. Experimental validation using real-world data from an epitaxial silicon carbide (Epi SiC) process demonstrates notably tighter thickness control and improved yield compared to traditional methods. By unifying DT-driven real-time insights with advanced machine learning and multi-restart optimization, this framework offers a robust and precise solution for tackling the complexities of modern semiconductor manufacturing.

TI  - Integrating Materials Model-Based Definitions into Design, Manufacturing, and Sustainment: A Digital Twin Demonstration of Incorporating Residual Stresses in the Lifecycle Analysis of a Turbine Disk
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING
AB  - Model-based definitions (MBDs) aim to capture both geometric and non-geometric data in digital product definitions using 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models, as a form of product definition baseline, to disseminate product information across different stages of the lifecycle. MBDs can potentially eliminate error-prone information exchange associated with traditional paper-based drawings and improve the fidelity of component details, captured using 3D CAD models. A component's behavior during its lifecycle stages influences its downstream performance, and if included within the MBD of a part, could be used to forecast performance upfront during the design and explore newer designs to enhance performance. However, current CAD capabilities limit associating behavioral information with the component's shape definition. This paper presents a CAD-based tool to store and retrieve metadata using point objects within a CAD model, creating linkages to spatial locations within the component. The tool is illustrated for storage and retrieval of bulk residual stresses developed during the manufacturing of a turbine disk acquired from process modeling and characterization. Further, variations in residual stress distribution owing to process model uncertainties have been captured as separate instances of the disk's CAD models to represent part-to-part variability as an analogy to track individual serialized components for digital twins. The propagation of varying residual stresses from these CAD models within the damage tolerance analysis performed at critical locations in the disk has been demonstrated. The combination of geometric and non-geometric data inside the MBD, via storage of spatial and feature varying information, presents opportunities to create digital twin(s) of actual component(s).

TI  - Development of a Generic Implementation Strategy of Digital Twins in Logistics Systems under Consideration of the German Rail Transport
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Featured ApplicationUtilization of research results to realizing digital twins in logistic systems of the rail transport.In the course of digitalization, the concept of the digital twin (DT) has become increasingly important in recent years. Hereby, initial concept approaches focus on use cases in industrial production. Although the concept has diverse potential for the asset intensive and increasingly important German rail transport sector. Due to the still low level of research of the DT, there are few empirical values on how this promising concept can be implemented in a target-oriented manner. In a qualitative-explorative research design, this work focuses on answering the question of how a generic implementation strategy (GIS) of DTs in logistics systems of German rail transport can be designed. The central result of this work is a validated GIS which has a sufficient level of detail for the targeted implementation of DTs. Due to its socio-technical system focus, this process model enables user-oriented development and consideration of the complex framework conditions of German rail transport for the first time. The perspective use of the GIS as well as the utilization of the derived recommendations for action contribute to realizing DTs. Consequently, this work is to be regarded as an important instrument for achieving the operational optimization and intelligent management of rail transport assets.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB  - Additive manufacturing (AM) has revolutionized the way we design, prototype, and produce complex parts with unprecedented geometries. However, the lack of understanding of the functional properties of 3D-printed parts has hindered their adoption in critical applications where reliability and durability are paramount. This paper proposes a novel approach to the functional qualification of 3D-printed parts via physical and digital twins. Physical twins are parts that are printed under the same process conditions as the functional parts and undergo a wide range of (destructive) tests to determine their mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. Digital twins are virtual replicas of the physical twins that are generated using finite element analysis (FEA) simulations based on the 3D shape of the part of interest. We propose a novel approach to transfer learning, specifically designed for the fusion of diverse, unstructured 3D shape data and process inputs from multiple sources. The proposed approach has demonstrated remarkable results in predicting the functional properties of 3D-printed lattice structures. From an engineering standpoint, this paper introduces a comprehensive and innovative methodology for the functional qualification of 3D-printed parts. By combining the strengths of physical and digital twins with transfer learning, our approach opens up possibilities for the widespread adoption of 3D printing in safety-critical applications. Methodologically, this work presents a significant advancement in transfer learning techniques, specifically addressing the challenges of multi-source (e.g., digital and physical twins) and multi-input (e.g., 3D shapes and process variables) transfer learning.

TI  - Development of Whole System Digital Twins for Advanced Reactors: Leveraging Graph Neural Networks and SAM Simulations
T2  - NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY
AB  - In this work, we introduce a novel method to develop whole system digital twins (DTs) for advanced nuclear reactors. This method treats a complex reactor system as a heterogeneous graph: with the system components as different types of graph nodes and their physical interconnections as edges. Based on the heterogeneous graph, a graph neural network combining graph convolution and temporal node attention is developed as the DT, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the system's dynamic behavior. By utilizing the System Analysis Module (SAM) code for simulating various operational transients, we develop a graph-based database that trains the DT. This DT is characterized by two primary functions: It can infer the entire system's status using sparse node information, and it can predict the progress of transients based on current and historical system information. Our approach is validated through case studies on the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II) system and a generic Fluoride-salt-cooled High-temperature Reactor (gFHR), demonstrating the DT's accuracy in forecasting operational transients. The DT's rapid computation capabilities enhance its potential for supporting advanced reactor operations, offering benefits in intelligent simulation, autonomous control, and anomaly detection, paving the way for improved safety analysis and intelligent component health management for advanced reactor systems and reducing their operations and maintenance cost.

This study seeks to discuss the synthesis of a digital twin that couples in-formation between the physical space through ERT as a monitoring sensor and the digital space using SWI simulations to accurately model the behavior of SWI in the present and future settings. To showcase the concept, a Python-based simulation was presented that shows (a) the joint forward modeling-simulation scheme for calculating expected ERT apparent resis-tivity values from simulated SWI and (b) the calibra-tion of the digital coastal aquifer system through ge-netic algorithm to accurately match the outputs of the SWI simulations with the ERT measurements.

TI  - Process Design and Optimization towards Digital Twins for HIV-Gag VLP Production in HEK293 Cells, including Purification
T2  - PROCESSES
AB  - Despite great efforts to develop a vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS if untreated, no approved HIV vaccine is available to date. A promising class of vaccines are virus-like particles (VLPs), which were shown to be very effective for the prevention of other diseases. In this study, production of HI-VLPs using different 293F cell lines, followed by a three-step purification of HI-VLPs, was conducted. The quality-by-design-based process development was supported by process analytical technology (PAT). The HI-VLP concentration increased 12.5-fold while >80% purity was achieved. This article reports on the first general process development and optimization up to purification. Further research will focus on process development for polishing and formulation up to lyophilization. In addition, process analytical technology and process modeling for process automation and optimization by digital twins in the context of quality-by-design framework will be developed.

TI  - Architectural and Technological Improvements to Integrated Bioprocess Models towards Real-Time Applications
T2  - BIOENGINEERING-BASEL
AB  - Integrated or holistic process models may serve as the engine of a digital asset in a multistep-process digital twin. Concatenated individual-unit operation models are effective at propagating errors over an entire process, but are nonetheless limited in certain aspects of recent applications that prevent their deployment as a plausible digital asset, particularly regarding bioprocess development requirements. Sequential critical quality attribute tests along the process chain that form output-input (i.e., pool-to-load) relationships, are impacted by nonaligned design spaces at different scales and by simulation distribution challenges. Limited development experiments also inhibit the exploration of the overall design space, particularly regarding the propagation of extreme noncontrolled parameter values. In this contribution, bioprocess requirements are used as the framework to improve integrated process models by introducing a simplified data model for multiunit operation processes, increasing statistical robustness, adding a new simulation flow for scale-dependent variables, and describing a novel algorithm for extrapolation in a data-driven environment. Lastly, architectural and procedural requirements for a deployed digital twin are described, and a real-time workflow is proposed, thus providing a final framework for a digital asset in bioprocessing along the full product life cycle.

AB  - The production of food is highly complex due to the various chemo-physical and biological processes that must be controlled for transforming ingredients into final products. Further, production processes must be adapted to the variability of the ingredients, e.g., due to seasonal fluctuations of raw material quality. Digital twins are known from Industry 4.0 as a method to model, simulate, and optimize processes. In this vision paper, we describe the concept of a digital food twin. Due to the variability of the raw materials, such a digital twin has to take into account not only the processing steps but also the chemical, physical, or microbiological properties that change the food independently from the processing. We propose a hybrid modeling approach, which integrates the traditional approach of food process modeling and simulation of the bio-chemical and physical properties with a data-driven approach based on the application of machine learning. This work presents a conceptual framework for our digital twin concept based on explainable artificial intelligence and wearable technology. We discuss the potential in four case studies and derive open research challenges.

TI  - Quantitative Comparison of Simulation and Experiment Enabling a Lithography Digital Twin
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING
AB  - Digital twins of the semiconductor fabrication process provide means for optimization of the physical layout and nanofabrication process design, studying compatibility between desired structures and a process flow, and a pathway to analyze the root causes of defects for state-of-the-art CMOS and MEMS devices. In this paper, a metric for the geometric differences between structures visualized by CD-SEM images is defined, and a computer-vision-based algorithm is developed to evaluate the metric. One of the major uses of such metrics is to compare experimental and simulated images. For this application, numerical results are presented when the simulator is SEMulator3D (R), a physics-based process modeling software system for semiconductor and MEMS devices. Computer vision tools, such as filters, thresholding, and morphology operations, are used to extract geometric features from CD-SEM images and pattern matching and symmetric difference are used to compute the metric. Examples of using the metrics to quantify the geometric similarity between a simulated nanostructure and an experimental CD-SEM image of the fabricated nanostructure are presented. The data consists of eight classes of nanostructures which are defined, fabricated in the cleanroom with 36 combinations of layout parameters, and imaged with a CD-SEM.

TI  - Formalizing a framework of inference capabilities for Digital Twin engineering
T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Nowadays, smart systems require the use of Digital Twins (DTs) for their engineering and management. Self-updating capability is a key feature in the DT technology. This raises the challenge of model inference from data collected on the system and requires a formal framework be defined, in which a system representation can be coupled with inference methods to achieve automatic model updating. While data-based process model inference is a well-known technique, the inference of a simulation model from existing knowledge and collected data is yet an unexplored area. In this paper, we first clarify and explicitly define some key elements of the terminology related to the DT concept, including model update and model inference, and we propose a framework of inference capabilities based on a formal DT specification, which formally captures the conditions for different updating capabilities and relates them. That way, on one hand, the framework enables the use of symbolic approaches to build a DT with the desired inference capability, and on the other hand, it establishes a partial order relation between inference capabilities. Through a case study, we show how the framework helps formally specifying the DT model of a mobility system toward realizing a fully capable DT.

TI  - Toward a systematic reporting framework for Digital Twins: a cooperative robotics case study
T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Digital Twins (DTs) can be constructed for many different applications, leading to substantial differences between different case studies. To be able to learn from the challenges and lessons learned by other DT practitioners, it is important that experience reports be consistent to facilitate comparisons. In this paper, we merge three reference description frameworks for DTs, one generated from a systematic mapping study, one generated from an analysis of experience reports, and one from a systematic literature review, to come up with a unified characterization of DT applications. This analysis has identified six non-overlapping and three cross-cutting characteristics in the reference frameworks. This paper showcases the unified characterization with 21 characteristics to report on a DT case study called the Flex-cell, a manufacturing cell with two robotic arms used for cooperative assembly. The generalizability of this unified characterization is validated using a multi-case approach with another case study in robotics and another in the food industry. We call on the DT community to integrate these systematic reporting principles in their future DT experience reports such that other practitioners can learn from each other more effectively.

TI  - Digital Twin-Driven Human Robot Collaboration Using a Digital Human
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - Advances are being made in applying digital twin (DT) and human-robot collaboration (HRC) to industrial fields for safe, effective, and flexible manufacturing. Using a DT for human modeling and simulation enables ergonomic assessment during working. In this study, a DT-driven HRC system was developed that measures the motions of a worker and simulates the working progress and physical load based on digital human (DH) technology. The proposed system contains virtual robot, DH, and production management modules that are integrated seamlessly via wireless communication. The virtual robot module contains the robot operating system and enables real-time control of the robot based on simulations in a virtual environment. The DH module measures and simulates the worker's motion, behavior, and physical load. The production management module performs dynamic scheduling based on the predicted working progress under ergonomic constraints. The proposed system was applied to a parts-picking scenario, and its effectiveness was evaluated in terms of work monitoring, progress prediction, dynamic scheduling, and ergonomic assessment. This study demonstrates a proof-of-concept for introducing DH technology into DT-driven HRC for human-centered production systems.

TI  - DTUAV: a novel cloud-based digital twin system for unmanned aerial vehicles
T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
AB  - This paper is concerned with the first work on the integration of digital twin (DT), 5G, cloud platform, and virtual reality (VR) technologies for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) autonomy development. DT focuses on connecting the virtual and physical world as an emerging strategic technology. Initially, it was implemented through mirror models of physical objects to realize the monitoring of their whole life cycle in the manufacturing area. In recent years, DT technologies have been applied in different fields, and some typical DT solutions have been proposed to solve complex system problems. In this paper, we study the problem of how to combine the DT and other emerging technologies for UAV autonomy development and supervision, aiming to propose a basic DT framework to integrate DT and UAVs as reference rules for building DT systems, which includes four parts, that is, Virtual Space, Real Space, Service Center, and Data and Model Processing Center. Based on the proposed basic DT framework, a cloud-based DT system is then further constructed in which cloud platform, 5G, and VR are integrated seamlessly. The running and implementation processes of each subsystem are introduced in detail. Multiple experiments are conducted to verify the usefulness of proposed DT system, that is, real-time system monitoring and cloud processing, VR connection, human-robot interaction through VR technology, and so on. The experimental results show that the proposed DTUAV system can be used in the interaction of virtual and physical systems, remote supervision, intelligence integration of swarm of unmanned vehicles, and so on. The development in our work introduces the DT into unmanned system applications and can promote relevant research in this direction. All implementation codes of the system will be shared in https://github.com/DTUAV.

TI  - Federated Data Modeling for Built Environment Digital Twins
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
AB  - The digital twin (DT) approach is an enabler for data-driven decision making in architecture, engineering, construction, and operations. Various open data models that can potentially support the DT developments, at different scales and application domains, can be found in the literature. However, many implementations are based on organization-specific information management processes and proprietary data models, hindering interoperability. This article presents the process and information management approaches developed to generate a federated open data model supporting DT applications. The business process modeling notation and transaction and interaction modeling techniques are applied to formalize the federated DT data modeling framework, organized in three main phases: requirements definition, federation, validation and improvement. The proposed framework is developed adopting the cross-disciplinary and multiscale principles. A validation on the development of the federated building-level DT data model for the West Cambridge Campus DT research facility is conducted. The federated data model is used to enable DT-based asset management applications at the building and built environment levels.

TI  - The Industrial Digital Energy Twin as a Tool for the Comprehensive Optimization of Industrial Processes
T2  - PROCESSES
AB  - Industrial manufacturing processes have evolved and improved since the disruption of the Industry 4.0 paradigm, while energy has progressively become a strategic resource required to maintain industrial competitiveness while maximizing quality and minimizing environmental impacts. In this context of global changes leading to social and economic impact in the short term and an unprecedented climate crisis, Digital Twins for Energy Efficiency in manufacturing processes provide companies with a tool to address this complex situation. Nevertheless, already existing Digital Twins applied for energy efficiency in a manufacturing process lack a flexible structure that easily replicates the real behavior of consuming machines while integrating it in complex upper-level environments. This paper presents a combined multi-paradigm approach to industrial process modeling developed and applied during the GENERTWIN project. The tool allows users to predict energy consumption and costs and, at the same time, evaluates the behavior of the process under certain productive changes to maximize consumption optimization, production efficiency and process flexibility.

TI  - Intelligent Parking Service System Design Based on Digital Twin for Old Residential Areas
T2  - ELECTRONICS
AB  - Due to the increasing number of vehicles and the limited land supply, old residential areas generally face parking difficulties. An intelligent parking service is a critical study direction to address parking difficulty since it can achieve the automatic management of parking processes and planning of parking spaces. However, the existing intelligent parking service systems have shortcomings such as low information quality, low management efficiency, and single service mode. To address the shortcomings, in this paper, we conduct a systematic study on utilizing digital twin (DT) technology to improve the intelligent parking service system. The main contributions are threefold: (1) We analyze the function requirements of the intelligent parking service for old residential areas, such as visual monitoring, refined management, and simulation optimization. (2) We design a DT-based intelligent parking service system by collecting data on physical parking space, constructing the corresponding virtual parking space, and building the user interaction platform. An old residential area in Guangzhou, China is used as a use case to show that the designed parking service system can meet the function requirements. (3) Through mathematical modeling and simulation evaluation, we utilize two typical intelligent parking services including dynamic parking planning and driving safety assessment to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. This study provides innovative solutions for parking management in old residential areas, utilizing DT technology to not only improve information quality and management efficiency, but also provide a theoretical basis and practical reference for the intelligent transformation of urban parking services.

TI  - THE USE OF SIMULATION TECHNIQUES AND MANAGEMENT TOOLS TO OPTIMIZE THE LOGISTICS PROCESS
T2  - LOGFORUM
AB  - . Background: The article discusses the problem of modeling and simulation of the production process, as well as accompanying intralogistics processes in the automotive industry, which are characterized by advanced production standards and high product quality. The analyzed processes concern a Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) for manufacturing a family of gear wheels and a distribution center that operates in a cross-docking regime. The goal of the research is to create a methodology of modeling and simulation of production and intralogistics processes with the help of a digital twin, which aims to integrate the design of production and logistics systems, considering factors such as manipulation and transportation of each product. Therefore, the article emphasizes the optimization of intralogistics processes. Methods: The proposed methodology is based on the Value Stream Mapping (VSM) method, which is used for identifying critical components of the production system being analyzed. The first step involves creating a VSM of the current state of the production system, which can be utilized to model key research areas, such as current planning, scheduling, manufacturing, and intralogistics. Analyzing the map and related models leads to the development of a future state map, used to create improved models of the system. Subsequently, the models are integrated into a digital twin with the use of Results: The results of simulation experiments confirm that the introduction of a FMS with AGV transport allows improvement in the intralogistics system, reduces the production cycle of a planned order package from two days to one day, and improves the distribution process with the use of pallets and short transportation batches, which enables 64 shipments during one shift. The experiments also confirm the stability of the model for different numbers of AGVs and a random inflow of orders. Conclusions: The proposed methodology of creating a digital twin makes it possible to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed improvements and to verify production plans. The advantage of the applied simulations and analyses is the significant reduction in the amount of time spent searching for optimal solutions and storage capacities.

TI  - AI-driven non-intrusive uncertainty quantification of advanced nuclear fuels for digital twin-enabling technology
T2  - PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY
AB  - In response to the urgent need to establish AI/ML-integrated Digital Twin (DT) technology within nextgeneration nuclear systems, advancements in modeling methods and simulation codes are necessary. The increased complexity of models demands significant computational resources to quantify their uncertainties. To address this challenge, a data -driven non -intrusive uncertainty quantification method via polynomial chaos expansion is introduced as an efficient strategy within the finite element analysis -based fuel performance code BISON. Models of UO 2 and U 3 Si 2 fuels, alongside SiC/SiC cladding material, were prepared to demonstrate the proposed method. The impact of four independent uncertain input variables on the system output was quantified, requiring fewer than 100 BISON simulations for each model. This approach not only accelerates the modeling and simulation task but also enhances the reliability in the development of DT -enabling technologies.

T2  - MACHINES
AB  - This research presents an advanced autonomous HVAC control system tailored for a chemical fiber factory, emphasizing the human-centric principles and collaborative potential of Industry 5.0. The system architecture employs several functional levels-actuator and sensor, process, model, critic, fault detection, and specification-to effectively monitor and predict indoor air pressure differences, which are critical for maintaining consistent product quality. Central to the system's innovation is the integration of digital twins and physical AI, enhancing real-time monitoring and predictive capabilities. A virtual representation runs in parallel with the physical system, enabling sophisticated simulation and optimization. Development involved custom sensor kit design, embedded systems, IoT integration leveraging Node-RED for data streaming, and InfluxDB for time-series data storage. AI-driven system identification using Nonlinear Autoregressive with eXogenous inputs (NARX) neural network models significantly improved accuracy. Crucially, incorporating airflow velocity data alongside AHU output and past pressure differences boosted the NARX model's predictive performance (R2 up to 0.9648 on test data). Digital twins facilitate scenario testing and optimization, while physical AI allows the system to learn from real-time data and simulations, ensuring adaptive control and continuous improvement for enhanced operational stability in complex industrial settings.

AB  - For the next coming years, metaverse, digital twin and autonomous vehicle applications are the leading technologies for many complex applications hitherto inaccessible such as health and life sciences, smart home, smart agriculture, smart city, smart car and logistics, Industry 4.0, entertainment (video game) and social media applications, due to recent tremendous developments in process modeling, supercomputing, cloud data analytics (deep learning, etc.), communication network and AIoT/IIoT/IoT technologies. AIoT/IIoT/IoT is a crucial research field because it provides the essential data to fuel metaverse, digital twin, real-time Industry 4.0 and autonomous vehicle applications. However, the science of AIoT is inherently multidisciplinary, and therefore, it is difficult for readers to understand its evolution and impacts. Our main contribution in this article is to analyze and highlight the trends and challenges of the AIoT technology ecosystem including core hardware (MCU, MEMS/NEMS sensors and wireless access medium), core software (operating system and protocol communication stack) and middleware (deep learning on a microcontroller: TinyML). Two low-powered AI technologies emerge: TinyML and neuromorphic computing, but only one AIoT/IIoT/IoT device implementation using TinyML dedicated to strawberry disease detection as a case study. So far, despite the very rapid progress of AIoT/IIoT/IoT technologies, several challenges remain to be overcome such as safety, security, latency, interoperability and reliability of sensor data, which are essential characteristics to meet the requirements of metaverse, digital twin, autonomous vehicle and Industry 4.0. applications.

TI  - Generative adversarial networks based digital twin channel modeling for intelligent communication networks
T2  - CHINA COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Integration of digital twin (DT) and wireless channel provides new solution of channel modeling and simulation, and can assist to design, optimize and evaluate intelligent wireless communication system and networks. With DT channel modeling, the generated channel data can be closer to realistic channel measurements without requiring a prior channel model, and amount of channel data can be significantly increased. Artificial intelligence (AI) based modeling approach shows outstanding performance to solve such problems. In this work, a channel modeling method based on generative adversarial networks is proposed for DT channel, which can generate identical statistical distribution with measured channel. Model validation is conducted by comparing DT channel characteristics with measurements, and results show that DT channel leads to fairly good agreement with measured channel. Finally, a link-layer simulation is implemented based on DT channel. It is found that the proposed DT channel model can be well used to conduct link-layer simulation and its performance is comparable to using measurement data. The observations and results can facilitate the development of DT channel modeling and provide new thoughts for DT channel applications, as well as improving the performance and reliability of intelligent communication networking.

TI  - A data-driven approach toward a machine- and system-level performance monitoring digital twin for production lines
T2  - COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY
AB  - Efficient performance monitoring in production systems holds paramount importance as it enables organizations to optimize their manufacturing processes, enhance productivity, and maintain a competitive edge in the market. Typically, machine and system level performance monitoring systems are investigated independently, whereas an integrated approach that considers both levels can offer valuable insights and benefits. This paper introduces a data -driven approach for evaluating and improving the performance of production lines by monitoring the performance of both individual machines and their interactions as a system. The approach begins with a rigorous methodology for classifying machine states recorded by the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) into finer -grained substates, enabling a comprehensive analysis of machine cycle time variability. Subsequently, these substates are leveraged as a foundation for constructing performance monitoring models at both the machine and system levels, employing probabilistic automata for the machine level and logistic regression for the system level. The system -level performance monitoring model is constructed to predict a Flow metric that enables the prediction of abnormal behaviors and deviations from production targets. This data -driven approach serves as a foundational ingredient of a system -level digital twin, designed to provide production lines with insights that enable proactive implementation of measures aimed at optimizing overall manufacturing efficiency. Through an industrial test case from the automotive industry, the results demonstrate the capability of performance monitoring, capturing errors within confidence intervals, and establishing predictive cause -and -effect relationships between machines within the production system.

TI  - A Digital Twin Modeling Method for the Full Lifecycle of Discrete Product
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The digital twin (DT), as a dynamic intelligence system that organically combines virtual and realistic models and multiple sources of data, fully combines numerical models with real-world data to monitor the operational status of products and predict their lifespan. Therefore, a system modeling approach with high fidelity and timeliness is of great significance for DT models. However, most current DT modeling approaches focus on individual objects and individual aspects of a product, while being deficient in a full lifecycle and multi-object-oriented modeling approach, which is not conducive to the mining and utilization of data on the whole product. Given this challenge, a product-level DT modeling approach based on PLM/PDM theory is proposed in this paper. It combines property model, simulation model, process model, status model, quality model, and feedback model through a digital thread communication framework to collect and utilize product lifecycle data to achieve accurate control of all aspects of the product lifecycle. The product-level DT results are presented by a visualization platform that enables interaction between customers, designers, and fabricators under real-time monitoring of the product manufacturing process throughout the system. Finally, a test case of a wind energy generator was performed to validate the proposed product-level DT modeling approach. The results revealed that the proposed approach is effective and feasible.

TI  - New method for modeling digital twin behavior perception of cows: Cow daily behavior recognition based on multimodal data
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
AB  - The cow digital shadow reflects the behavior, health condition, and productivity of cows, playing a crucial role in ensuring animal welfare, increasing individual productivity, and improving breeding efficiency. To fully utilize the existing multimodal data on farms and build a cow digital shadow with rich behavioral information, this study proposes a multimodal data fusion algorithm for recognizing cow behaviors such as drinking, feeding, lying, standing, and walking. This algorithm leverages the strengths of different data modalities, complementing each other, and enhances the performance of the cow behavior classification model. The algorithm integrates motion sensor and video data, collected by custom-made collars with inertial measurement units (IMUs) sensors placed at the top of the cow's neck and cameras in the barn, using EfficientNet V2 S, BiLSTM, and Transformer networks. Experimental results demonstrate recognition accuracies of 98.80 %, precision of 97.15 %, and recall rates of 96.93 %, showing significant improvements over single-modal data behavior recognition algorithms. This method maximizes the utility of existing multimodal data to generate a cow digital shadow with detailed behavioral information, enhancing the modeling and simulation element of the cow digital twin architecture and laying the foundation for developing a comprehensive cow behavior data model.

TI  - Scalable and Physical Radar Sensor Simulation for Interacting Digital Twins
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
AB  - Automation, artificial intelligence and sensor-enabled applications are part of everyday life comprising technical systems that utilize environment-perceiving sensors. Here, rough environments often require robust sensor technologies such as radar, coupled with application-specific software evaluating the measured data. The rising complexity of underlying sensor systems (hard- and software) and complex physical interactions with dynamic environments require development-related validations that use virtual methods primarily focusing on close-to-reality sensor simulation. To allow for a wide range of applications, we propose the use of reusable building blocks that generically model and mimic the physical structure from the real world. This includes the whole path between sensor and 3D environment with respect to sensor-intrinsic characteristics as well as environmental influences such as rain. At the same time, computational scalability of each building block allows physical simulations generating reliable sensor data even in real-time applications. As a result, Digital Twins of relevant components, systems and environments are no longer acting on their own but interacting within Virtual Testbeds allowing for virtual validation of radar-based applications with respect to the operational environment.

TI  - Physics-Based Compressive Sensing to Enable Digital Twins of Additive Manufacturing Processes
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING
AB  - Sensors play an important role in monitoring manufacturing processes and update their digital twins. However, the data transmission bandwidth and sensor placement limitations in the physical systems may not allow us to collect the amount or the type of data that we wish. Recently, a physics-based compressive sensing (PBCS) approach was proposed to monitor manufacturing processes and obtain high-fidelity information with the reduced number of sensors by incorporating physical models of processes in compressed sensing. It can recover and reconstruct complete three-dimensional temperature distributions based on some limited measurements. In this paper, a constrained orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is developed for PBCS, where coherence exists between the measurement matrix and the basis matrix. The efficiency of recovery is improved by introducing a boundary-domain reduction approach, which reduces the size of PBCS model matrices during the inverse operations. The improved PBCS method is demonstrated with the measurement of temperature distributions in the cooling and real-time printing processes of fused filament fabrication.

TI  - Virtual Prototyping for Modern Internet-of-Things Applications: A Survey
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Modern technological industries fused with the Internet-of-Things (IoT) have been advancing rapidly. The joint usage of several technologies has led to the reshaping of the modeling and simulation techniques into the virtualization of physical systems. Thus, the concept of virtual prototyping has emerged as a significant development in distributed IoT applications that includes early exploration, optimization, and security assessments. Several industries have been employing various types of prototyping e.g., virtual platforms, digital twins, and application-specific virtualization techniques, to achieve individual needs for development. In this survey, we clarify some of these concepts and the distinctions between them, provide a comprehensive overview of various prototyping technologies, and discuss how several virtualization technologies play a transformative role in the design and operation of intelligent cyber-physical systems.

TI  - Physics-Based Digital Twin Identifies Trade-Offs Between Drying Time, Fruit Quality, and Energy Use for Solar Drying
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Solar drying is regarded as a less reliable process compared to continuous hot-air drying due to the intermittency of solar radiation. This problem is mitigated by equipping solar dryers with thermal storage, dehumidifier units, or auxiliary heating that enhances drying continuity during night time. In this study, we combine a mechanistic fruit drying model, quality models (vitamin C decay and browning reaction) and weather data to evaluate the drying characteristics and quality evolution of apple fruit with and without the aforementioned improvement strategies. By coupling to measured weather conditions, a digital twin of the drying fruit is established. The twin outputs drying times and final product quality for a specific fruit type and size, a particular dryer configuration, and specific weather conditions. The trade-offs between drying time, final product quality and energy use for the different improvement strategies of solar drying are documented. We found that solar drying may benefit from the slower drying due to the improvement of product quality. Compared to the other improvement strategies, dehumidification of the drying air is shown to be superior in retaining the vitamin C content and prohibiting the browning reaction. However, in general, drying with auxiliary heating is found to balance the trade-offs between drying time, final product quality and energy use since the weather-dependency of the process is mitigated. Additionally, we quantified the impact of a pre-treatment process that modifies the permeability of the fruit tissue by breaking the cell membrane. We found that inducing such lysis is more effective in decreasing the drying time when drying is conducted at low (room) temperature. This study shows that using the developed digital twin, future drying process and control strategies could be optimized in real-time for every single drying run.

TI  - A holistic digital twin simulation framework for industrial facilities: BIM-based data acquisition for building energy modeling
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Energy and resource efficiency as well as reduction of emissions are nowadays significant objectives for production companies. Industry 4.0, through extensive digitalization along the value chain, enables the achievement of these objectives not only in the construction of new facilities but also in existing facilities as well. This requires an interdisciplinary approach, extending over production and logistic processes as well as the building, technical building services, and energy supply systems, consolidated through integrated modeling and simulation-based optimization. The research question this study addresses is how to digitally couple these subsystems and optimize the overall system's performance in terms of energy and resource efficiency, by distancing from silo-field thinking while using an integrated analysis approach. The article briefly presents a holistic modeling and simulation framework, utilizing modular digital twins (DTs) of all elements that may constitute a given industrial unit. The integration of multiple DTs of these subsystems in a hybrid (continuous and discrete) simulation forms a holistic DT ecosystem of an existing facility. The particular focus of the study is the building representation in this DT ecosystem for energy-efficient production. Based on a methodology including hybrid simulation, building information modeling (BIM), and visual programming, a semi-automated data acquisition workflow was proposed. The hybrid simulation is based on Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) formalism, where the building is incorporated as a building energy model (BEM). Within the abstracted representation of the overall system, the article explores the possibilities of parametrizing the DT of the building, interconnected with the rest of the factory elements, by acquiring information directly from existing BIM models. Through a comparative case study, the proposed workflow is compared to a manual one in terms of integrity and benefits. The study's contribution lies in: 1) the detection of the required building level of abstraction for a holistic DT ecosystem, 2) the definition of the interconnections between the building-related counterparts and the rest of the virtual environment as well as the data required for their parameterization, and 3) proposing a semi-automated workflow via virtual programming, for BIM-based creation of the building model within a holistic DT ecosystem.

TI  - Towards a digital twin realization of the blade system design study wind turbine blade
T2  - WIND AND STRUCTURES
AB  - This paper describes the application of a novel virtual prototyping methodology to wind turbine blade design. Numeric modelling data and experimental data about turbine blade geometry and structural/dynamical behaviour are combined to obtain an affordable digital twin model useful in reducing the undesirable uncertainties during the entire turbine lifecycle. Moreover, this model can be used to track and predict blade structural changes, due for example to structural damage, and to assess its remaining life. A new interactive and recursive process is proposed. It includes CAD geometry generation and finite element analyses, combined with experimental data gathered from the structural testing of a new generation wind turbine blade. The goal of the research is to show how the unique features of a complex wind turbine blade are considered in the virtual model updating process, fully exploiting the computational capabilities available to the designer in modern engineering. A composite Sandia National Laboratories Blade System Design Study (BSDS) turbine blade is used to exemplify the proposed process. Static, modal and fatigue experimental testing are conducted at Clarkson University Blade Test Facility. A digital model was created and updated to conform to all the information available from experimental testing. When an updated virtual digital model is available the performance of the blade during operation can be assessed with higher confidence.

TI  - Digital twin-driven centering process optimization for high-precision glass lens
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS
AB  - Glass lenses are key photoelectric components of laser systems in semiconductor equipment. The circularity, surface quality, and optical axis precision of the glass lens directly affect the efficiency of a laser system. In the processing of conventional glass lenses, centering is often used to meet specification requirements. However, high-precision processing of materials with high hardness and low ductility is difficult. The process of centering a glass lens is performed according to processing parameters determined by experience, the degree of wear of the grinding wheel, and specifications of the glass lens. Circularity errors, edge cracks, and optical axis errors are common defects in lens processing; such defects must be identified through manual inspection and thus result in high scrap rates and production costs. To address this problem, a digital twin-driven (DTD) centering process optimization system for high-precision glass lenses was developed in this study. The proposed system combines an omnidirectional information model of production line manufacturing data, a virtual process model based on sensor signals, and a design of experiment-based genetic algorithm (DOE-GA). The models of the system are connected through data flow and operate simultaneously to create a high-fidelity virtual simulation of the centering process. To facilitate evaluation of the performance of the proposed DTD centering process, the process was implemented in an industrial setting. The test in the real-world production line shows that the proposed DTD system reduces the time of process development from 4 h to 1 h, decreases the inspection from full to 10% sampling inspection and improves the yield rate by 20%.

TI  - Orchestration constraints BlockChained smart contract and integrated digital twins manufacturing systems: ManuChain4.0-based application paradigm and case study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS
AB  - Decentralized manufacturing systems constrained by blockchain significantly enhances data security and process integrity. Nevertheless, intelligent workshops encounter hurdles related to scalability of nodes, efficiency in validation, configuration of process security, and management of online/offline operations, which pose challenges to the seamless application of blockchain in workshop manufacturing environments. This paper introduces an architecture based on BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) for integrating smart contracts and digital twins manufacturing systems. It explores effective strategies to address the challenges mentioned above, with the aim of enhancing integration and application approaches. (1) Utilizing a graphical model-driven solution for the visualization and configuration of manufacturing resources on the front end, creating a BPMN-driven orchestration diagram and an off-chain/on-chain interoperability model for manufacturing smart contracts, and investigating voting mechanisms and customization methods specific to smart contracts in workshop manufacturing; (2) The two-layer monitoring model based on blockchain 3.0 and Tangle-based verification backend is established by introducing Cached DTs to implement negotiation of smart contracts based on BPMN constraints at the upper level, and supporting device node expansion and verification mechanisms at the lower level, thereby realizing swift synchronization and comprehensive visualization across the entire manufacturing lifecycle; (3) Based on multiple open -source technologies, a decentralized intelligent workshop case that relies on distributed information management is constructed. The comprehensive experimental results underscore the technical superiority of the proposed system architecture.

TI  - Simulation of worker collaboration in production cell based on hybrid model under fluctuating environment
T2  - FLEXIBLE SERVICES AND MANUFACTURING JOURNAL
AB  - Flexible cooperative production workers are important for the performance and flexibility of the production cell. In this paper, a human-machine integrated hybrid modeling method is first proposed, which combines the discrete process model with the multi-agent model to simulate the collaborative behavior of workers in a discrete production process. Model structure, simulation process, and worker collaboration behaviors are illustrated in detail. An embedded framework of digital twins is established based on the simulation. Simulation experiments are then carried out on two changeover-based collaboration schemes in a variable-batch mixed-flow production cell under different production environment conditions, to obtain the dynamic and adaptive collaboration scheme. Both the performance indexes and the flexibility indexes of the production cell are evaluated, to achieve a quantitative evaluation of flexibility. The results show that the impact of workers' behaviors on production performance differs for the various collaboration schemes and dynamic production environments. Autonomous collaboration scheme shows better performance only under high environmental fluctuation level, but has a higher flexibility considering all fluctuation levels. This study can help managers realize the best match between humans, machines and the environment by improving workers' collaboration behaviors.

TI  - Colosseum as a Digital Twin: Bridging Real-World Experimentation and Wireless Network Emulation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING
AB  - Wireless network emulators are being increasingly used for developing and evaluating new solutions for Next Generation (NextG) wireless networks. However, the reliability of the solutions tested on emulation platforms heavily depends on the precision of the emulation process, model design, and parameter settings. To address, obviate, or minimize the impact of errors of emulation models, in this work, we apply the concept of Digital Twin (DT) to large-scale wireless systems. Specifically, we demonstrate the use of Colosseum, the world's largest wireless network emulator with hardware-in-the-loop, as a DT for NextG experimental wireless research at scale. As proof of concept, we leverage the Channel emulation scenario generator and Sounder Toolchain (CaST) to create the DT of a publicly available over-the-air indoor testbed for sub-6 GHz research, namely, Arena. Then, we validate the Colosseum DT through experimental campaigns on emulated wireless environments, including scenarios concerning cellular networks and jamming of Wi-Fi nodes, on both the real and digital systems. Our experiments show that the DT is able to provide a faithful representation of the real-world setup, obtaining an average similarity of up to 0.987 in throughput and 0.982 in Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR).

TI  - Adaptive hybrid reasoning for agent-based digital twins of distributed multi-robot systems
T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The digital twin (DT) mainly acts as a virtual exemplification of a real-world entity, system, or process via multiphysical and logical models, allowing the capture and synchronization of its functions and attributes. The bridge between the actual system and the digital realm can be utilized to optimize the system's performance, and forecast and predict its behavior. Incorporating intelligent and adaptive reasoning mechanisms into DTs is crucial to enable them to reason, adapt, and take efficacious actions in complex and dynamic environments. To this end, we introduce an approach for deploying agent-based DTs for cyber-physical systems. The foundation pillars of this approach are (1) integrating the concepts, entities, and relations of Zeigler's modeling and simulation framework from the perspective of agent-based DTs; (2) utilizing an expandable and scalable architecture for designing and materializing these twins, which handily enables extending and scaling physical and digital assets of the system; and finally (3) a two-tier reasoning strategy; reactive and rational models are conceptually redefined in the context of the modeling and simulation framework of agent-based DTs and technically deployed to boost the adaptive reasoning and decision-making function of DTs. As a result, an implemented simulation and control platform for a multi-robot system demonstrates the approach's applicability and feasibility, manifesting its usability and efficiency. The platform represents physical entities as autonomous agents, creates their DTs, and assigns adequate reasoning capability to promote adaptive planning, autonomous resource management, and flexible logical decision-making to handle different situations and scenarios.

TI  - Development of Digital Twins for Continuous Processes: Concept Description of Virtual Mass Balance Based on the Tennessee Eastman Process
T2  - PROCESSES
AB  - In this work, the authors describe a concept called Virtual Mass Balance and its applicability to oil and gas fields. This study relies on data modelling and data engineering to enrich operational data and achieve digitized Material Balance Tables for monitoring and benchmarking purposes. A data-driven set of stream properties allow for the calculation of newly proposed soft sensors, which are subsequently used for predictive functionalities. The implementation of this concept has proven popular in an industry set of tools, AVEVA PI. The concept could be classified as an Enriched Digital Twin. Incorporating the DEXPI Process model and deploying proposed soft sensors could, on the one hand, combine both asset and operational characteristics. On the other hand, its simplicity and moderate level of detail can be much easier to implement and would show flexible applicability at various corporate levels. The application of the Tennessee Eastman Process proves its flexibility. The presented soft sensors exhibit good monitoring capabilities and, furthermore, allow for the application of data-driven artificial intelligence methods without a reduction in model clarity for operational staff.

TI  - Models and P4R asset description for digital twin-based advanced planning and scheduling using cyber-physical integration for resilient production operation
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS
AB  - Advanced planning and scheduling (APS) addresses the complex and uncertain nature of production control. A digital twin (DT), which incorporates simulations through cyber-physical integration, provides an advanced functionality for APS. To facilitate efficient design and implementation, a DT-based APS must satisfy three requirements: technical functionalities for resilience, robust models for diverse operational constraints, and efficient interoperability through cyber-physical integration. Although several studies have proposed the use of DT as a primary technology for APS, proposals that address the process, functionality, integration, and information models are lacking. Additionally, the existing asset descriptions cannot adequately capture the sophisticated characteristics of DT and necessary informational elements for APS. Thus, this study designed a process model, functionalities, and integration models for the DT-based APS and asset descriptions for snapshot synchronization. Crucial service-compositions and functionalities were defined using work-center-level lifecycles. Consequently, a process model was developed, which focused on core activities for resilience. Moreover, horizontal integration between DT and control functionalities and vertical integration between DT and standards, were proposed to enhance the DT-based APS. The proposed method effectively managed the product, process, plan, plant, and resource classes by ensuring adherence to asset administration shell principles. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, two work centers with distinctly different characteristics were employed and demonstrated dominant preventive measures compared to static functionality-based methods. The primary contributions encompass the facilitation of integration and interoperability within a DT-based APS. The proposed methods support the advanced characteristics of DT, ensuring robustness and neutrality across heterogeneous operational contexts.

TI  - The model-based development of a dynamic test bench for testing damper assemblies with a focus on amplitudes with small excitations
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART D-JOURNAL OF AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING
AB  - Damper assemblies are often tested on test benches with relatively large displacement amplitudes at high velocities. Stochastic excitations, as road irregularities can usually be described, have a high proportion of amplitudes with small excitations; the so-called small signals. Testing with small signals poses special challenges for test benches. A methodology is presented that uses a quarter vehicle model and synthetically generated road irregularities to estimate the displacement, velocity, and acceleration amplitudes occurring at a damper assembly model. In order to describe a more realistic vehicle behavior, the synthetically generated road irregularities undergo a reduction of the amplitudes in corresponding frequency ranges by means of linear filters. The evaluation of the amplitudes occurring at the damper assembly is used to make a selection of the actuator for the test bench. A nonlinear dynamic model of the test bench, a so-called "Digital Twin," is then created, which focuses on both, the model of the permanent magnet synchronous machine and the mechanical model of the linear actuator. Furthermore, a controller optimization procedure is used to virtually optimize the test bench's controller parameters. Using the optimized parameters after the build process of the test bench, damper assembly tests with small signals of high quality are possible. With the help of virtual development methods such as synthetically created filtered road irregularities and with a Digital Twin of the test bench, a fast test bench development is possible. Realistic results can be achieved.

TI  - Towards digital twins of waste sorting plants: Developing data-driven process models of industrial-scale sensor-based sorting units by combining machine learning with near-infrared-based process monitoring
T2  - RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB  - Sorting plants are crucial for effective recycling, but their optimization can be challenging due to the heterogeneity of waste streams. We introduce a novel approach to holistically optimize sorting plants using digital twins containing data-driven process models. To demonstrate their technical feasibility, we developed a data -driven process model for industrial-scale sensor-based sorting (SBS) units by combining near-infrared process monitoring with machine learning. Our results indicate a sorting performance change (F1-score) in the SBS unit by 0.22 a% for +1% occupation density and +0.19 a% for +1 wt% target material share. An artificial neural network predicted the SBS behavior with a 3.0% mean absolute error. Our case study demonstrates the potential of data-driven process models for digital twins by clarifying the influence of throughput fluctuations on SBS performance and simulating different SBS cascade designs, thus paving the way towards improved design and operation of sorting plants and a more circular future.

TI  - Blockchain-Based Decentralized Learning for Security in Digital Twins
T2  - IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB  - This work aims to analyze malicious communication behaviors that pose a threat to the security of digital twins (DTs) and safeguard user privacy. A unified and integrated multidimensional DTs Network (DTN) architecture is constructed. On this basis, the propagation process model of malware in the network is built to analyze the malicious propagation behavior that threatens network security. This model ensures the protection of mobile distributed machine learning system security. Blockchain technology is a distributed data protection mechanism with broad prospects. It is characterized by decentralization, transparency, and anonymity, which can help ensure secure network data sharing and privacy protection. Based on this, this work designs a secure distributed data sharing (DDS) architecture based on blockchain to improve the security and reliability of data protection with the support of the Internet of Things (IoT). Then, digital resource allocation based on semi-distributed learning is examined to propose a broad learning federated continuous learning (BL-FCL) algorithm combining blockchain and DTs. This algorithm significantly speeds up the model training process. Broad learning technology supports incremental learning. In this way, each client does not need to retrain when learning the newly generated data. In the experimental part, the prediction accuracy of BL-FCL on the mixed national institute of standards and technology data set is similar to that of the FedAvg-50 and FedAvg-80 schemes. As the number of devices increases from 1 to 6, the detection probability exhibits a rapid decrease. However, as the number of devices further increases from 6 to 10, the detection probability gradually decreases at a slower rate until it reaches 0. Comparatively, the prediction accuracy of the BL-FCL outperforms the federated averaging algorithm-based scheme by 20%-60%. The BL-FCL reported here can deal with the problem of inaccurate training while ensuring the privacy and security of users. This work is of great significance for ensuring the security of the DTN and promoting the development of the digital economy. The results can provide references for applying blockchain and distributed learning in the DT field.

TI  - A framework for data-driven digitial twins of smart manufacturing systems
T2  - COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY
AB  - Adoption of digital twins in smart factories, that model real statuses of manufacturing systems through simulation with real time actualization, are manifested in the form of increased productivity, as well as reduction in costs and energy consumption. The sharp increase in changing customer demands has resulted in factories transitioning rapidly and yielding shorter product life cycles. Traditional modeling and simulation approaches are not suited to handle such scenarios. As a possible solution, we propose a generic data-driven framework for automated generation of simulation models as basis for digital twins for smart factories. The novelty of our proposed framework is in the data-driven approach that exploits advancements in machine learning and process mining techniques, as well as continuous model improvement and validation. The goal of the framework is to minimize and fully define, or even eliminate, the need for expert knowledge in the extraction of the corresponding simulation models. We illustrate our framework through a case study. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A Digital Twin Framework With Meta- and Transfer Learning for Scalable Multi-Machine Modeling and Optimization in Semiconductor Manufacturing
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Despite recent advances in Digital Twin (DT) technologies for semiconductor manufacturing, no existing research convincingly demonstrates a unified, rapidly scalable, and data-efficient DT framework that can effectively handle stringent multi-objective optimization under severe data scarcity. This absence of a comprehensive approach impedes widespread industry adoption, given the pressing need for flexible, universal solutions that rapidly adapt to diverse machines and processes. This study introduces MOODFG-MLTL, an innovative algorithm that integrates Meta-Learning and Transfer Learning within a Multi-Objective Optimization using Deep-Feature Gaussian Processes (MOODFG) architecture. By harnessing a centralized meta-model repository and dynamically refining surrogate models, the proposed framework efficiently leverages limited data and transfers knowledge across heterogeneous manufacturing configurations. In our experimental validation with Epi SiC processes, MOODFG-MLTL achieves near-optimal wafer thickness and doping control using only 15 samples-reducing data requirements by approximately 50% while converging up to 40% faster compared to conventional approaches. Experimental validation in epitaxial silicon carbide (Epi SiC) scenarios demonstrates that the MOODFG-MLTL not only maintains robust performance under constrained data conditions but also accelerates the deployment of data-efficient, multi-objective DT solutions. This advancement provides a critical foundation for achieving universal, intelligent DT implementations in the semiconductor industry's evolving landscape.

TI  - Product Innovation Design Process Model Based on Functional Genes Extraction and Construction
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - The product innovation design is an innovation-intensive process that requires abundant knowledge and design experience, even across industries and disciplines, as a resource for problem solving. Therefore, designers need to have a good command of more design knowledge in this process. However, due to varied expressions of design knowledge (function, principle, structure) in different fields lead to the difficulty in representation of design knowledge, which makes designers unable to innovate by directly using design knowledge. Therefore, to solve the problem above, this paper, analogous to biological gene, proposes a product innovation process model based on functional gene extraction and construction. The proposed process model normalizes design knowledge through functional genes and help designers acquire design knowledge in different fields, which further promotes the product innovation design. The process model consists of four following steps. First, Obtain the overall function of product based on user needs and decompose it. Second, Build the functional gene model based on digital twin ones to expand the breadth of design knowledge and facilitate the retrieval. Third, Screen similar functional gene by the functional similarity algorithm. Finally, Obtain the design scheme through recombination, transcription, and translation of the functional gene. The feasibility of the research method is verified by using a shared bicycle parking device as an example.

TI  - Application of Modeling and Simulation in a Self-Reprogrammable Prototype of a Manufacturing System
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Shorter product life cycles and the growing demand for mass customization have led to the development of complex production systems, which are crucial for maintaining competitiveness. In this context, digital technologies and simulation tools play a fundamental role in integrating virtual and physical systems to enhance operational performance. This study presents a prototype for self-programming manufacturing systems, achieved through the integration of computer simulation and production management tools, leveraging the Digital Twin (DT) concept. To validate this approach, a prototype capable of interacting with a simulation model was developed. In the event of a failure that compromises product delivery conditions, the simulation model is activated to reprogram the production system's operating parameters, ensuring compliance with initial production requirements and minimizing the impact of disruptions. The tests confirmed effective data exchange between the physical and virtual environments. Additionally, intentional failures were introduced in the real environment to assess system behavior. Each time a failure occurred, the simulation model generated new operating parameters, adjusting the working speed in the real environment and thereby maintaining the production system's ability to meet its requirements. Consolidating the application of self-reprogramming.

TI  - Digital twins in healthcare: State of the art and potential use cases in a hospital setting
T2  - M S-MEDECINE SCIENCES
AB  - The field of modeling and simulation including digital twins (DT) is getting a lot of traction in the health sector, with various benefits being outlined. Indeed, DT are designed to support the transformation of healthcare, ranging from the medical act itself to the organization of healthcare systems and hospitals, also including medical research. However, the technology is still in its infancy and needs to be evaluated according to medical standards. First and foremost, their clinical value remains to be assessed, taking into account the limits associated with AI tools. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the use cases being tested in hospital settings. We go back to the definition of the DT concept and provide a summary of current studies. Finally, we outline the challenges to be taken into account in order to provide a framework for the deployment of DT tools, guaranteeing the trust and safety of those involved, especially of patients.

TI  - A digital-twin and rapid optimization framework for optical design of indoor farming systems
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL MECHANICS
AB  - In the face of a changing climate and a rising number of "food deserts" in both rural and urban areas, there is a demand to supply fresh produce year-round to communities at the end of the traditional agriculture supply chain. Vertical indoor farming is a promising mode of next-generation agriculture that boasts reduced water and pesticide usage, improved yields, more consistent quality, year-round cultivation, and cheaper transportation and harvesting costs. Indoor farms can rival industrial greenhouses in size, but small-scale "pod farms" can be deployed to smaller communities and areas where large swaths of land are either unavailable or too costly. These pods are often the size of shipping containers with their temperature, humidity, and plant nutrient supply carefully controlled. Plants inside the pods are grown hydroponically with light supplied by panels of LEDs and, thus, this mode of farming is fundamentally different from greenhouse farming. Many indoor farming pods have recently become commercially available claiming high energy efficiency, but little analysis and optimization work has been done to prove these claims. To drive innovation in the design of these physical systems, we have developed a digital-twin and genomic optimization framework for the optical design of vertical indoor farming pods. We model a completely enclosed indoor farming pod with plants in the three mutually-orthogonal planes and illuminated by LED "walls." We employ ray-tracing methods and a genetic algorithm to determine the LED source tube area size, beam aperture spread, and power requirements for maximal power absorption by the plants.

TI  - Agile, continuous building energy modeling and simulation
T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Digital twins have emerged as highly valuable tools for model-based planning, simulation and optimization over the last couple of years, thereby demonstrating considerable potential for application within the construction industry. The introduction of building information modeling (BIM) has effectively established a standardized approach to representing building models. However, in practice, many of these models currently exhibit limitations as to their quality, specifically concerning the level of detail they encompass. In addition, BIM models too often are locked inside a specific vendor's tool which readily implies a lack of platform independence, or interoperability, which, however, is essential for facilitating single and regressive, i.e., after a design change, model-based building performance simulations. Model-based engineering has effectively addressed comparable challenges within the domain of software engineering over the past decades by facilitating the integration and interoperability of models from various origins, by capitalizing on model-based tool integration. Prompted by these advantages, this study introduces a model-based tool environment that addresses the aforesaid challenges concerning BIM model quality and interoperability. Taking advantage of our proposed model-based tool environment, we implement an agile, continuous planning process for regressive, model-based building performance simulations, thereby enhancing building energy efficiency planning.

TI  - Image-based isogeometric twins of lattices with virtual image correlation for varying cross-section beams
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING
AB  - Cellular materials, in particular metal or polymer foams and beam lattices, are characterized by a complex architecture where the material is concentrated in slender struts. This study is concerned with the construction of numerically efficient sample-specific digital twin for the analysis and characterization of the mechanical behavior of such meta-materials. A method to build an explicit, light, and analysis-suitable isogeometric beam model directly from digital images is proposed. More precisely, as a main contribution, the virtual image correlation method is extended to the case of multiple interconnected beams with varying cross-sections. Special care is also given to the initialization for better efficiency and robustness. Synthetic and real examples of increasing complexity, that is, curved beams, lattices, and foams, are presented to account for the performance of the developed workflow from digital images to an isogeometric twin for mechanical modeling and simulation.

TI  - A versatile volume-based modeling technique of distributed local quadratic convergence for aeroengines
T2  - PROPULSION AND POWER RESEARCH
AB  - For advanced aero -engine design and research, modeling and simulation in a digital environment is indispensable, especially for engines of complicated con figurations, such as variable cycle engines (VCE) and adaptive cycle engines (ACE). Also, in the research of future smart engines, reliable real -time digital twins are paramount. However, the 2 dominant methods that used in solving the simulation models, Newton-Raphson (N -R) method and volume -based method, are not fully quali fied for the study requirements, because neither of them reaches the satisfactory balance of convergence rate and calculating efficiency. In this study, by deeply analyzing the mathematical principle of these 2 methods, a novel modeling and solving method for aero -engine simulation, which integrates the advantages of both N -R and volume -based methods, is established. It has distributed architecture and local quadratic convergence rate. And a novel modeling method for variable area bypass injectors (VABI) is put forward. These facilitate simulation of various con figurations of aero-engines. The modeling cases, including a high bypass -ratio (BPR) turbofan and an ACE, illustrate that the novel technique decreases the iterations by about two-thirds comparing with volume -based method, while the success rate of convergence remains over 99%. This proves its superiority in both convergence and calculating efficiency over the conventional ones. This technique can be used in advanced gas turbine engine design and control strategy optimization, and study of digital twins.

TI  - Analyzing Consultancy on Production Systems Based on the Digital Triplet Concept
T2  - MACHINES
AB  - This study aims to analyze the process flow of skilled consultants who utilize production improvement know-how and digital technology to enhance production systems in external companies. The concept of a Digital Triplet (D3), which expands the authors' Digital Twin framework to include the intelligent activity world, is adopted as it aligns with this study's objective. Given the complexity of the problems faced by production system consulting and the resulting inadequacy of reusing decision-making processes of skilled engineers based on the Generalized Process Model (GPM) using D3, a production system consulting modeling method is proposed. This method incorporates the Generalized Production System Consulting Process Model (GCPM) to generalize the production system consulting process. Using the proposed method, a case study focusing on energy-saving improvements was conducted to describe and analyze the consulting process of skilled consultants. The results show that the proposed method effectively captures the process flow of skilled consultants while considering the iterative structure of the GCPM. Additionally, utilizing the GCPM enables a comprehensive view of the entire process, facilitating an understanding of how knowledge and tools are utilized in various contexts.

TI  - Challenges in Geometry Assurance of Megacasting in the Automotive Industry
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING
AB  - Megacasting is a new concept in the automotive industry. A large number of sheet metal parts will be replaced with one large aluminum casting, i.e., a megacasting. This helps to reduce weight, opens up for larger design flexibility, allows for a more circular production, and takes away a large number of assembly steps in the production process. However, there are also challenges related to the use of megacastings. This position paper outlines challenges associated with the geometrical quality of the final product. It covers robust design and tolerancing in early product development phases as well as inspection preparation during pre-production and digital twin setup during full production to ensure the geometrical quality of a product containing a megacasting. Simulations of both part-level and assembly-level deviation and variation are discussed. The paper outlines a geometry assurance process for products containing megacastings in the automotive industry, and what research challenges that are the most important ones to address in this area. It is concluded that computer-aided tolerancing tools must be able to predict the dimensional effects from joining methods such as flow-drill fasteners or self-pierced riveting, to use casting simulation as input, and to handle combinations of solid and surface meshes. Furthermore, there might be a need for adjustments to the joining process based on digital twins to achieve proper quality at a reasonable price. Experiences in using megacastings in the body-in-white are lacking and a fast learning curve is required.

TI  - Challenges and promises of self-adaptive simulation models
T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The notion of (self-)adaptation, according to J. Holland (1975), describes the process of iterative refinement of an entity's behavior or structure to improve its performance in its environment. We argue that the potential role of (self-)adaptive simulation models has not been sufficiently acknowledged in the past. A focus on adaptive simulation will likely propel methodological advances in modeling and simulation and digital twinning, increasing its impact on solving urgent real-world problems. Therefore, we will review methods for including adaptation as part of or within simulation models and consequently discuss how simulation models themselves may become the subject of adaptation within and across simulation studies. We will identify different motivations for and types of adaptations within simulation studies by analyzing a family of simulation models. The need to automatically conduct various types of adaptations increases with the importance of online adaptations, e.g. as encountered in digital twins. Further methodological developments in unambiguously representing and intelligently processing the various knowledge sources used in simulation studies, domain-specific languages, analysis methods, self-adaptive software, and, last but not least, model learning are needed. Combining the adaptation within and of simulation models, we arrive at the vision of self-adaptive models, which are less subject to adaptation but become the central actors in their adaptation.

TI  - Ontology-Based Production Simulation with OntologySim
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Imagine the possibility to save a simulation at any time, modify or analyze it, and restart again with exactly the same state. The conceptualization and its concrete manifestation in the implementation OntologySim is demonstrated in this paper. The presented approach of a fully ontology-based simulation can solve current challenges in modeling and simulation in production science. Due to the individualization and customization of products and the resulting increase in complexity of production, a need for flexibly adaptable simulations arises. This need is exemplified in the trend towards Digital Twins and Digital Shadows. Their application to production systems, against the background of an ever increasing speed of change in such systems, is arduous. Moreover, missing understandability and human interpretability of current approaches hinders successful, goal oriented applications. The OntologySim can help solving this challenge by providing the ability to generate truly cyber physical systems, both interlocked with reality and providing a simulation framework. In a nutshell, this paper presents a discrete-event-based open-source simulation using multi-agency and ontology.

TI  - Benefits and Limitations of Artificial Neural Networks in Process Chromatography Design and Operation
T2  - PROCESSES
AB  - Due to the progressive digitalization of the industry, more and more data is available not only as digitally stored data but also as online data via standardized interfaces. This not only leads to further improvements in process modeling through more data but also opens up the possibility of linking process models with online data of the process plants. As a result, digital representations of the processes emerge, which are called Digital Twins. To further improve these Digital Twins, process models in general, and the challenging process design and development task itself, the new data availability is paired with recent advancements in the field of machine learning. This paper presents a case study of an ANN for the parameter estimation of a Steric Mass Action (SMA)-based mixed-mode chromatography model. The results are used to exemplify, discuss, and point out the effort/benefit balance of ANN. To set the results in a wider context, the results and use cases of other working groups are also considered by categorizing them and providing background information to further discuss the benefits, effort, and limitations of ANNs in the field of chromatography.

TI  - New Scale-Up Technologies for Multipurpose Pharmaceutical Production Plants: Use Case of a Heterogeneous Hydrogenation Process
T2  - ORGANIC PROCESS RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Minimizing the effort associated with the pilot and laboratory-scaleexperiments needed for a successful scale-up of a process from laboratoryto production scale is a significant challenge in process development.Efficient scale-up is becoming increasingly important in process developmentdue to the growing pressure to reduce costs and timelines while achievinga first-time-right approach. This article describes innovative technologiesthat enable direct and efficient process scale-up from the laboratoryto production scale, while concurrently optimizing scale-dependentparameters through in-depth process understanding. Those technologiesinclude a dynamic process model (based on a digital twin) and a laboratory-scaleimitation (Scale-Down-Reactor) of a specific production-scale reactor(4000 L). The core component of the Scale-Down-Reactor is a 3D-printedmetallic insert (H/C-Finger), designed to replicate the heat transferbehavior of the production reactor by maintaining a similar heat transfercoefficient and surface-to-volume ratio. In order to maintain comparablegas-liquid mass transfer between the scales, the Scale-Down-Reactorwas designed with geometric similarity to its large-scale counterpart.Both mass transfer and heat transfer were experimentally evaluatedfor the two scales, and the comparison demonstrated an excellent agreement.To finally prove and validate the concept, a hydrogenation processcurrently running at the production scale was conducted in the Scale-Down-Reactor.As a second technology, a dynamic process model is described thatincludes a kinetic model of the chemical reactions and a heat/masstransfer model (digital twin) of the aforementioned production-scalereactor. For the gas-liquid mass transfer model, an improvedmathematical description (equation) was developed. Moreover, the production-scalehydrogenation process conditions were efficiently optimized usingthe dynamic process model. The measured reaction mixture temperatureprofile of the optimized production batch demonstrated excellent agreementwith the profile predicted by the dynamic process model. By enablingdirect and efficient process scale-up while concurrently optimizingscale-dependent parameters, the technologies described within thisarticle offer a promising approach to reducing costs and timelineswhile improving process understanding.

TI  - Creating artificial societies for policy decision support: a research agenda and call to action
T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The enormous complexity of political decisions, especially with regard to crisis situations, requires innovative concepts for decision support. The focus here is always on people's well-being. Artificial societies based on agent-based simulation models are a fairly new, forward-looking paradigm for this. Digital twins, on the contrary, are one of the most promising enabling technologies for realizing a seamless integration between the virtual and the physical or biological world. In this paper, we propose an architecture that combines these two concepts to develop a research agenda to address research topics that will allow us to provide more effective decision support systems. We reflect on the current state of development in this area and formulate possible future research directions. A particular focus here is on integrating generative artificial intelligence (AI) methods and supporting cross-disciplinary collaboration, as decision support in the political environment is a highly cross-domain task. We conclude this article with a call for action to gain experience with the proposed architecture. We hope that this will encourage greater cross-disciplinary exchange for this important task.

TI  - Integrating AI and DTs: challenges and opportunities in railway maintenance application and beyond
T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
AB  - In the last years, there has been a growing interest in the emerging concept of digital twin (DT) as it represents a promising paradigm to continuously monitor cyber-physical systems, as well as to test and validate predictability, safety, and reliability aspects. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) is exponentially affirming as an extremely powerful tool when it comes to modeling the behavior of physical assets allowing, de facto, the possibility of making predictions on their potential evolution. However, despite the fact that DTs and AI (and their combination) can act as game-changing technologies in different domains (including the railways), several challenges have to be faced to ensure their effectiveness, especially when dealing with safety-critical systems. This paper provides a narrative review of the scientific literature on DTs for railway maintenance applications, with a special focus on their relationship with AI. The aim is to discuss the opportunities the integration of these two technologies could open in railway maintenance applications (and beyond), while highlighting the main challenges that should be overcome for its effective implementation.

AB  - By analyzing the feasibility of the digital twin technology in the assembly of construction machinery, the assembly process of the construction manipulator in the engineering environment is discussed. According to the application criteria and modeling requirements of digital twin, the overall framework of digital twin engineering manipulator assembly modeling and simulation is constructed from three aspects: model layer, data layer, and application layer. According to the operation task characteristics of space engineering manipulator, the feasibility of the control method based on joint angular velocity is analyzed, and the task environment of space engineering manipulator based on Markov model is defined. Aiming at the application of the algorithm in the control task of the space engineering manipulator, a reward function with the addition of the angular velocity soft bound term is designed, which improves the strategy optimization process of the algorithm and obtains a better control effect of the engineering manipulator. The motion trajectory of the end of the engineering manipulator is directly given on the simulation platform, and the expected motion of each joint of the engineering manipulator is calculated through the kinematics of the engineering manipulator. It can be seen from the simulation results that the controllers designed in this study can achieve ideal control effects. With the help of Baxter robot platform, the control algorithm designed in this study is applied to the actual engineering manipulator control, and the effectiveness of the control algorithm is further proved by the actual control effect.

AB  - and system behavior. The computational efficiency gained using such twins is critical for real-time machine monitoring and diagnostics with timely and interactive human intervention. One of the fundamental challenges in the current data-driven digital twins is a lack of understanding of how different data synthesis strategies of the same sensor data affect the predictive power of the twin models typically obtained through statistical learning. As a result, the interactive support for enabling human intervention and machine health monitoring is not generalized for different machine configurations and fault conditions. Using turbomachinery as a concrete demonstrative context, we investigate two fundamentally different data synthesis strategies, namely, integrated and combinatorial, as digital twins for a rotating machine. Specifically, we consider a rotor kit as a machine component, develop a synthetic dataset using simulations, and conduct systematic studies on the predictive performance of reduced-order models trained using the different data synthesis strategies. Our experiments show that the combinatorial dataset offers higher prediction accuracy in comparison to randomized data generation. Moreover, we created a cloud- based augmented reality (AR) mobile tool to show the feasibility of our methodology in developing potential machine monitoring applications with human-in-the-loop components.

TI  - Digital Design of the Crystallization of an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Using a Population Balance Model with a Novel Size Dependent Growth Rate Expression. From Development of a Digital Twin to In Silico Optimization and Experimental Validation
T2  - CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN
AB  - Prediction and control of the product properties in crystallization processes are practical challenges in the pharmaceutical industry. Effective crystallization process design and operation techniques are needed to meet the critical quality attributes (CQAs) and minimize batch-to-batch variation. Mathematical modeling can enhance process understanding and save a considerable amount of time, effort and raw material when used in process development following the guidelines of the Quality-by-Design (QbD) framework. When the mathematical model of the process is fitted and validated with experimental data, it provides a digital twin of the process that enables execution of in silico design of experiments (DoEs), which is particularly beneficial when the number of factors increases or if the material is expensive or sparingly available, e.g., during early stage development. This work presents the benefits of crystallization process modeling by studying an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) from Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., referred hereafter as Compound A. A framework for crystallization model construction, parameter estimation and validation are demonstrated through the case study of Compound A by using the population balance modeling (PBM) approach. Secondary nucleation, size dependent growth (SDG), and size dependent dissolution mechanisms are considered. Size dependency is introduced with a new formulation capturing the considerably slower growth of small crystals (D-90 < 10 mu m) while having size dependency for the larger crystal size domain (D-90 > 200 mu m) similar to the models from the literature. To make the model parameter estimation more industrially relevant, a novel method developed recently by the authors is applied to use the focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) data directly in the parameter estimation without further transformations. The kinetic parameters are estimated by minimizing the difference between measured and simulated concentrations, crystal size distributions (CSDs) and maximizing the correlation between the simulated crystal number density and measured FBRM counts. The paper also illustrates that the novel SDG rate expression can capture the CSD dynamics considerably better than the standard SDG rate models. The digital twin is used for in silico DoE and process optimization, and the simulation results are validated experimentally, demonstrating the benefits of model-based digital design for crystallization process development.

TI  - Physics-informed neural networks to solve lumped kinetic model for chromatography process
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
AB  - Numerical method is widely used for solving the mechanistic models of chromatography process, but it is timeconsuming and hard to response in real-time. Physics-informed neural network (PINN) as an emerging technology combines the structure of neural network with physics laws, and is getting noticed for solving physics problems with a balanced accuracy and calculation speed. In this research, a proof-of-concept study was carried out to apply PINN to chromatography process simulation. The PINN model structure was designed for the lumped kinetic model (LKM) with all LKM parameters. The PINN structure, training data and model complexity were optimized, and an optimal mode was obtained by adopting an in-series structure with a nonuniform training data set focusing on the breakthrough transition region. A PINN for LKM (LKM-PINN) consisting of four neural networks, 12 layers and 606 neurons was then used for the simulation of breakthrough curves of chromatography processes. The LKM parameters were estimated with two breakthrough curves and used to infer the breakthrough curves at different residence times, loading concentrations and column sizes. The results were comparable to that obtained with numerical methods. With the same raw data and constraints, the average fitting error for LKMPINN model was 0.075, which was 0.081 for numerical method. With the same initial guess, the LKM-PINN model took 160 s to complete the fitting, while the numerical method took 7 to 72 min, depending on the fitting settings. The fitting speed of LKM-PINN model was further improved to 30 s with random initial guess. Thus, the LKM-PINN model developed in this study is capable to be applied to real-time simulation for digital twin.

TI  - Parsimonious process model of energy retrofit of buildings
T2  - ORGANIZATION TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT IN CONSTRUCTION
AB  - Building information modelling (BIM) technology has been focusing on the creation, sharing and use of a comprehensive digital twin of the facility under construction or renovation. It is believed that a more comprehensive, structured and complete model would be better. The aim of this paper and the underlying research is to reaffirm the view that the essence of information is to inform the user and that the main purpose of information models is that they are informative that they contain the necessary information. Parsimonious information is information that is necessary but as simple as possible. Our hypothesis is that in many cases simpler models could be more useful, as they do not introduce technological barriers with the usually involved low- and medium-level contractors. One such case is the energy retrofitting of existing buildings. Many public and residential buildings with poor energy performance are located all over the world, especially in Eastern and Central Europe, as well as in China. They are an efficient target for a significant improvement in their energy performance by improving the building envelope and openings. The paper presents an economical process model for the modernisation of existing buildings. This model provides a basis for a parsimonious product model, which is currently under development. The broader objective of the research presented is to examine cases where a heavy information model may not be necessary and where a detailed process definition - as described in the BIM implementation plan and related documents - would lead to over-specification that would limit the free dynamics of a workflow.

TI  - Advanced data modeling for industrial drying machine energy optimization
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB  - In this article, a digital twin approach is proposed for modeling a pharmaceutical drying process using machine learning techniques, driven by data from different sensors captured in-line. The current difficulty with the drying process is mainly due to the manual operator control for choosing the end-point for terminating the drying step. This results in significant variability, depending on which human operator is supervising, and due to the multi-tasking nature of the job, generally allows a longer processing time to be sure the material is completely dry. The objective is to automate the end-point identification, thus optimizing the processing duration and therefore the overall energy consumption of the process. The point at which the drying is complete is indicated by the temperature difference between the ingoing and outgoing air flow. However, the stochastic nature of the process makes the data modeling a challenge. Firstly, a wide selection of supervised statistical and machine learning algorithms was benchmarked to find the one (CatBoost) which gave the best performance with the data. Next, the set of hyper-parameters was found for CatBoost which gave the optimum performance. This gave a best performance of 0.788 (R-2) fitting of the drying end-point prediction with the real values, for a large number of batches (over 700 K records). This is considered a good result taking into account the high residual of data models for these data and the stochastic nature of the process. The approach has been deployed in a real setting digital twin to control the drying process cutoff in the production plant. The results show the viability of the approach for modeling the process and automatically identifying the optimum end-point for the drying process, thus achieving significant energy savings which have been quantified as approximately 3.7 MWh per year for the pharmaceutical company.

TI  - Development of an Algorithm for Calculating the Moisture Content and Time of Forest Fire Maturation of Forest Combustible Materials for Determining Forest Fire Hazards
T2  - ELECTRONICS
AB  - Nowadays, forests play an important role in stabilizing the ecological balance, being one of the most important components of the biosphere. Due to the vital activity of forests, the gas composition of the atmosphere is normalized. Mass forest fires have the opposite effect. They cause irreparable damage to flora and fauna, contribute to the melting of Arctic ice, an increase in the Earth's temperature, and destabilization of the carbon balance. The purpose of this study is to develop an algorithm for calculating the moisture content and time of forest fire maturation of forest combustible materials. To achieve this goal, the main factors determining a forest fire hazard have been studied, as well as a review of existing methods for assessing forest fire danger and scientific papers on forest pyrology. As a result of the analysis of the research aimed at studying the rate of drying of forest combustible materials (FCM), depending on the physical properties and environmental parameters, a dependency of changes in moisture content over time was obtained. With its help, knowing the initial moisture content of FCM, it is possible to calculate the periods of fire maturation for each component of the forest plantation. Cooperative use of the resulting algorithm with a digital twin of a forest stand makes it possible to identify the most fire-hazard forest areas and estimate the period of their fire-prone maturation.

TI  - Towards Modelica Models with Credibility Information
T2  - ELECTRONICS
AB  - Modeling and simulation is increasingly used in the design process for a wide span of applications. Rising demands and the complexity of modern products also increase the need for models and tools capable to cover areas such as virtual testing, design-space exploration or digital twins, and to provide measures of the quality of the models and the achieved results. The latter is also called credible simulation process. In an article at the International Modelica Conference 2021, we summarized the state of the art and best practice from the viewpoint of a Modelica language user, based on the experience gained in projects in which Modelica models were utilized in the design process. Furthermore, missing features and gaps in the used processes were identified. In this article, new proposals are presented to improve the quality of Modelica models, in particular by adding traceability, uncertainty, and calibration information of the parameters in a standardized way to Modelica models. Furthermore, the new open-source Modelica library Credibility is discussed together with examples to support the implementation of credible Modelica models.

TI  - Structured validation of AI-based systems by virtual testing in simulated test scenarios
T2  - APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
AB  - The growing relevance of artificial intelligence (AI) for technical systems offers significant potential for the realization and operation of autonomous systems in complex and potentially unknown environments. However, unlike classical solution approaches, the functionality of an AI system cannot be verified analytically, which is why data-driven approaches such as scenario-based testing are used. With the increasing complexity of the required functionality of the AI-based system, the quantity, and quality of the data needed for development and validation also increase. To meet this demand, data generated synthetically using simulation is increasingly being used. Compared to the acquisition of real-world reference data, simulation offers the major advantage that it can be configured to test specific scenarios of interest. This paper presents an architecture for the systematic generation of virtual test scenarios to establish synthetically generated test data as an integral part of the development and validation process for AI systems. Key aspects of this architecture are the consistent use of digital twins as virtual 1-to-1 replicas and a simulation infrastructure that enables the generation of training and validation data for AI-based systems in appropriate quantity, quality, and time. In particular, this paper focuses on the application of the architecture in the context of two use cases from different application domains.

TI  - Industrial Agentic AI and generative modeling in complex systems
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Manufacturing, consumer, transportation, and supply chain processes present significant challenges in monitoring, control, and design due to their inherently nonlinear nature and the difficulty of measuring critical variables in real time. The convergence of major innovations from the computer science field has the potential to revolutionize the engineering and control of complex industrial systems. Digital twinning and process simulation have been a staple of computers in process engineering for decades now. However, the advent of advanced sensor systems and big data integration, combined with generative AI and agentified AI (classic and quantum) systems, allows for much more granular and autonomous process control and real-time optimization of complex systems. Advanced process modeling, Agentic AI, and generative AI models have emerged as powerful tools to address the challenges of complex nonlinear systems. We propose here an integrated systems feedback and control architecture (SIC: Sense, Infer, Control) that leverages complementary process knowledge for enhanced real-time monitoring and decision-making, fully integrated into control system functions and the accompanying sensors. In this paper, we explore this integration of generative models in agentic AI ensembles into industrial processes through the lens of four recent industrial case studies: (1) the real-time optimization of motorsports strategy, (2) the development of indirect (soft) sensors for sustainable large-scale manufacturing operations, (3) the creation of sensor data-driven personalized health and cosmetic chemical formulations, and (4) the design of biomanufacturing systems using quantum and classic Agentic AI. These examples demonstrate how agentic and generative models, combined with full-scale process simulation and digital twinning, effectively augment process control, enabling advanced solutions for process optimization, quality improvement, and sustainable operations. The proposed SIC systems architecture serves to enhance process control automation by capturing complex nonlinear patterns and leveraging easily measurable variables. Generative models bridge gaps in process understanding, sensor technologies, control, and monitoring, offering actionable insights for efficient and informed decision-making across diverse industrial applications.

TI  - Empowering Unskilled Production Systems Consultants through On-the-Job Training Support: A Digital Triplet Approach
T2  - SYSTEMS
AB  - This study aims to experimentally confirm whether knowledge that has been challenging to transfer through traditional on-the-job training (OJT) can be effectively transferred by introducing a formalized OJT approach that describes the improvement process knowledge of skilled production systems consultants, facilitating imitation by unskilled consultants. We adopted the Digital Triplet (D3) concept, an extension of the authors' digital twin framework to intelligent activities, aligning with our study objectives. Recognizing the difficulty and inadequacy of knowledge transfer in production systems consulting OJT, we propose an OJT support method integrating a decision-making modeling approach for skilled consultants' processes based on the Generalized Production Systems Consulting Process Model (GCPM) from prior literature into traditional OJT methods involving self-learning and direct instruction. This method enables the construction of a domain-specific GCPM, formalizing the improvement process flow implemented by skilled consultants and linking it to production improvement expertise and tools. In a case study focused on energy-saving improvement, we constructed and tested a domain-specific GCPM's efficacy in facilitating the transfer of difficult-to-transfer knowledge. The results indicate that domain-specific GCPM facilitates such knowledge transfer, including specialized improvement, knowledge utilization, rationale, and adaptation to specific cases.

TI  - A Petri Net-based framework for modeling and simulation of resource scheduling policies in Edge Cloud Continuum
T2  - SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY
AB  - The emergence of new technologies of 5G/6G networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) drives the transition from traditional Cloud Computing systems to the Edge Cloud Continuum - an interconnected distributed computing environment. Deploying modern applications in such a complex setting poses significant challenges for efficient dynamic resource management. Besides their several benefits, current orchestration platforms disregard aspects such as the dynamic behavior of applications' demands, heterogeneity of the infrastructure's resources, and the overall complexity when dealing with interdependent resource allocation decision parameters. The Digital Twin concept envisions assisting application deployments not only by providing offline simulations for experimental assessment in multi-cluster settings but also by actively guiding the orchestration process. In this paper, we aim to provide a modeling and simulation framework to optimize the performance of the underlying infrastructure in terms of resilience and sustainability. We investigate the application of automata theory to model such systems by analyzing their possible states, specifically, using Petri Nets, a mathematical framework for representing discrete event systems, as the primary modeling tool. Therefore, a comprehensive modeling approach is presented to simulate the resource scheduling decisions of an established multi-cluster framework, namely Karmada. Moreover, through this Petri Net modeling approach, we can efficiently optimize the performance of the orchestration process considering the power consumption and workload load balancing of a multi-cluster topology. Extensive evaluation indicates the efficacy of the proposed framework in accurately approximating Karmada's behavior for various scheduling policies. Also, the proposed framework is capable of assessing the performance of several scheduling policies and guiding the system towards efficient resource management in complex scenarios, exploiting the polynomial complexity of the Petri Net to identify scheduling states.

TI  - Investigation on the modeling and simulation of hydrodynamics in asymmetric conduction laser micro-welding of austenitic stainless steel and its process optimization
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART B-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANUFACTURE
AB  - Laser micro-welding is a joining technology utilized across various high-value industries, like medical, automotive, e-mobility, and aerospace. A trial-and-error process to identify welding parameters does not necessarily lead to optimized quality levels. Furthermore, offline non-destructive examination methods often launched to verify welding quality may inadvertently trigger excessive costs and time delays, ultimately failing to guarantee defect-free welds. In response to these challenges, this article introduces an advanced multiscale model designed to unravel the intricate dynamics of hydrodynamics and the overarching physics within laser micro-welding melting pools. Developed using the COMSOL software package, the model adeptly demonstrates how surface tension gradients shape the geometry of welds, thus influencing their quality. This knowledge allows the mapping of welding defects. One of the novelties of the article is to introduce geometric dissimilar welding conditions by simulating an asymmetric edge joint. It shows a study on a new, unstudied way to laser weld with many applications in the field. The model further establishes its utility in design experiments to determine parameter, tolerance, and system design. Moreover, the insights garnered from understanding and controlling these drivers have far-reaching implications for the advancement of subsequent methodological research and the development of in-situ quality control practices by characterizing the welding defects. Finally, the results shows that the discouragingly high computational costs restrict its potential application to support a Digital Twin.

TI  - VGEs as a New Platform for Urban Modeling and Simulation
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The complexity of interrelationships between urban natural environments and human environments is increasing with rapid urbanization. This brings new challenges to urban modeling and simulation in simultaneously meeting the comprehensive needs of the dual integration of data and models, multi-type visualizations, human-centered simulation, geographic collaboration, and interactions between physical and virtual spaces. We here propose virtual geographic environments (VGEs) as a new platform of urban modeling and simulation. After discussing the evolution, definition, and features of VGEs, we design a VGE framework for urban system modeling and simulation. Two typical cases are provided to illustrate how VGEs support urban modeling and simulation on different scales: VGE-based collaborative modeling and the simulation of air pollution dispersion in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) urban agglomeration, and fire emergency crowd evacuation simulation. In the future, VGEs may also play an important role in digital twin cities and urban metaverses.

TI  - Using Markov Decision Process Model for Sustainability Assessment in Industry 4.0
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - The manufacturing industry is facing increasing challenges to improve sustainability performance by using Industry 4.0 technologies like big data analytics, the internet of things, and digital twins, considering their potentials. However, effectively integrating sustainability goals and Industry 4.0 technologies within manufacturing systems can be challenging due to real-time attribute data of digital twins of machinery obtained by IoT tools and the necessity to integrate them into production planning levels. This challenge can be addressed by developing a framework for optimizing the flow of operations in a manufacturing system while incorporating sustainability assessment and Industry 4.0 technologies effectively. This paper investigates the integration of sustainability assessment considering Industry 4.0 technologies and the use of Markov Decision Process capabilities. The framework utilizes Markov Decision Process to model the decision-making process of the manufacturing system and its decision-makers. It includes sustainability goals as constraints or objectives in the Markov Decision Process model. The use of Industry 4.0 technologies is integrated into the framework to gather data and optimize the decision-making process based on that data. The capabilities of the proposed framework are demonstrated through case studies of a single agent on a shop floor. The findings from the case study indicate that the proposed framework can effectively support decision-making at the top-tier level of the enterprise by integrating sustainability assessment and the Industry 4.0 paradigm.

TI  - COVERT: A classless approach to generating balanced datasets for process modelling
T2  - ISA TRANSACTIONS
AB  - In this work, a classless oversampling technique, Covert, was developed to improve historical datasets from industrial processing plants to aid process modelling. Using kernel density estimation and nearest neighbour algorithms, sparse regions are identified and resampled, developing a more balanced dataset. When applied to a real dataset from a geothermal power plant, Covert outperforms current best practice (Smote) in uniformly populating the input feature space and generating credible data in the output variable. When used to develop a data -driven model Covert improved model accuracy by 20% when predicting outside the original data's feature space. Smote, however, reduced model accuracy by 6% in the same feature space. Developing reliable models of industrial processes continues to be a significant hurdle in developing a digital twin. Using Covert, existing imbalanced historical data can be used to extend the range of applicability of any process model.

TI  - Modeling and validation of a novel tracked robot via multibody dynamics
T2  - ROBOTICA
AB  - This article focuses on a multibody model of a new passive articulated suspension tracked robot. The model of the vehicle is developed using the multibody software MSC Adams (acronym for automatic dynamic analysis of mechanical systems) in conjunction with the Adams Tracked Vehicle toolkit. The various subsystems that make up the vehicle assembly are described, with particular attention to the modeling strategies of the swing arms that constitute the suspension system and the characterization of the track belt. The multibody model allows the system performance to be evaluated in advance for fine-tuning of the design parameters and using different configurations, for example, with active and locked suspension. Efforts are also presented to validate the multibody twin against the real prototype, showing a good agreement with field experiments. Once validated, the digital twin is used to assess the performance of the innovative suspension system in various challenging environments.

TI  - Process Modeling and Simulation of Tableting-An Agent-Based Simulation Methodology for Direct Compression
T2  - PHARMACEUTICS
AB  - In pharmaceutical manufacturing, the utmost aim is reliably producing high quality products. Simulation approaches allow virtual experiments of processes in the planning phase and the implementation of digital twins in operation. The industrial processing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) into tablets requires the combination of discrete and continuous sub-processes with complex interdependencies regarding the material structures and characteristics. The API and excipients are mixed, granulated if required, and subsequently tableted. Thereby, the structure as well as the properties of the intermediate and final product are influenced by the raw materials, the parametrized processes and environmental conditions, which are subject to certain fluctuations. In this study, for the first time, an agent-based simulation model is presented, which enables the prediction, tracking, and tracing of resulting structures and properties of the intermediates of an industrial tableting process. Therefore, the methodology for the identification and development of product and process agents in an agent-based simulation is shown. Implemented physical models describe the impact of process parameters on material structures. The tablet production with a pilot scale rotary press is experimentally characterized to provide calibration and validation data. Finally, the simulation results, predicting the final structures, are compared to the experimental data.

TI  - Accelerating Biologics Manufacturing by Modeling: Process Integration of Precipitation in mAb Downstream Processing
T2  - PROCESSES
AB  - The demand on biologics has been constantly rising over the past decades and has become crucial in modern medicine. Promising approaches to cope with widespread diseases like cancer and diabetes are gene therapy, plasmid DNA, virus-like particles, and exosomes. Due to progress that has been made in upstream processing (USP), difficulties arise in downstream processing and demand for innovative solutions. This work focuses on the integration of precipitation using a quality by design (QbD) approach for process development. Selective precipitation is achieved with PEG 4000 resulting in an HCP depletion of >= 80% respectively to IgG. Dissolution was executed with a sodium phosphate buffer (pH = 5/50 mM) reaching an IgG recovery of >= 95%. However, the central challenge in process development is still an optimal process design, which is transferable for a broad molecular variety of new products. This is where rigorous modeling becomes vital in order to generate digital twins to support early-stage process development and reduce the experimental overhead. Therefore, a model development and validation concept for construction of a process model for precipitation is also presented.

TI  - The Role of Virtual Reality Simulation in Manufacturing in Industry 4.0
T2  - SYSTEMS
AB  - From the first to the fourth industrial revolutions (4IR) or Industry 4.0 (i4.0), the manufacturing sector has always been at the forefront of innovation and digital technology adoption. However, 4IR or i4.0 comes with diverse and integrated technologies that tend to sweep off all the old orders. This study undertakes a science mapping of research on the role of virtual reality simulation (VRSIM) in manufacturing in the 4IR, which reveals several roles and benefits. The analysis of the conceptual structure of relevant literature highlights the contexts, applications, and relevance of VRSIM in the i4.0 era, including its potent role in predictive modeling and simulation, digital twin and predictive maintenance, additive manufacturing and 3D printing, and virtual manufacturing and immersive virtual digital factory simulation. VRSIM also offers a realistic virtual environment for mapping human-robot collaboration in different manufacturing environments, such as aircraft and automotive assembly lines, evaluating processes, training factory workers on safety, and assessing workers' ergonomics in digital production and operations. VRSIM in manufacturing offers active research activities, with increasing literature publications and impacts attracting core sources in industrial engineering, manufacturing systems, production and operations, and information technology.

TI  - Model Reduction Method for Spacecraft Electrical System Based on Singular Perturbation Theory
T2  - ELECTRONICS
AB  - Accurate and efficient modeling and simulation of spacecraft electrical systems are crucial because of their complexity. However, existing models often struggle to balance simulation efficiency and accuracy. This paper introduces a model reduction method based on singular perturbation theory to simplify the full-order model of spacecraft electrical systems. The experimental results show that the reduced-order simplified model saves 50% of the simulation time with almost no degradation in the simulation accuracy and can be applied to real-world scenarios, such as digital twins. This method offers a new approach for rapid simulation of spacecraft electrical systems and has broad application prospects.

TI  - Trajectory Predictions with Details in a Robotic Twin-Crane System
T2  - COMPLEX SYSTEM MODELING AND SIMULATION
AB  - Nowadays, more automated or robotic twin-crane systems (RTCSs) are employed in ports and factories to improve material handling efficiency. In a twin-crane system, cranes must travel with a minimum safety distance between them to prevent interference. The crane trajectory prediction is critical to interference handling and crane scheduling. Current trajectory predictions lack accuracy because many details are simplified. To enhance accuracy and lessen the trajectory prediction time, a trajectory prediction approach with details (crane acceleration/deceleration, different crane velocities when loading/unloading, and trolley movement) is proposed in this paper. Simulations on different details and their combinations are conducted on a container terminal case study. According to the simulation results, the accuracy of the trajectory prediction can be improved by 20%. The proposed trajectory prediction approach is helpful for building a digital twin of RTCSs and enhancing crane scheduling.

Three main classes of manufacturing processes used for the generation of engineering surfaces are considered: material removal processes, material conservative processes, and material additive processes. Types of modeling techniques for the simulation of surface generation are reviewed and discussed including analytical models, numerical multi-physics models, and data-driven methods. After presenting the application of those modeling techniques for the prediction of characteristics and geometry of surfaces generated by different manufacturing processes, their performance, implementation, and accuracy are discussed.

TI  - Modeling the Dynamics of Five-Axis Machine Tool Using the Multibody Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB  - A systematic modeling of multibody dynamics of five-axis machine tools is presented in this article. The machine is divided into major subassemblies such as spindle, column, bed, tool changer, and longitudinal and rotary drives. The inertias and mass center of each subassembly are calculated from the design model. The subassemblies are connected with elastic springs and damping elements at contact joints to form the complete multibody dynamic model of the machine that considers the rigid body kinematics and structural vibrations of the machine at any point. The unknown elastic joint parameters are estimated from the experimental modal analysis of the machine tool. The resulting position-dependent multibody dynamic model has the minimal number of degrees-of-freedom that is equivalent to the number of measured modes, as opposed to thousands used in finite element models. The frequency response functions of the machine can be predicted at any posture of the five-axis machine, which are compared against the directly measured values to assess the validity of model. The proposed model can predict the combined rigid body motion and vibrations of the machine with computational efficiency, and hence, it can be used as a digital twin to simulate its dynamic performance in machining operations and tracking control tests of the servo drives.

AB  - Baghouse filters applied for gas cleaning are subject to digitalization concepts, including process modeling and the development of digital twins in order to improve energy efficiency and lower particle emissions. Modeling equations from literature were adapted to match experimental data from part 1 of this study to calculate the effect of varying filter face velocities, dust concentrations, or tank pressures on energy demand and particle emissions. Based on the model approaches, an operation curve that enables the evaluation of filter operation regarding the trade-off between energy demand and particle emissions can be constructed. The identification of energetically optimal cycle times and favorable operation regions is possible due to the extensive experimental framework of the model.

TI  - Surrogate Model of Hydraulic Actuator for Active Motion Compensation Hydraulic Crane
T2  - ELECTRONICS
AB  - Offshore cranes equipped with active motion compensation (AMC) systems play a vital role in marine engineering tasks such as offshore wind turbine maintenance, subsea operations, and dynamic load positioning under wave-induced disturbances. These systems rely on complex hydraulic actuators whose strongly nonlinear dynamics-often described by differential-algebraic equations (DAEs)-impose significant computational burdens, particularly in real-time applications like hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation, digital twins, and model predictive control. To address this bottleneck, we propose a neural network-based surrogate model that approximates the actuator dynamics with high accuracy and low computational cost. By approximately reducing the original DAE model, we obtain a lower-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs) representation, which serves as the foundation for training. The surrogate model includes three hidden layers, demonstrating strong fitting capabilities for the highly nonlinear characteristics of hydraulic systems. Bayesian regularization is adopted to train the surrogate model, effectively preventing overfitting. Simulation experiments verify that the surrogate model reduces the solving time by 95.33%, and the absolute pressure errors for chambers p1 and p2 are controlled within 0.1001 MPa and 0.0093 MPa, respectively. This efficient and scalable surrogate modeling framework possesses significant potential for integrating high-fidelity hydraulic actuator models into real-time digital and control systems for offshore applications.

TI  - Automated framework for asphalt pavement design and analysis by integrating BIM and FEM
T2  - AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION
AB  - To address the inefficiencies in asphalt pavement modeling and the challenges of integrating design with structural calculations, an automated framework that connects Building Information Modeling (BIM) to the Finite Element Method (FEM) was proposed for evaluating asphalt pavement design solutions and verifying structural optimization. This framework enables precise interaction between BIM and FEM through material attribute assignment, high-quality meshing, application of environmental and load conditions, and rutting calculations. By collecting on-site road temperatures and material parameters and entering them into the BIM-FEM framework, the permanent deformation of the asphalt layer was calculated and the reliability of the framework was validated. Results indicate a simulation error of just 2.12 %, with efficiency improved by 68.66 % and accuracy enhanced by 54.89 % compared to recent research. The accuracy and efficiency of modeling and simulation in large-scale road engineering projects were significantly enhanced by this framework to support the digital twin management of road engineering.

TI  - Petri Net-Based Semi-Compiled Code Generation for Programmable Logic Controllers
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Industrial discrete event dynamic systems (DEDSs) are commonly modeled by means of Petri nets (PNs). PNs have the capability to model behaviors such as concurrency, synchronization, and resource sharing, compared to a step transition function chart or GRAphe Fonctionnel de Commande Etape Transition (GRAFCET) which is a particular case of a PN. However, there is not an effective systematic way to implement a PN in a programmable logic controller (PLC), and so the implementation of such a controller outside a PLC in some external software that will communicate with the PLC is very common. There have been some attempts to implement PNs within a PLC, but they are dependent on how the logic of places and transitions is programmed for each application. This work proposes a novel application-independent and platform-independent PN implementation methodology. This methodology is a systematic way to implement a PN controller within industrial PLCs. A great portion of the code will be validated automatically prior to PLC implementation. Net structure and marking evolution will be checked on the basis of PN model structural analysis, and only net interpretation will be manually coded and error-prone. Thus, this methodology represents a systematic and semi-compiled PN implementation method. A use case supported by a digital twin (DT) is shown where the automated solution required by a manufacturing system is carried out and executed in two different devices for portability testing, and the scan cycle periods are compared for both approaches.

TI  - PRODEC for human systems integration of increasingly autonomous systems
T2  - SYSTEMS ENGINEERING
AB  - The purpose of the PRODEC scenario-based design method is the incremental cross-fertilization and refinement of procedural scenarios and declarative configurations. It uses virtual prototypes of the developed systems (mainly life-critical systems) to conduct human-in-the-loop simulations (HITLSs). Based on human systems integration (HSI) principles and criteria, as well as expertise and experience in the domain at stake, this HSI approach grounded in virtual environments requires a clear definition of physical and cognitive tangibility metrics to assess the distance between virtual and tangible (grasp) dimensions of the system being developed when it is put to work. PRODEC considers human and machine systems described in terms of structures and functions incrementally designed using procedural scenarios (i.e., stories) in task and activity networks, which provide life to declarative configurations (i.e., system's functions and structures). This active modeling and simulation process enables the discovery of emergent structures and functions of the system being developed when it is virtually operated. PRODEC's use is illustrated in an example. We discuss the use of PRODEC and its results as to how they can be used with digital twins.

TI  - Expectations and limitations of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) for Advanced Manufacturing: A View from the Grinding Industry
T2  - FUTURE INTERNET
AB  - Grinding is a critical technology in the manufacturing of high added-value precision parts, accounting for approximately 20-25% of all machining costs in the industrialized world. It is a commonly used process in the finishing of parts in numerous key industrial sectors such as transport (including the aeronautical, automotive and railway industries), and energy or biomedical industries. As in the case of many other manufacturing technologies, grinding relies heavily on the experience and knowledge of the operatives. For this reason, considerable efforts have been devoted to generating a systematic and sustainable approach that reduces and eventually eliminates costly trial-and-error strategies. The main contribution of this work is that, for the first time, a complete digital twin (DT) for the grinding industry is presented. The required flow of information between numerical simulations, advanced mechanical testing and industrial practice has been defined, thus producing a virtual mirror of the real process. The structure of the DT comprises four layers, which integrate: (1) scientific knowledge of the process (advanced process modeling and numerical simulation); (2) characterization of materials through specialized mechanical testing; (3) advanced sensing techniques, to provide feedback for process models; and (4) knowledge integration in a configurable open-source industrial tool. To this end, intensive collaboration between all the involved agents (from university to industry) is essential. One of the most remarkable results is the development of new and more realistic models for predicting wheel wear, which currently can only be known in industry through costly trial-and-error strategies. Also, current work is focused on the development of an intelligent grinding wheel, which will provide on-line information about process variables such as temperature and forces. This is a critical issue in the advance towards a zero-defect grinding process.

T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Development of Embedded Real-Time Systems is prone to error, and developing bug-free applications is expensive and no guarantees can be provided. We introduce the concept of Digital Quadruplet which includes: a 3D virtual representation of the physical world (a Digital Twin), a Discrete-Event formal model of the system of interest (called the "Digital Triplet"), which can be used for formal analysis as well as simulation studies, and a physical model of the real system under study for experimentation (called the "Digital Quadruplet"). We focus on the definition of the idea of a Digital Quadruplet and how to make these four apparati consistent and reusable. To do so, we use the Discrete-Event formal model as a center for both simulation and execution of the real-time embedded components with timing constraints, as well as a common mechanism for interfacing with the digital counterparts, providing model continuity throughout the process. Here we focus on a principal part of the Digital Quadruplet idea: the provision of an environment to allow models to be used for simulation (in virtual time), visualization, or execution in real-time. A Discrete-EVent Systems specifications (DEVS) kernel runs on bare-metal hardware platforms, avoiding the use of an Operating RTOS in the platform, and the combination with discrete-event modeling engineering.

TI  - Transport System Digitalization in the Mining Industry
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The mining industry faces increasing pressure to improve efficiency, reduce operational costs, and adapt to modern technological trends. Central to these challenges is digitalization. This paper compares the level of digitalization in the mining industry internationally and in Slovakia, raising the question of the feasibility of implementing digitalization tools in small-scale Slovak mining operations. The presented case study demonstrates the creation of a simulation model and 3D animation for the development of small and medium-sized open pit mines, using Tecnomatix Plant Simulation software version 2302.0004, empirical data collection, and programming with SimTalk 2.0. Internationally, digitalization through modeling and simulation is already at a much higher level, with advanced solutions such as digital twins. In contrast, digitalization in Slovak mining operations is limited to basic simulation approaches, with only a few documented attempts, highlighting substantial opportunities for further development. The simulation model developed in this study enables more efficient planning and management of logistics and transportation processes, with potential benefits for operational improvements, safety, and sustainability. Adopting digitalization, even in small-scale operations, can drive the future development of the Slovak mining industry.

TI  - Scalable Sensor Models and Simulation Methods for Seamless Transitions Within System Development: From First Digital Prototype to Final Real System
T2  - IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL
AB  - Highly automated systems are taking over an increasing number of human tasks. This includes not only the execution of certain actions but also perception and interpretation of the environment. Here, environment-perceiving sensor systems such as camera, lidar, or radar represent a key technology while posing a major challenge in terms of complex physical interactions that make validation very complicated. Typically, required system tests within dynamic environments are enabled too late, while real-world testing is neither efficient nor sufficient. Striving for a seamless transition from a first digital prototype to the final real system, we propose the use of digital twins and hybrid testbeds. These combine real and simulated components per availability or requirement to continuously enable simulation-based validation in all stages of development. To this end, we present an overall concept of scalable sensor models and simulation methods that meet the varying requirements along the development process by introducing a triple-axis scalability. Here, reusable building blocks allow for scaling across different sensor types and applications with varying level of detail, while natural interfaces and measurement-accurate ground truth annotators ensure a seamless integration into the underlying development process using methods of X-in-the-loop.

TI  - Multi-Objective Optimization of Building Ventilation Systems Using Model Predictive Control: Integrating Air Quality, Energy Cost, and Environmental Impact
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - This paper presents a flexible heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) modeling framework developed for building digital twin implementation. The framework is showcased for the modeling and simulation of four ventilation systems in a 8500 m2 university building. The developed model includes multiple objective model predictive control (MPC) with three objectives: electricity cost, indoor air quality and CO2 emission attributed to electricity consumption. A control strategy comparison is conducted between several MPC solutions with different objective weightings and a rule-based control strategy, which emulates the current system control. A novel approach for air quality evaluation is proposed and used for the MPC modeling and strategy comparison in this study. In this comparison, a "balanced" MPC strategy reduces energy costs by 18% compared to rule-based control while also providing significantly better air quality. An economic strategy achieves 24% savings with some air quality reduction, while an air-quality-focused strategy provides nearly "perfect" air quality with 11% savings. Finally, an environmental strategy shows the potential for prioritizing CO2 emissions over electricity costs. In this way, the strategy comparison illustrates the potential of MPC for the efficient operation and flexible objective prioritization according to stakeholder interests.

TI  - Modeling and Simulation of a Real Lime Kiln Plant to Understand Ring Formation Phenomena
T2  - PROCESSES
AB  - This paper presents a study on the ring formation phenomenon in lime kilns using simulation. The research focuses on the chemical recovery cycle integrated into the pulp production process at a pulp mill, with particular emphasis on the calcium cycle within the lime kilns. Lime kilns are critical components, as their unavailability can significantly impact the overall cost-effectiveness of the facility. The calcination of lime sludge occurs in a rotary kiln, where calcium carbonate in the lime sludge is converted into calcium oxide (lime). Under certain conditions, material can progressively accumulate, leading to ring formation and eventual kiln clogging, resulting in operational downtime. To investigate this issue, the authors developed a physics-based model using a finite-dimensional, one-dimensional approach that considers only longitudinal variation. Several approximations were made to maintain a reasonable simulation time without compromising accuracy. Simulations based on real operational data identified fluctuations in fuel flow rate and sulfur content from non-condensable gases as key contributors to ring formation. The results showed that these fluctuations caused instability in the temperature profiles of the solids and gas beds, leading to periods of cooling before the lime sludge reaches the outlet to the coolers. This cooling promotes the recarbonation of lime and, consequently, the formation of rings. The findings highlight that stabilizing fuel flow and managing sulfur content could mitigate ring formation and improve kiln efficiency. The developed model provides a valuable tool for predictive analysis and process optimization, potentially supporting the development of a digital twin to enhance real-time monitoring and operational control.

TI  - Methods for lithium-based battery energy storage SOC estimation. Part II: Application and accuracy
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Climate change is driving the transformation of energy systems from fossil to renewable energies. In industry, power supply systems and electro-mobility, the need for electrical energy storage is rising sharply. Lithium-based batteries are one of the most widely used technologies. Operating parameters must be determined to control the storage system within the approved operating limits. Operating outside the limits, i.e., exceeding or falling below the permitted cell voltage, can lead to faster aging or destruction of the cell. Accurate cell information is required for optimal and efficient system operation. The key is high-precision measurements, sufficiently accurate battery cell and system models, and efficient control algorithms. Increasing demands on the efficiency and dynamics of better systems require a high degree of accuracy in determining the state of health and state of charge (SOC). These scientific contributions to the above topics are divided into two parts. In the first part of the paper, a holistic overview of the main SOC assessment methods is given. Physical measurement methods, battery modeling, and the methodology of using the model as a digital twin of a battery are addressed and discussed. In addition, adaptive methods and artificial intelligence methods that are important for SOC calculation are presented. Part two of the paper presents examples of the application areas and discusses their accuracy.

TI  - Real time uncertainty estimation in filling stage of resin transfer molding process
T2  - POLYMER COMPOSITES
AB  - This paper addresses the development of a digital twin, based on an inversion procedure, integrating process monitoring with simulation of composites manufacturing to provide a real time probabilistic estimation of process outcomes. A computationally efficient surrogate model was developed based on Kriging. The surrogate model reduces the computational time allowing inversion in real time. The tool was implemented in the filling stage of an resin transfer molding processing of a carbon fiber reinforced part resulting in the probabilistic prediction of unknown parameters. Flow monitoring data were acquired using dielectric sensors. The inverse scheme based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo uses input parameters, such as permeability and viscosity, as unknown stochastic variables. The scheme enhances the model by reducing model parameter uncertainty yielding an accurate on line estimation of process outcomes and critical events such as racetracking. The inverse scheme provides a prediction of filling duration with an error of about 5% using information obtained within the first 30% of the process.

TI  - PolyVerif: An Open-Source Environment for Autonomous Vehicle Validation and Verification Research Acceleration
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Validation and Verification (V&V) of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based cyber physical systems such as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is currently a vexing and unsolved problem. AVs integrate subsystems in areas such as detection, sensor fusion, localization, perception, and path planning. Each of these subsystems contains significant AI content integrated with traditional hardware and software components. The complexity for validating even a subsystem is daunting and the task of validating the whole system is nearly impossible. Fundamental research in advancing the state-of-the-art for AV V&V is required. However, for V&V researchers, it is exceedingly difficult to make progress because of the massive infrastructure requirements to demonstrate the viability of any solution. This paper presents PolyVerif, the world's first open-source solution focused on V&V researchers with the objective of accelerating the state-of-the-art for AV V&V research. PolyVerif provides an AI design and verification framework consisting of a digital twin creation process, an open-source AV engine, access to several open-source physics based simulators, and open-source symbolic test generation engines. PolyVerif's objective is to arm V&V researchers with a framework which extends the state-of-the-art on any one of the many major axes of interest and use the remainder of the infrastructure to quickly demonstrate the viability of their solution. Given its open-source nature, researchers can also contribute their innovations to the project. Using this critical property of open-source environments, the innovation rate of the whole research community to solve these vexing issues can be greatly accelerated. Finally, the paper also presents results from several projects which have used PolyVerif.

TI  - Agent-based modeling and simulation for 5G and beyond networks : A comprehensive survey
T2  - SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY
AB  - Modeling and simulation of telecommunication networks have captivated significant interdisciplinary attention, notably since the release of the fifth-generation (5G) technology and the heavy public interest associated with its Non-Standalone (NSA) and eventual Standalone (SA) architecture deployment. However, 5G and beyond (5G+) network simulation is rather challenging as the complexity of networks has massively multiplied, given the manifold network intricacies demanded by stringent 5G requirements like mobile mmWave, Massive Multiple Input Multiple-Output (MIMO), Advanced Channel Coding, and more. Furthermore, the arrival of 5G marks a turning point in the evolution of mobile networks as it progresses towards the softwarization of networks and paves the path for future Artificial Intelligence (AI) native 6G and beyond networks. Consequently, classical simulation techniques have a high risk of becoming insufficient to model the demands of such drastically changing network dynamics, prompting researchers to view 5G+ networks from the perspective of Complex System Science (CSS). We move in that direction as we shed light on Agent-based modeling and simulation as a pragmatic and powerful tool to model 5G+ communication networks. Our approach involves a comprehensive survey of Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) and 5G+ networks, utilizing its insights to dissect the advantages, potential, and challenges of ABS in the context of 5G+ networks. Through proposing a prospective architecture for a simulator and its envisioned evolution into a Digital Twin (DT), we not only offer insights into the lessons learned but also chart out future research pathways in the flourishing domain of 5G+ modeling and simulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature that tackles the complexities of modeling and simulating 5G+ networks, by adopting an ABS approach.

TI  - ImageMech: From Image to Particle Spring Network for Mechanical Characterization
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MATERIALS
AB  - The emerging demand for advanced structural and biological materials calls for novel modeling tools that can rapidly yield high-fidelity estimation on materials properties in design cycles. Lattice spring model , a coarse-grained particle spring network, has gained attention in recent years for predicting the mechanical properties and giving insights into the fracture mechanism with high reproducibility and generalizability. However, to simulate the materials in sufficient detail for guaranteed numerical stability and convergence, most of the time a large number of particles are needed, greatly diminishing the potential for high-throughput computation and therewith data generation for machine learning frameworks. Here, we implement CuLSM, a GPU-accelerated compute unified device architecture C++ code realizing parallelism over the spring list instead of the commonly used spatial decomposition, which requires intermittent updates on the particle neighbor list. Along with the image-to-particle conversion tool Img2Particle, our toolkit offers a fast and flexible platform to characterize the elastic and fracture behaviors of materials, expediting the design process between additive manufacturing and computer-aided design. With the growing demand for new lightweight, adaptable, and multi-functional materials and structures, such tailored and optimized modeling platform has profound impacts, enabling faster exploration in design spaces, better quality control for 3D printing by digital twin techniques, and larger data generation pipelines for image-based generative machine learning models.

TI  - Process Model Inversion in the Data-Driven Engineering Context for Improved Parameter Sensitivities
T2  - PROCESSES
AB  - Industry 4.0 has embraced process models in recent years, and the use of model-based digital twins has become even more critical in process systems engineering, monitoring, and control. However, the reliability of these models depends on the model parameters available. The accuracy of the estimated parameters is, in turn, determined by the amount and quality of the measurement data and the algorithm used for parameter identification. For the definition of the parameter identification problem, the ordinary least squares framework is still state-of-the-art in the literature, and better parameter estimates are only possible with additional data. In this work, we present an alternative strategy to identify model parameters by incorporating differential flatness for model inversion and neural ordinary differential equations for surrogate modeling. The novel concept results in an input-least-squares-based parameter identification problem with significant parameter sensitivity changes. To study these sensitivity effects, we use a classic one-dimensional diffusion-type problem, i.e., an omnipresent equation in process systems engineering and transport phenomena. As shown, the proposed concept ensures higher parameter sensitivities for two relevant scenarios. Based on the results derived, we also discuss general implications for data-driven engineering concepts used to identify process model parameters in the recent literature.

TI  - Leveraging Historical Process Data for Recombinant P. pastoris Fermentation Hybrid Deep Modeling and Model Predictive Control Development
T2  - FERMENTATION-BASEL
AB  - Hybrid modeling techniques are increasingly important for improving predictive accuracy and control in biomanufacturing, particularly in data-limited conditions. This study develops and experimentally validates a hybrid deep learning model predictive control (MPC) framework for recombinant P. pastoris fed-batch fermentations. Bayesian optimization and grid search techniques were employed to identify the best-performing hybrid model architecture: an LSTM layer with 2 hidden units followed by a fully connected layer with 8 nodes and ReLU activation. This design balanced accuracy (NRMSE 4.93%) and computational efficiency (AICc 998). This architecture was adapted to a new, smaller dataset of bacteriophage Q beta coat protein production using transfer learning, yielding strong predictive performance with low validation (3.53%) and test (5.61%) losses. Finally, the hybrid model was integrated into a novel MPC system and experimentally validated, demonstrating robust real-time substrate feed control in a way that allows it to maintain specific target growth rates. The system achieved predictive accuracies of 6.51% for biomass and 14.65% for product estimation, with an average tracking error of 10.64%. In summary, this work establishes a robust, adaptable, and efficient hybrid modeling framework for MPC in P. pastoris bioprocesses. By integrating automated architecture searching, transfer learning, and MPC, the approach offers a practical and generalizable solution for real-time control and supports scalable digital twin deployment in industrial biotechnology.

TI  - A multiscale hybrid modelling methodology for cell cultures enabled by enzyme-constrained dynamic metabolic flux analysis under uncertainty
T2  - METABOLIC ENGINEERING
AB  - Mammalian cell cultures make a significant contribution to the pharmaceutical industry. They produce many of the biopharmaceuticals obtaining FDA-approval each year. Motivated by quality-by-design principles, various modelling methodologies are frequently trialled to gain insight into these bioprocesses. However, these systems are highly complex and uncertain, involving dynamics at different scales, both in time and space, making them challenging to model in a comprehensive and fully mechanistic manner. This study develops a machine-learningsupported multiscale modelling framework of cell cultures, linking the macroscale bioprocess dynamics to the microscale metabolic flux distribution. As a relevant biopharmaceutical case study, we consider the production of Trastuzumab by Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells in batch. A macroscale hybrid model is constructed by integrating macro-kinetic and machine-learning approaches. Enzyme-constrained Dynamic Metabolic Flux Analysis (ecDMFA) is adopted to calculate flux distributions based on the dynamic predictions of the hybrid model. Uncertainty estimation of the multiscale model is conducted through bootstrapping. Judging from experimental data, our hybrid model can reduce the modelling error of the macroscale dynamics to 8.0%; a 70% reduction from the purely mechanistic model. In addition, the predicted dynamic flux distribution aligns with observations seen in literature, highlighting important metabolic changes throughout the process. Model uncertainty is maintained at a low level, demonstrating the trustworthiness of the predictions. Overall, our comprehensive modelling framework has the potential to facilitate the development of digital twins in the biopharmaceutical industry.

TI  - Reachability analysis of FMI models using data-driven dynamic sensitivity
T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Digital twin is a technology that facilitates a real-time coupling of a cyber-physical system and its virtual representation. The technology is applicable to a variety of domains and facilitates more intelligent and dependable system design and operation, but it relies heavily on the existence of digital models that can be depended upon. In realistic systems, there is no single monolithic digital model of the system. Instead, the system is broken into subsystems, with models exported from different tools corresponding to each subsystem. In this paper, we focus on techniques that can be used for a black-box model, such as the ones implementing the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard, formal analysis, and verification. We propose two techniques for simulation-based reachability analysis of models. The first one is based on system dynamics, while the second one utilizes dynamic sensitivity analysis to improve the quality of the results. Our techniques employ simulations to obtain the model's sensitivity with respect to the initial state (or model's Lipschitz constant) which is then used to compute reachable states of the system. The approaches also provide probabilistic guarantees on the accuracy of the computed reachable sets that are based on simulations. Each technique requires different levels of information about the black-box system, allowing the readers to select the best technique according to the capabilities of the models. The validation experiments have demonstrated that our proposed algorithms compute accurate reachable sets of stable and unstable linear systems. The approach based on dynamic sensitivity provides an accurate and, with respect to system dimensions, more scalable approach, while the sampling-based method allows a flexible trade-off between accuracy and runtime cost. The validation results also show that our approaches are promising even when applied to nonlinear systems, especially, when applied to larger and more complex systems. The reproducibility package with code and data can be found at https://github.com/twright/FMI-Reachability-Reproducibility.

TI  - Enabling Total Process Digital Twin in Sugar Refining through the Integration of Secondary Crystallization Influences
T2  - PROCESSES
AB  - Crystallization is the main thermal process resulting in the formation of solid products and, therefore, is widely spread in all kinds of industries, from fine chemicals to foods and drugs. For these high-performance products, a quality by design (QbD) approach is applied to maintain high product purity and steady product parameters. In this QbD-context, especially demanded in the foods and drugs industry, the significance of models to deepen process understanding and moving toward automated operation is steadily rising. To reach these aspired goals, besides major process influences like crystallization temperature, other impacting parameters have to be evaluated and a model describing these influences is sought-after. In this work, the suitability of a population balance-based physico-chemical process model for the production of sugar is investigated. A model overview is given and the resulting model is compared to a statistical DoE scheme. The resulting process model is able to picture the effects of secondary process parameters, alongside temperature or temperature gradients, the influences of seed crystal size and amount, stirrer speed, and additives.

TI  - Determination of biological joint reaction forces from in-vivo experiments using a hybrid combination of biomechanical and mechanical engineering software
T2  - MECHANICS & INDUSTRY
AB  - In biomechanical field, several studies used OpenSim software to compute the joint reaction forces from kinematics and ground reaction forces measurements. The bio-inspired joints design and their manufacturing need the usage of mechanical modeling and simulation software tools. This paper proposes a new hybrid methodology to determine biological joint reaction forces from in vivo measurements using both biomechanical and mechanical engineering softwares. The methodology has been applied to the horse forelimb joints. The computed joint reaction forces results would be compared to the results obtained with OpenSim in a previous study. This new hybrid model used a combination of measurements (bone geometry, kinematics, ground reaction forces horizontal ellipsis ) and also OpenSim results (muscular and ligament forces). The comparison between the two models showed values with an average difference of 8% at trotting and 16% at jumping. These differences can be associated with the differences between the modelling strategies. Despite these differences, the mechanical modeling method allows the computation of advanced simulations to handle contact conditions in joints. In future, the proposed mechanical engineering methodology could open the door to define a biological digital twin of a quadruped limb including the real geometry modelling of the joint.

TI  - Application of simulation and machine learning in supply chain management: A synthesis of the literature using the Sim-ML literature classification framework
T2  - COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Stochastic modeling techniques, such as discrete-event and agent-based simulation, are widely used in supply chain management (SCM) for capturing real-world uncertainties. Over the last decade, data-driven approaches like machine learning (ML) have also gained prominence in SCM, employing methods such as supervised learning (SL), unsupervised learning (UL), and reinforcement learning (RL). As supply chains grow in complexity, hybrid models combining simulation (Sim) and ML are becoming increasingly common, and the field stands to gain from a structured review of this literature. Towards this, we developed the Sim-ML Literature Classification Framework, which includes a hierarchical taxonomy comprising five SC criteria, 22 Sim-ML classes and over 75 Sim-ML subclasses. We applied this framework to synthesize 99 papers, revealing significant diversity in how Sim-ML models are used to address supply chain challenges. Key findings include the recognition of the breadth of study objectives, identifying various forms of model hybridization achieved by combining discrete/continuous simulation techniques with SL, UL, and RL approaches, and the data flow mechanisms such as sequential and feedback methods employed by the simulation and ML elements of the hybrid model. Our findings also identify some gaps in the literature; for example, optimization is rarely incorporated into Sim-ML models. Also, most studies present Sim-ML models for addressing problems in general supply chains, likely due to the lack of access to industrial data. The review also highlights that Industry 4.0 technologies, such as digital twins and blockchain, are underrepresented in current research, as are topics like sustainability and transportation. These gaps suggest significant opportunities for future research. We provide guidelines for practitioners on applying Sim-ML models to manage supply chain drivers, mitigate the impact of disruptions, and integrate emerging technologies. Our review serves as a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and students interested in leveraging Sim-ML approaches in SCM.

It describes cyber physical systems risk assessment (CPSRA), a tool to provide automatic decision support for enhancing the overall resilience of CPS architectures often used in critical infrastructures. CPRSA is built to enhance industrial risk assessment and improve the resilience of CPS architecture against malicious attacks on the cyber domain that can affect industrial processes, which is critical in a distributed cyber environment. Such attacks often compromise execution states on physical components and lead to hazards or even disasters through plant malfunction. CPSRA is tested against a real-world testbed model of a large SCADA system that is infused with real-world CVE vulnerabilities in some of its components. The tool creates an isomorphic graph of the CPS process model and uses graph algorithms and network analytics on the model to test cyber-attacks and evaluate attack resilience aspects. The tool's output is then used to pinpoint high-complexity components in terms of influence on the overall CPS architecture and suggest mitigation points for security measure implementation while considering every potential subattack path and subliminal path on the model's attack graph. The paper complements standardized assessment reports and contributes to automatic architecture assessment for critical infrastructure environments and can be used as the basis to model dependencies and threat propagation in larger digital twins, a need outlined in major NIST publications concerning the security of industrial systems that was previously done manually, without automatic insight into state and vulnerability influences.

TI  - Simulation Testing of Maritime Cyber-Physical Systems: Application of Model-View-ViewModel
T2  - COMPLEXITY
AB  - From the perspective of the system of systems development, system-level functional testing is required for designing subsystems. This study utilizes modeling and simulation techniques to analyze the operational behaviors of the subsystems and confirm data communication between them. The targeted system in the study is a naval combat system (NCS), which is a typical type of defense cyber-physical system (CPS). Three types of models were designed for the simulation testing of the NCS: a combat-management model for simulating the overall computational activities, physical models to confirm the intrasubsystem behaviors, and data integration models to test the intersubsystem communications. These models are realized with the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern, which strongly facilitates graphical user interfaces being decoupled from model logic and data. We consider underwater combat scenarios as an application. Six significant physical subsystems within the NCS are simulated and tested: a ship-steering system, an inertial navigation system, a global navigation satellite system, a periscope, sonar systems, and a plotting board. We expect that the proposed work will play a principal role when analyzing the behaviors and communications of defense CPSs and providing an environment for functional testing as a digital twin.

TI  - Tsunami debris motion and loads in a scaled port setting: Comparative analysis of three state-of-the-art numerical methods against experiments
T2  - COASTAL ENGINEERING
AB  - We present an international comparative analysis of simulated 3D tsunami debris hazards, applying three state-of-the-art numerical methods: the Material Point Method (MPM, ClaymoreUW, multi-GPU), Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH, DualSPHysics, GPU), and Eulerian grid-based computational fluid dynamics (Simcenter STAR-CCM+, multi-CPU/GPU). Three teams, two from the United States and one from Germany, apply their unique expertise to shed light on the state of advanced tsunami debris modeling in both open source and professional software. A mutually accepted and meaningful benchmark is set as 1:40 Froude scale model experiments of shipping containers mobilized into and amidst a port setting with simplified and generic structures, closely related to the seminal Tohoku 2011 tsunami case histories which majorly affected seaports. A sophisticated wave flume at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan, hosted the experiments as reported by Goseberget al. (2016b). Across dozens of trials, an elongated vacuum-chamber wave surges and spills over a generic harbor apron, mobilizing 3-6 hollow debris-modeling sea containers-, in 1-2 vertical layers against friction. One to two rows of 5 square obstacles are placed upstream or downstream of the debris, with widths and gaps of 0.66x and 2.2x of debris length, respectively. The work reports and compares results on the long wave generation from a vacuum-controlled tsunami wave maker, longitudinal displacement of debris forward and back, lateral spreading angle of debris, interactions of stacked debris, and impact forces measured with debris accelerometers and/or obstacle load-cells. Each team writes a foreword on their digital twin model, which are all open-sourced. Then, preliminary statistical analysis contrasts simulations originating off different numerical methods, and simulations with experiments. Afterward, team's give value propositions for their numerical tool. Finally, a transparent cross-interrogation of results highlights the strengths of each respective method.

TI  - Hybrid modelling for remote process monitoring and optimisation
T2  - DIGITAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Process simulation is used to develop a digital twin representation of chemical processes typically for process op-timization or what-if scenarios. However, it is known to be computationally expensive and there is an increasing need for process remote monitoring and optimization. This is where machine learning models shine, where they can run up to several orders of magnitude faster than their equivalent first principle process simulation models. Most of the previous work in this area tend to demonstrate the ability of machine learning models to accurately capture complex, non-linear relationships between process parameters in various chemical processes. Two impor-tant aspects are rarely discussed, namely the construction of machine learning models using operating data and the deployment of these models. In this paper, we address these two aspects and review the different informa-tion silos in industrial settings that need to be considered when working with hybrid models (combining process simulation and machine learning). This is illustrated by a case study for an operating natural gas dehydration unit, covering data management, process simulation, machine learning and visualization. We demonstrate how the hybrid models can be constructed and packaged as an online monitoring and a prediction dashboard. Several unique challenges are also highlighted including the reliability of field data and operational deviations due to operability and controllability -all of which need to be understood in order to successfully translate operating systems to process simulation and machine learning models that are reliable and accurate. While the exact imple-mentation may vary from project to project, the current work serves as an example and highlights the important considerations to make when working with such systems.

TI  - Development of 2D Steady-State Mathematical Model for Blast Furnace Using OpenFOAM®
T2  - METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS B-PROCESS METALLURGY AND MATERIALS PROCESSING SCIENCE
AB  - Blast furnaces remained the primary producer of hot metal iron despite the competition posed by alternating iron-making processes for the last 50 years. Possibly, when the hydrogen economy becomes a reality, its importance may fade sometime in the distant future. Mathematical modeling and simulation played a crucial role in gaining insights and thereby helped to optimize the process. Authors opine that commercial CFD packages do not offer enough flexibility to incorporate additional physics needed to develop simulation tools for complex processes like a blast furnace. Also, such solutions are not amenable to online deployment for use in operations. Thus, most of the models presented in the literature were developed from scratch by various researchers. However, these codes are neither efficient in computation, suitable for a parallel run nor better in robustness. In this context, to take advantage of new computational paradigms in terms of flexibility offered through open-source codes, in conjunction with parallelization, a comprehensive 2D blast furnace model has been developed using OpenFOAM (R). In essence, it has opened a new pathway towards achieving an online digital twin for a complex process such as a blast furnace. The researchers have used standard heat, mass, and momentum balance equations. However, equations do differ when it comes to reaction kinetics, melting phenomena, etc. In the present study, the melting model uses the beginning of softening and the end of melting temperatures to calculate the liquid fraction formed, which is linearly changing with temperature. This has resulted in improved convergence. The model equations and their implementation in OpenFOAM (R) are presented in detail. As opposed to the prior art of the blast furnace simulation models, the present study demonstrates the grid independence, as well as the convergence of the fusion zone. The model predicts the size and shape of the cohesive zone and is shown to be capable of simulating various scenarios involving different burden distributions and other operating parameters through a parametric study.

TI  - Working mode in aircraft manufacturing based on digital coordination model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB  - As a key and core technology in aircraft manufacturing industry, assembly coordination technology is important to improve the competitiveness and manufacturing level. To get accurate dimensional size/shape/spatial position and coordination accuracy, according to characteristics of the working mode based on hard master tooling, working mode based on digital coordination model (DCM) is developed. Firstly, with the idea of digital twin, by analyzing the controlling method for coordination accuracy. a principle of the working mode based on DCM is proposed. The defined DCM is a process model that mirrors a practical assembly site, which consists of coordination element (CE), coordination relationship (CR), and control method for coordination accuracy (CMCA). It can replace hard master tooling as the only basis for the transfer process of dimension/shape/position in aircraft manufacturing. Secondly, the principle and detailed function process based on DCM in the whole aircraft manufacturing stage are presented. It is shown that the foundation of this mode is DCM, the focus of this mode is error transfer process in assembly, the direct analysis basis of this mode is measuring data, the core factor of this mode is dynamic feedback adjustment, and the ultimate goal is to control the consistency of accumulated error between assemblies. In contrast with the working mode based on hard master tooling, under the measuring field and virtual simulation/analysis environment, the function process of this mode is a dynamic closed loop comprising CEs/CRs that can be adjusted continually in real time with CMCA. Lastly, flexible assembling of four wing flap components is verified. Benefit results showed that the propagation of dimension/shape/position for products and flexible tooling can be completed under the working mode based on DCM. Furthermore, assembly accuracy and coordination accuracy can fit design requirements well, and the assembly efficiency with this new working mode is increased about 40%.

TI  - Integration of SysML and Virtual Reality Environment: A Ground Based Telescope System Example
T2  - SYSTEMS
AB  - In recent years, Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has continued to develop as a standard for designing, managing, and maintaining increasingly complex systems. Unlike the document centric approach, MBSE puts the model at the heart of system design. Among the various MBSE language development efforts, "Systems Modeling Language (SysML)", is the most anticipated and broadly utilized in the research and in industrial practice. SysML originated from Unified Modeling Language (UML) and follows the Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM). SysML diagrams help users create various systems engineering artifacts, including requirements, use cases, operational concepts, system architecture, system behaviors, and parametric analyses of a system model. In the early days of implementation, MBSE languages, including SysML, typically relied on static viewpoints and limited simulation support to depict and analyze a system model. Due the continuous improvement efforts and new implementation approaches by researchers and organizations, SysML has advanced vastly to encompass dynamic viewpoints, in-situ simulation and enable integration with external modeling and simulation (M&S) tools. Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a user interactive and immersive visualization technology and can depict reality in a virtual environment at different levels of fidelity. VR can play a crucial role in developing dynamic and interactive viewpoints to improve the MBSE approach. In this research paper, the authors developed and implemented a methodology for integrating SysML and VR, enabling tools to achieve three dimensional viewpoints, an immersive user experience and early design evaluations of the system of interest (SOI). The key components of the methodology being followed in this research paper are the SysML, a VR environment, extracted data and scripting languages. The authors initially developed a SysML for a ground-based telescope system following the four pillars of SysML: Structure, Requirements, Behavior and Parametrics. The SysML diagram components are exported from the model using the velocity template language and then fed into a virtual reality game engine. Then, the SysML diagrams are visualized in the VR environment to enable better comprehension and interaction with users and Digital Twin (DT) technologies. In addition, a VR simulation scenario of space objects is generated based on the input from the SysML, and the simulation result is sent back from the VR tool into the model with the aid of parametric diagram simulation. Hence, by utilizing the developed SysML-VR integration methodology, VR environment scenarios are successfully integrated with the SysML. Finally, the research paper mentions a few limitations of the current implementation and proposes future improvements.

TI  - Predicting electrical power consumption of end milling using a virtual machining energy toolkit (V_MET)
T2  - COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY
AB  - Understanding electrical energy consumption of machines and processes is of increasing importance to (i) minimise costs and environmental impact of production activities and (ii) provide an additional information stream to inform condition monitoring systems (i.e. digital twins) about a machine's status and health. The research outlined in this paper develops a Virtual Machining Energy Toolkit (V_MET) to predict the electrical power consumption of a Computer Numeric Control (CNC) milling machine cutting a particular part program from preparatory codes (i.e. G code). In this way the evaluation of the energy impact of manufacturing part programs prior to implementation and real-time monitoring of the process can become a routine activity at part of a total manufacturing system optimisation. The novelty of this work lies in the inclusion of a virtual CNC process model to determine cutting geometry (i.e. width and depth of cut) to enable the prediction of relatively complex part program geometry.V_MET consists of three components: (i) the NC interpreter to extract key parameters (e.g. spindle speed, feed rate, tool path) from G-code instructions, (ii) a virtual CNC process model to determine instantaneous cutting geometry (i.e. width and depth of cut) and the material removal from the resulting machining by simulating the motion of the tool path to predict the interaction between the tool tip and workpiece and (iii) an energy model to predict the electrical power consumption for a given set of conditions, developed using regression analysis of data collected under real manufacturing conditions.Validation of V_MET has been conducted by physical machining of different product features to evaluate the validity over a range of different cutting parameters, NC operations (i.e. linear, clockwise interpolations) and repasses over previously cut regions. Overall good accuracy has been observed for the predicted energy requirements as a function of the cutting regimes, with 4.3% error in total energy and Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) of 5.6% when compared with measurements taken during physical cutting trials.

TI  - Quantum-Based Creative Generation Method for a Dancing Robot
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROROBOTICS
AB  - In this paper, we propose a creative generation process model based on the quantum modeling simulation method. This model is mainly aimed at generating the running trajectory of a dancing robot and the execution plan of the dancing action. First, we used digital twin technology to establish data mapping between the robot and the computer simulation environment to realize intelligent controllability of the robot's trajectory and the dance movements described in this paper. Second, we conducted many experiments and carried out a lot of research into information retrieval, information fidelity, and result evaluation. We constructed a multilevel three-dimensional spatial quantum knowledge map (M-3DQKG) based on the coherence and entangled states of quantum modeling and simulation. Combined with dance videos, we used regions with convolutional neural networks (R-CNNs) to extract character bones and movement features to form a movement library. We used M-3DQKG to quickly retrieve information from the knowledge base, action library, and database, and then the system generated action models through a holistically nested edge detection (HED) network. The system then rendered scenes that matched the actions through generative adversarial networks (GANs). Finally, the scene and dance movements were integrated, and the creative generation process was completed. This paper also proposes the creativity generation coefficient as a means of evaluating the results of the creative process, combined with artificial brain electroenchalographic data to assist in evaluating the degree of agreement between creativity and needs. This paper aims to realize the automation and intelligence of the creative generation process and improve the creative generation effect and usability of dance movements. Experiments show that this paper has significantly improved the efficiency of knowledge retrieval and the accuracy of knowledge acquisition, and can generate unique and practical dance moves. The robot's trajectory is novel and changeable, and can meet the needs of dance performances in different scenes. The creative generation process of dancing robots combined with deep learning and quantum technology is a required field for future development, and could provide a considerable boost to the progress of human society.

TI  - Artificial Neural Network for Fast and Versatile Model Parameter Adjustment Utilizing PAT Signals of Chromatography Processes for Process Control under Production Conditions
T2  - PROCESSES
AB  - Preparative chromatography is a well-established operation in chemical and biotechnology manufacturing. Chromatography achieves high separation performances, but often has to deal with the yield versus purity trade-off as the optimization criterium regarding through-put. The initial trade-off is often disturbed by the well-known phenomenon of chromatogram shifts over process lifetime, and has to be corrected by operators via adjustment of peak fraction cutting. Nevertheless, with regard to autonomous operation and batch to continuous processing modes, an advanced process control strategy is needed to identify and correct shifts from the optimal operation point automatically. Previous studies have already presented solutions for batch-to-batch variance and process control options with the aid of rigorous physico-chemical process modeling. These models can be implemented as distinct digital twins as well as statistical process operation data analyzers. In order to utilize such models for advanced process control (APC), the model parameters have to be updated with the aid of inline Process Analytical Technology (PAT) data to describe the actual operational status. This updating process also includes any operational change phenomena that occur, and its relation to their physico-chemical root cause. Typical phenomena are fluid dynamic changes due to packing breakage, channelling or compression as well as mass transfer and phase equilibrium-related separation performance decrease due to adsorbent aging or feed and buffer composition changes. In order to track these changes, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained in this work. The ANN training is in this first step, based on the simulation results of a distinct and previously experimentally validated process model. The model is implemented in the open source tool CasADi for Python. This allows the implementation of interfaces to process control systems, among others, with relatively low effort. Therefore, PAT signals can easily be incorporated for sufficient adjustment of the process model for appropriate process control. Further steps would be the implementation of optimization routines based on PAT and ANN predictions to derive optimal operation points with the model.

TI  - Process engineering of semi-continuous boiling of massecuites based on Digital Twin of sucrose crystallization
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING
AB  - The purpose of the study is to simulate the process of isobaric evaporative crystallization of sucrose to substantiate new ways of its industrial implementation. Using computer simulation, a three-stage crystallization technology for semi-continuous boiling of massecuites on a prepared crystalline base of a seed suspension (first stage) and a crystalline base of the preceding massecuite (second and third stages) was designed. A computer computational model of the express method for determining the molasses saturation coefficient has been created. By heating to a temperature of 50-55 degrees C, the molasses is transferred to an unsaturated state, then oscillating white sugar crystals are partially dissolved until saturation is reached while under conductometric control. The method makes it possible to determine the optimal parameters of standard molasses, taking into account the technical characteristics of crystallization equipment and centrifuges. On the basis of simulation modeling in the VisSim software environment, tests were carried out, and a justification was given for the technology of semi-continuous boiling of massecuite massecuites to increase the efficiency of crystallization in batch vacuum pans.

TI  - Enhancing Facility Management with Emerging Technologies: A Study on the Application of Blockchain and NFTs
T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - In recent years, Facility Management has undergone significant technological and methodological advancements, primarily driven by Building Information Modelling (BIM), Computer-Aided Facility Management (CAFM), and Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS). These innovations have improved process efficiency and risk management. However, challenges remain in asset management, maintenance, traceability, and transparency. This study investigates the potential of blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to address these challenges. By referencing international (ISO, BOMA) and European (EN) standards, the research develops an asset management process model incorporating blockchain and NFTs. The methodology includes evaluating the technical and practical aspects of this model and strategies for metadata utilization. The model ensures an immutable record of transactions and maintenance activities, reducing errors and fraud. Smart contracts automate sub-phases like progress validation and milestone-based payments, increasing operational efficiency. The study's practical implications are significant, offering advanced solutions for transparent, efficient, and secure Facility Management. It lays the groundwork for future research, emphasizing practical implementations and real-world case studies. Additionally, integrating blockchain with emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning could further enhance Facility Management processes.

TI  - Computational graph completion
T2  - RESEARCH IN THE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES
AB  - We introduce a framework for generating, organizing, and reasoning with computational knowledge. It is motivated by the observation that most problems in Computational Sciences and Engineering (CSE) can be described as that of completing (from data) a computational graph (or hypergraph) representing dependencies between functions and variables. In that setting nodes represent variables and edges (or hyperedges) represent functions (or functionals). Functions and variables may be known, unknown, or random. Data come in the form of observations of distinct values of a finite number of subsets of the variables of the graph (satisfying its functional dependencies). The underlying problem combines a regression problem (approximating unknown functions) with a matrix completion problem (recovering unobserved variables in the data). Replacing unknown functions by Gaussian processes and conditioning on observed data provides a simple but efficient approach to completing such graphs. Since the proposed framework is highly expressive, it has a vast potential application scope. Since the completion process can be automatized, as one solves root root 2 + root 3 on a pocket calculator without thinking about it, one could, with the proposed framework, solve a complex CSE problem by drawing a diagram. Compared to traditional regression/kriging, the proposed framework can be used to recover unknown functions with much scarcer data by exploiting interdependencies between multiple functions and variables. The computational graph completion (CGC) problem addressed by the proposed framework could therefore also be interpreted as a generalization of that of solving linear systems of equations to that of approximating unknown variables and functions with noisy, incomplete, and nonlinear dependencies. Numerous examples illustrate the flexibility, scope, efficacy, and robustness of the CGC framework and show how it can be used as a pathway to identifying simple solutions to classical CSE problems. These examples include the seamless CGC representation of known methods (for solving/learning PDEs, surrogate/multiscale modeling, mode decomposition, deep learning) and the discovery of new ones (digital twin modeling, dimension reduction).

TI  - Credibility assessment of patient-specific computational modeling using patient-specific cardiac modeling as an exemplar
T2  - PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
AB  - Reliable and robust simulation of individual patients using patient-specific models (PSMs) is one of the next frontiers for modeling and simulation (M&S) in healthcare. PSMs, which form the basis of digital twins, can be employed as clinical tools to, for example, assess disease state, predict response to therapy, or optimize therapy. They may also be used to construct virtual cohorts of patients, for in silico evaluation of medical product safety and/or performance. Methods and frameworks have recently been proposed for evaluating the credibility of M&S in healthcare applications. However, such efforts have generally been motivated by models of medical devices or generic patient models; how best to evaluate the credibility of PSMs has largely been unexplored. The aim of this paper is to understand and demonstrate the credibility assessment process for PSMs using patient-specific cardiac electrophysiological (EP) modeling as an exemplar. We first review approaches used to generate cardiac PSMs and consider how verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) apply to cardiac PSMs. Next, we execute two simulation studies using a publicly available virtual cohort of 24 patient-specific ventricular models, the first a multi-patient verification study, the second investigating the impact of uncertainty in personalized and non-personalized inputs in a virtual cohort. We then use the findings from our analyses to identify how important characteristics of PSMs can be considered when assessing credibility with the approach of the ASME V&V40 Standard, accounting for PSM concepts such as inter- and intra-user variability, multi-patient and "every-patient" error estimation, uncertainty quantification in personalized vs non-personalized inputs, clinical validation, and others. The results of this paper will be useful to developers of cardiac and other medical image based PSMs, when assessing PSM credibility.
   Author summary
   Patient-specific models are computational models that have been personalized using data from a patient. After decades of research, recent computational, data science and healthcare advances have opened the door to the fulfilment of the enormous potential of such models, from truly personalized medicine to efficient and cost-effective testing of new medical products. However, reliability (credibility) of patient-specific models is key to their success, and there are currently no general guidelines for evaluating credibility of patient-specific models. Here, we consider how frameworks and model evaluation activities that have been developed for generic (not patient-specific) computational models, can be extended to patient specific models. We achieve this through a detailed analysis of the activities required to evaluate cardiac electrophysiological models, chosen as an exemplar field due to its maturity and the complexity of such models. This is the first paper on the topic of reliability of patient-specific models and will help pave the way to reliable and trusted patient-specific modeling across healthcare applications.

TI  - An Integrative User-Level Customized Modeling and Simulation Environment for Smart Manufacturing
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - As smart factories are emerging, the importance of modeling and simulation (M & x0026;S) continues to increase in the production system. As a result, various commercial tools and environments are provided for production simulation, and manufacturing companies are also applying them to establish a smart manufacturing system. This is used in various ways, such as optimal layout design, scheduling, and fault diagnosis using the acquired smart manufacturing model. However, these model constructions are generally done through a stand-alone environment in which the work type or user level is not considered. It is necessary to use different environments depending on the user level or to rely on M & x0026;S experts. Therefore, this paper eliminates this inefficiency and proposes an integrative user-level customized smart manufacturing M & x0026;S environment for all users in the production system. It provides three-phase modeling environments appropriate for the user level, including an automatic model synthesis interface and a production line generator. Using this environment, anyone can easily make capacity and logistic models, and simulate them.

TI  - An Automated Verification Framework for DEVS-Coupled Models to Enhance Efficient Modeling and Simulation
T2  - PROCESSES
AB  - Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) is a formalism widely used for modeling and simulating complex systems. The main features of DEVS are defining models in a strict mathematical form and representing systems through hierarchical structures. However, when DEVS models have incorrect connection structures and inappropriate behaviors contrary to design intentions, simulation results can be distorted. This can cause serious problems that may lead to inaccurate decision-making. In this paper, we propose an automated verification framework to improve the accuracy and efficiency of coupled models in the DEVS-Python environment. This framework defines test scripts for coupled models, performs automatic verification before simulation execution, and provides the results to users. Experimental results showed that the proposed framework improved execution time by approximately 30-100 times compared to traditional unit testing methods, although memory and CPU usage increased slightly. Despite this increase in resource usage, the proposed framework provides high efficiency and consistent performance in verifying complex DEVS-coupled models.

TI  - Development of FEA-ANN-Integrated Approach for Process Optimization of Coaxial One-Side Resistance Spot Welding of Al5052 and CFRP
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB  - Coaxial one-side resistance spot welding (COS-RSW) is a newly developed process for joining metals and composites. In the present study, Al5052 and carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) lap joints were fabricated via COS-RSW. The welding process was modeled numerically using an in-house finite element code called JWRIAN. Single-lap shear tests were performed to evaluate the joining strength. The molten zone diameter was defined and measured experimentally to verify the numerical model. An artificial neural network (ANN) was established based on multitask learning, and its training data set was prepared via finite element analysis (FEA). The well-trained ANN was employed to generate a process window for the COS-RSW. Results demonstrated that the FEA could accurately reproduce the COS-RSW process, which served as an efficient tool for generating a process data set without performing experiments. The ANN performed multitask learning well and predicted the welding output effectively. Furthermore, T-mavg, an index representing the average value of the maximum temperature in the molten interface of CFRP, was adopted to evaluate the contribution of the integral interface temperature field to the bonding strength qualitatively. An optimal T-mavg value, which was close to the CFRP decomposition temperature of 340 degrees C, was obtained, and it exhibited an excellent correlation with higher bonding strengths. The process window provided welding parameters directly to yield the desired results.

TI  - Using modeling and simulation and artificial intelligence to improve complex adaptive systems engineering
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODELING SIMULATION AND SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING
AB  - Systems engineering practices are evolving to address fast-changing needs in fielding complex systems. These needs create an environment in which system needs evolve or change too quickly to be tracked or managed by humans' natural capabilities. We propose that systems engineering must aid systems engineering managers by providing architectural alternatives and design options. Further, as systems become more complex and dynamic, there is an increased need to identify hidden risks, model emergent behavior, and expose hidden patterns in the behavior of stakeholders. Systems engineering needs to evolve to build fast-fielded, resilient, and adaptive systems that leverage positive reinforcement feedback loops with multiple experimental and real-world information sources. The very basis of systems engineering must evolve from today's development paradigms to a future that leverages modeling, simulation, and artificial intelligence to drastically improve the capability and agility for developing new systems. This paper proposes a common way forward to enable this new form of complex adaptive systems engineering.

TI  - Uncertainty quantification in inerter-based quasiperiodic lattices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Inerter-based periodic structures have attracted significant interest among the research community due to their wide range of applications. However, existing studies on quasiperiodic structures, especially with inerters, are limited. Therefore, this timely work investigates the dynamics of novel one-dimensional inerter-based quasiperiodic lattices with and without local resonators. The quasiperiodicity is introduced through the modulation of both spring and inerter properties resulting in the well-known Hofstadter-like butterfly spectrum having a fractal structure. Moreover, by considering the appropriate boundary conditions and many mass- spring-inerter subsystems, the bulk spectrum of the system is investigated demonstrating the existence of multiple edge states in lower and higher frequency ranges. The deterministic study showed that the effect of inertia amplification is to reduce the frequencies of the Hofstadter-like butterfly and to widen the low frequency band gaps. The second contribution of this work involves investigating the effect of parametric uncertainty for the acoustic-metamaterial-like chain based on Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, to address the computational aspect of the problem, grey-box modeling using machine learning was performed. A Gaussian process model was trained on a limited dataset and was found to capture the stochastic responses of the lattices adequately. The statistical variation of parameters with different levels of uncertainty demonstrated significant effects on the Hofstadter-like butterfly, band gaps, corresponding edge states and frequency responses. The sensitivity of the dynamic behavior in quasiperiodic lattices to variabilities reveal the need to account for system uncertainties for their targeted performance as future vibration absorbers and energy harvesters. The study also paves the way to utilize the results as useful prior information for robust design optimization of real inerter-based quasiperiodic lattice devices.

TI  - A Discrete Event Simulation of Patient Flow in an Assisted Reproduction Clinic With the Integration of a Smart Health Monitoring System
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - In spite of continuous medical and technological advances, there are still treatments today, e.g., infertility treatments, that have not been addressed using remote monitoring due to the absence of reliable devices and smart health monitoring systems (SHMSs). A recent European Union report highlights the need for scientific investment in remote monitoring efficiency. To expedite cost-effective real-data experiments, the scientific community emphasizes complementing SHMSs with modeling and simulation techniques, allowing the projection of comprehensive treatment scenarios and informed decision-making based on synthetic data. In this paper, we conducted simulations of patient flow in two assisted reproduction clinics, with real data, applying discrete event simulation techniques. Four simulation scenarios were run for the Alicante clinic: (i) current system organization, (ii) using SHMS with the same resources, (iii) SHMS with reduced clinical staff, and (iv) SHMS with modified staff allocation. In a large-scale clinic in Madrid, two scenarios were simulated: (i) current system organization and (ii) SHMS with the same resources. The simulation of different scenarios enabled (i) the identification of a bottleneck in an ultrasound scanning area in the current system's organization; (ii) modelling of the relocation of the clinical staff within the clinic; and (iii) a proposal of the most optimal scenario with SHMS. Comparing the obtained results, we showed a reduction in the workload of the receptionists, in the ultrasound and blood collection areas and finally reduced the workload of physicians with first half and the second half of the working day schedules in both clinics.

TI  - Automated generation of simulation model in context of industry 4.0
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODELLING AND SIMULATION
AB  - Material flow simulation is a core technology of Industry 4.0. It can analyze and improve large-scale production systems through experimentation with digital simulation models. However, modeling in discrete event simulation is considered as an effortful and time-consuming activity and challenges especially small and medium-sized enterprises. Systematic experiments and what-if-analysis require a large number of models. Modeling and simulation becomes a repetitive activity and the ability to model and simulate instantly becomes crucial for industry, 4.0. However, model generation typically uses specific methods to build models with individual properties for specific physical systems. A general literature review cannot sufficiently describe the current state of model generation. This study aims to provide an analysis of model generation based on the modeling strategy, modeling view, and production system type, as well as model properties and limitations.

TI  - GO-DEVS: Storage and Retrieval System for DEVS Models Using Graph and Ontology Representation
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - DEVS is a powerful formal language to describe discrete event systems in modeling and simulation areas and useful for component-based design. One of the advantages of component-based design is reusability. To reuse or share DEVS models developed by many other modelers, a system to systematically store and retrieve many DEVS models should be supported. However, to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist such a system. In this paper, we propose GO-DEVS (Graph/Ontology-represented DEVS storage and retrieval system) to store and retrieve DEVS models using graph and ontology representation. For effective model sharing, an ontology is introduced when a DEVS model is developed. To search for DEVS models in an effective and efficient way, we propose two types of queries, IO query and structure query, and provide a method to store and query DEVS models on an RDBMS. Finally, we experimentally show GO-DEVS can process the queries efficiently.

TI  - Validating the Virtual Calendering Process With 3D-Reconstructed Composite Electrode: An Optimization Framework for Electrode Design
T2  - SMALL
AB  - Calendering is an essential fabrication step for lithium-ion battery electrodes, aimed at achieving the target density through mechanical compression. During this process, the electrode's microstructure significantly deforms, affecting its electrochemical performance. Therefore, it is important to understand how the microstructure evolves during calendering and correlate these changes with electrochemical behavior. Despite tremendous experimental efforts, there are limitations in obtaining sufficient outcomes. In this regard, simulations offer valuable information; however, the highest priority is to develop a reliable modeling framework that reflects actual microstructural changes and establish a robust validating methodology. Without such a framework, computational predictions may not align with experimental results. This study develops a virtual calendering framework based on high-resolution FIB-SEM tomography images of a bimodal LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode with a mass loading of 19.8 mg cm-2 and 96 wt.% active material. The framework is rigorously validated through systematically designed experiments across various electrode densities (2.3-4.0 g cm-3) and further analysis of hidden microstructural features, such as ionic tortuosity, contact area, and crack structure through additional tomography analysis. The virtual calendering framework successfully predicts microstructural changes and electrochemical performance, offering a reliable pathway for identifying optimal design parameters in a time- and cost-effective manner.

TI  - Surrogate model-based calibration of a flying Earth observation satellite
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
AB  - At the European Space Agency (ESA), Modeling and Simulation (M&S) plays a fundamental role during the lifetime of a spacecraft, being used from the design phase to the testing and during operations in space. M&S tools embed general physics-based models and disciplines characterized by configurable parameters which have to be calibrated in order to mimic the behavior of the actual flying spacecraft. However, their calibration requires a large number of simulations which are unfeasible to be obtained through computationally expensive high-fidelity simulation models. Thus, the inability to calibrate the high-fidelity simulation models poses limitations for the use of M&S tools during spacecraft operations. In this light, the present work proposes the use of a surrogate model-based approach for the calibration of simulation models of spacecraft. The approach integrates a computationally inexpensive deep-learning-based surrogate model, which mimics the highfidelity simulation model without requiring the same computational burden, and a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, to identify the optimal values of the simulation model configurable parameters. This enhances the capabilities of M&S tools and allows their use in operations. The approach's effectiveness is shown by its application to real flying Earth observation satellite data and simulation models. (c) 2023 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - When tiny is big: design alive
T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
AB  - One of the biggest achievements of the past half century has been making ever tinier structures. This miniaturization is at the foundation of three pillars that comprise the Digital Age: (1) computation, (2) digitization, and (3) communication. First, it is discussed how developments along these three pillars have affected the field of engineered systems. Next, the impact of these developments on the life cycle of engineered systems is examined from the perspective of (1) Information Technology (IT), (2) Embedded Technology (ET), and (3) Operation Technology (OT). A key value driver of IT is in the improved design approaches that are enabled by (1) the abundance of compute power and (2) connecting design activity within an organization as well as across organizations. Similarly, ET has provided much value by enabling the use of computation as the most important feature value driver of modern products. In turn, the large number of these software features relies on advances in communication networks as a critical infrastructure. Furthermore, digitization with remote sensing has opened up a trove of new features such as those in the area of autonomy. Finally, OT has benefited much from computation and digitization with communication features enabling current developments such as over-the-air updates. Building on the examination, a "design alive" outlook is presented that brings together the stages of system design and operation by live connectivity to continuously adapt each system on an individual basis and keep them performing in an optimal sense.

TI  - A Virtual Prototyping Platform for Exploration of Vehicular Electronics
T2  - IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB  - A critical requirement for robust, optimized, and secure design of vehicular systems is the ability to do system-level exploration, i.e., comprehend the interactions involved among electronic control units (ECUs), sensors, and communication interfaces in realizing system-level use cases and the impact of various design choices on these interactions. This must be done early in the system design to enable the designer to make optimal design choices without requiring a cost-prohibitive design overhaul. In this article, we develop a virtual prototyping environment for the modeling and simulation of vehicular systems. Our solution, ViVE, is modular and configurable, allowing the user to conveniently introduce new system-level use cases. Unlike other related simulation environments, our platform emphasizes coordination and communication among various vehicular components and just the abstraction of the necessary computation of each ECU. We discuss the ability of ViVE to explore the interactions between a number of realistic use cases in the automotive domain. We demonstrate the utility of the platform, in particular, to create real-time in-vehicle communication optimizers for various optimization targets. We also show how to use such a prototyping environment to explore vehicular security compromises. Furthermore, we showcase the experimental integration and validation of the platform with a hardware setup in a real-time scenario.

TI  - Simulation-driven engineering for the management of harmful algal and cyanobacterial blooms
T2  - SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Harmful algal and cyanobacterial blooms (HABs), occurring in inland and maritime waters, pose threats to natural environments by producing toxins that affect human and animal health. In the past, HABs have been assessed mainly by the manual collection and subsequent analysis of water samples and occasionally by automatic instruments that acquire information from fixed locations. These procedures do not provide data with the desirable spatial and temporal resolution to anticipate the formation of HABs. Hence, new tools and technologies are needed to efficiently detect, characterize and respond to HABs that threaten water quality. It is essential nowadays when the world's water supply is under tremendous pressure because of climate change, overexploitation, and pollution. This paper introduces Discrete Event System Specification-BLOOM, a novel framework for real-time monitoring and management of HABs. Its purpose is to support high-performance hazard detection with model-based system engineering and cyber-physical systems infrastructure for dynamic environments.

TI  - Integrated Process Model Applications Linking Bioprocess Development to Quality by Design Milestones
T2  - BIOENGINEERING-BASEL
AB  - Maximizing the value of each available data point in bioprocess development is essential in order to reduce the time-to-market, lower the number of expensive wet-lab experiments, and maximize process understanding. Advanced in silico methods are increasingly being investigated to accomplish these goals. Within this contribution, we propose a novel integrated process model procedure to maximize the use of development data to optimize the Stage 1 process validation work flow. We generate an integrated process model based on available data and apply two innovative Monte Carlo simulation-based parameter sensitivity analysis linearization techniques to automate two quality by design activities: determining risk assessment severity rankings and establishing preliminary control strategies for critical process parameters. These procedures are assessed in a case study for proof of concept on a candidate monoclonal antibody bioprocess after process development, but prior to process characterization. The evaluation was successful in returning results that were used to support Stage I process validation milestones and demonstrated the potential to reduce the investigated parameters by up to 24% in process characterization, while simultaneously setting up a strategy for iterative updates of risk assessments and process controls throughout the process life-cycle to ensure a robust and efficient drug supply.

TI  - Three-dimensional physical modeling of the wet manufacturing process of solid-state battery electrodes
T2  - JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB  - Poor design of composite electrodes in Solid-State Batteries (SSBs) is one of the main reasons for their low performance. Although modeling techniques offer great potential in investigating multiple conditions for microstructure optimization, SSB manufacturing remains almost unaddressed in terms of computational studies. We present here a three-dimensional physics-based modeling workflow to investigate the impact of wet manufacturing process parameters on the properties of SSB tape casted composite electrodes based on LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 as the active material and Li6PSCl5 sulfide solid electrolyte. Our proposed workflow models the entire process of wet manufacturing of SSB electrodes, starting with the slurry consisting of active material, carbon additive, binder, solid electrolyte and solvent, and continues through its drying process, and the calen-dering of the resulting electrodes. Our focus is in particular on the impact of the calendering degree on the microstructure of the electrode. We characterize the resulting microstructures in terms of electronic and ionic conduction properties. We believe that this first-of-its-kind wet manufacturing process model for SSB cathodes is an important step towards the development of systematic modeling approaches that can provide practical optimization of the interfaces between materials in electrodes to improve SSB performance and durability.

TI  - Hybrid Modeling and Simulation of the Grinding and Classification Process Driven by Multi-Source Compensation
T2  - MINERALS
AB  - The grinding process is a key link in mineral processing production and a typical complex, controlled process. The steady-state model is limited by its model structure and thus difficult to applyied in a control system. A hybrid modeling method driven by multi-source compensation is proposed in this paper based on the mechanism model using key equipment in the grinding and classification process, addressing the uncertainties which affect the stability of the control systems. This method combines the relevant multi-source signals with uncertainties by using a priori knowledge, extracts the nonlinear feature vector in the signal through an unsupervised depth network, and constructs a compensation model based on dynamic radial basis function network to realize the integration of mechanism modeling and data-driven compensation modeling. The simulation results show that the model has a high degree of fit to the real physical system; the industrial validation was conducted at a gold concentrator, the grinding product quality was predicted and controlled with the model.

T2  - RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB  - Lithium demand is surging, necessitating efficient extraction methods. Geothermal brines offer a promising alternative feedstock, yet comprehensive systems-level analyses are lacking. We developed an industrial process model for a plant processing 2000 ton/h geothermal brine using chemical precipitation to produce lithium carbonate, coupled with techno-economic and life cycle assessments to evaluate process economics and environmental impacts. A novel recycling process for on-site reuse of precipitating agents is also proposed, increasing total investment cost by 23% while reducing CO2 emissions by nearly 50% without extending the payback period. Additionally, we investigated the impact of feedstock concentration and water costs on process economics. Our findings show that low-concentration lithium brines (less than 200 mg/L) are economically viable only at high lithium carbonate selling prices. This study highlights the potential of geothermal brines as a sustainable lithium source and the benefits of integrating recycling processes to mitigate environmental concerns.

TI  - In-process 4D reconstruction in robotic additive manufacturing
T2  - ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING
AB  - Robotic additive manufacturing using a cold spray deposition head attached to a robotic arm can deposit material in a solid state with deposition rates in kilogrammes per hour. Under such a high deposition rate, the complicated interplay between the robot's motion, gun standoff distance, spray angle, overlapping, and the interaction of supersonic powder particles with a growing structure could cause overabundance or deficiency of material build-up. Over time, the accumulation of these discrepancies can negatively affect the overall shape and size of the final manufactured object. In -process spatio-temporal 3D reconstruction, also known as 4D reconstruction, could allow for early detection of deviations from the design, thus providing the opportunity to rectify at an early stage, making the process more robust, efficient and productive. However, in -process model reconstruction is challenging due to the dynamic nature of the scene (e.g. sensor and object relative movements), the three-dimensional growth of a time -varying build object, the textureless nature of build surfaces, and its computational complexity. We propose a real-time, in -process 4D reconstruction framework for free -form additive manufacturing processes, such as cold spray that deals with a real-time dynamic and evolving scene built by incremental deposition of materials. In our approach, temporal point clouds from three cameras are acquired and segmented to extract the region of interest (build object). The subsequent multitemporal and multi -camera registration of the segmented 3D data is addressed by combining geometrically constrained Fiducial marker tracking and plane -based registration without drift accumulation. Finally, the registered point clouds are fused via voxel fusion of growing parts to reconstruct the 3D model of the object with smoothened surfaces. The proposed solution is deployed and verified in a robotic cold spray cell with different test scenarios and shape complexities.

TI  - Patterns in the Public Square: Reference Models for Regulatory Science
T2  - ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Science and engineering involve discovery, representation, explanation, and exploitation of recurrent patterns, observed as phenomena. Model-based representations describe not only natural phenomena and engineered products, but also the socio-technical systems of systems that carry out scientific study, product engineering, medical practice, public health, commerce, and regulation. The term "Regulatory Science" invites us to represent and understand innovation, regulation and their intended and actual consequences as observable system phenomena in their own right, using scientific and engineering principles, tools, and insights. This article summarizes three classes of model-based reference patterns central to representing, understanding, communicating, and enhancing systems of innovation, regulation, and improvement over life cycles. In order of increasing scale, these pattern classes are (1) the domain-independent pattern of model-based representation of system phenomena (the S*Metamodel) in the sciences and engineering disciplines, underlying all modeling and simulation; (2) domain-specific patterns representing families of natural systems and engineered products in their life cycle contexts; and (3) the large-scale Innovation Ecosystem Pattern, in which science, engineering, commerce, medicine, and regulation are performed, planned, and advanced-including sharing of managed models and data across ecosystems. All three are applied by the Model-Based Patterns Working Group of the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE).

TI  - Intelligent optimization of stiffener unit cell via variational autoencoder-based feature extraction
T2  - STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION
AB  - Grid-stiffened structures are widely used in industrial equipment, where the layout of stiffener unit cells is critical in the structural performance. However, owing to the lack of design techniques, existing stiffener unit cell designs are often achieved only by comparative selection among several common cell configurations. In this study, a deep learning-based intelligent optimization framework for the stiffener unit cell of grid-stiffened panels was proposed. First, a database containing nearly 10,000 stiffener unit cells was generated by traversal while considering the manufacturability. Feature extraction was then performed on the generated database using a variational autoencoder and mapped to a 16-dimensional continuous latent design space according to geometric features. Subsequently, in this latent space, a Gaussian process model was established, and the maximum expected improvement criterion was utilized to drive the model update and optimization search, thus realizing data-driven optimization for the stiffener unit cell of grid-stiffened panels. In three typical numerical examples, compared with the best of the traditional stiffener unit cells, the obtained optimal designs were improved by 25.61%, 25.88%, and 10.66%, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method as an alternative stiffener unit cell design method. Furthermore, this study also indicates the significant potential of geometric feature extraction and further structural layout optimization via deep learning.

TI  - A Digital Shadow for Modeling, Studying and Preventing Urban Crime
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Crime is one of the greatest threats to urban security worldwide. A significant portion of the global population lives in countries where criminal activity poses serious challenges to public safety. In cities, most crimes tend to occur within dense urban environments, where social, economic, and spatial factors contribute to higher vulnerability. This paper presents the development and validation of a digital shadow platform for macro-modeling and simulating urban crime. This digital shadow has been constructed using data-driven agent-based modeling and simulation techniques, which are suitable for capturing dynamic interactions among individuals and with their environment. Our approach transforms and integrates well-known criminological theories and the expert knowledge of law enforcement agencies (LEA), policy makers, and other stakeholders under a theoretical model, which is in turn combined with real crime, spatial (cartographic) and socio-economic data into an urban model characterizing the daily behavior of citizens. The digital shadow has also been instantiated for the city of M & aacute;laga, for which we had over 300,000 reports available. This instance has been calibrated with those complaints and other geographic and socio-economic information of the city. To the best of our knowledge, our digital shadow is the first for large urban areas that has been calibrated with a large dataset of real crime reports and with an accurate representation of the urban environment. The performance indicators of the model after being calibrated, in terms of the metrics widely used in predictive policing, suggest that our simulated crime generation matches the general pattern of crime in the city according to historical data. Our digital shadow platform could be an interesting tool for modeling and predicting criminal behavior in an urban environment on a daily basis and, thus, a useful tool for policy makers, criminologists, sociologists, LEAs, etc. to study and prevent urban crime.

TI  - Process operations: from models and data to digital applications
T2  - COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Digital Applications are complex software systems for decision support in process operations and for process control. Each such application involves one or more computational modules being executed in an arbitrary realtime schedule, and communicating with each other and the external environment within which they are deployed. Each module may involve a mathematical computation based on a process model derived from firstprinciples or via machine learning applied to plant data; alternatively, it may have a purely statistical basis derived directly from plant data. There has been much progress in the use of such digital applications in industrial practice. However, achieving true scalability and sustainability in this direction will require general platforms that will allow the essentially code-free development of new applications and their large-scale deployments. We describe one such, recently developed, platform. We also consider the potential role of digital applications in the context of major trends in process operations, such as autonomous plant operation and process plant modularization.

TI  - Reloading Process Systems Engineering within Chemical Engineering
T2  - CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH & DESIGN
AB  - Established as a sub-discipline of Chemical Engineering in the 1960s by the late Professor R.W.H. Sargent at Imperial College London, Process Systems Engineering (PSE) has played a significant role in advancing the field, positioning it as a leading engineering discipline in the contemporary technological landscape. Rooted in Applied Mathematics and Computing, PSE aligns with the key components driving advancements in our modern, information-centric era. Sargent's visionary foresight anticipated the evolution of early computational tools into fundamental elements for future technological and scientific breakthroughs, all while maintaining a central focus on Chemical Engineering. This paper aims to present concise and concrete ideas for propelling PSE into a new era of progress. The objective is twofold: to preserve PSE's extensive and diverse knowledge base and to reposition it more prominently within modern Chemical Engineering, while also establishing robust connections with other data-driven engineering and applied science domains that play important roles in industrial and technological advancements. Rather than merely reacting to contemporary challenges, this article seeks to proactively create opportunities to lead the future of Chemical Engineering across its vital contributions in education, research, technology transfer, and business creation, fully leveraging its inherent multidisciplinarity and versatile character.

TI  - The Role of Modeling in the Analysis and Design of Sustainable Systems: A Panel Report
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB  - Sustainability should become a key concern in the next generation of engineered systems. While this expectation is relatively straightforward, the question of how to get there is less obvious. The multi-dimensional and intricate nature of sustainability poses challenges in designing sustainable systems and analyzing sustainability properties. Finding trade-offs between economic, environmental, societal, and technological aspects of sustainability is a wicked problem and calls for advanced modeling and simulation methods. In this paper, we report on a panel discussion held at the 28th Working Conference on Exploring Modeling Methods for Systems Analysis and Development (EMMSAD) with four esteemed experts representing four complementary and often conflicting perspectives on the role of modeling for sustainability - stakeholders, digitalization, degrowth and IT, and ethics. We report the key arguments of the panelists, discuss the roles of modeling in the analysis and design of sustainable systems, and, finally, elaborate on the conflicts among the perspectives, their effects, and potential resolutions.

TI  - A Physics-Based Model-Data-Driven Method for Spindle Health Diagnosis, Part II: Dynamic Simulation and Validation
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB  - Mathematical modeling of bearing faults, worn tool holder taper contact interface, and unbalance are presented and integrated into a digital dynamic model of spindles in Part I of this paper. These faults lead to changes in preload and dynamic stiffness over time, consequently resulting in observable vibrations. This paper predicts the vibrations of a spindle at a particular measurement location by simulating the presence of a specific fault or multiple faults during spindle rotation. The vibration spectra generated by the digital spindle model at the spindle speed and its harmonics, the changes in the natural frequencies, and dynamic stiffnesses are correlated to faults with experimental validations. The simulated vibration spectrums are later used in training an artificial neural network for fault condition monitoring presented in Part III of the paper.

TI  - A Physics-Based Model-Data-Driven Method for Spindle Health Diagnosis, Part I: Modeling of Geometric Faults
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB  - The spindle determines the performance of machine tools; hence, monitoring its health is essential to maintain machining productivity and avoid costly downtimes. The magnitudes and locations of wear and cracks in the bearing balls and races gradually develop which are difficult to detect. This article presents a physics-based digital model of the spindle with bearing faults, worn contact interface between the shaft and tool holder, and spindle imbalance. The wear of races and balls is considered in the bearing model. The worn taper contact interface and the spindle imbalance are included in the digital model. The spindle's dynamic model is used to simulate the vibrations at any location in the spindle assembly where sensors can be mounted for online monitoring. The wear type and bearing location are correlated with the frequency spectrum of vibrations at operating speeds. The proposed fault models are used to analyze the critical signal features and experimentally validated by the frequency extracted from a damaged spindle in Part II. The physics-based digital model is used to train data analytic models to detect spindle faults in Part III.

TI  - Inverse Mechanistic Modeling of Transdermal Drug Delivery for Fast Identification of Optimal Model Parameters
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Transdermal drug delivery systems are a key technology to administer drugs with a high first-pass effect in a non-invasive and controlled way. Physics-based modeling and simulation are on their way to become a cornerstone in the engineering of these healthcare devices since it provides a unique complementarity to experimental data and additional insights. Simulations enable to virtually probe the drug transport inside the skin at each point in time and space. However, the tedious experimental or numerical determination of material properties currently forms a bottleneck in the modeling workflow. We show that multiparameter inverse modeling to determine the drug diffusion and partition coefficients is a fast and reliable alternative. We demonstrate this strategy for transdermal delivery of fentanyl. We found that inverse modeling reduced the normalized root mean square deviation of the measured drug uptake flux from 26 to 9%, when compared to the experimental measurement of all skin properties. We found that this improved agreement with experiments was only possible if the diffusion in the reservoir holding the drug was smaller than the experimentally measured diffusion coefficients suggested. For indirect inverse modeling, which systematically explores the entire parametric space, 30,000 simulations were required. By relying on direct inverse modeling, we reduced the number of simulations to be performed to only 300, so a factor 100 difference. The modeling approach's added value is that it can be calibrated once in-silico for all model parameters simultaneously by solely relying on a single measurement of the drug uptake flux evolution over time. We showed that this calibrated model could accurately be used to simulate transdermal patches with other drug doses. We showed that inverse modeling is a fast way to build up an accurate mechanistic model for drug delivery. This strategy opens the door to clinically ready therapy that is tailored to patients.

TI  - Clinically-Driven Virtual Patient Cohorts Generation: An Application to Aorta
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - The combination of machine learning methods together with computational modeling and simulation of the cardiovascular system brings the possibility of obtaining very valuable information about new therapies or clinical devices through in-silico experiments. However, the application of machine learning methods demands access to large cohorts of patients. As an alternative to medical data acquisition and processing, which often requires some degree of manual intervention, the generation of virtual cohorts made of synthetic patients can be automated. However, the generation of a synthetic sample can still be computationally demanding to guarantee that it is clinically meaningful and that it reflects enough inter-patient variability. This paper addresses the problem of generating virtual patient cohorts of thoracic aorta geometries that can be used for in-silico trials. In particular, we focus on the problem of generating a cohort of patients that meet a particular clinical criterion, regardless the access to a reference sample of that phenotype. We formalize the problem of clinically-driven sampling and assess several sampling strategies with two goals, sampling efficiency, i.e., that the generated individuals actually belong to the target population, and that the statistical properties of the cohort can be controlled. Our results show that generative adversarial networks can produce reliable, clinically-driven cohorts of thoracic aortas with good efficiency. Moreover, non-linear predictors can serve as an efficient alternative to the sometimes expensive evaluation of anatomical or functional parameters of the organ of interest.

TI  - On the Data-Driven Modeling of Reactive Extrusion
T2  - FLUIDS
AB  - This paper analyzes the ability of different machine learning techniques, able to operate in the low-data limit, for constructing the model linking material and process parameters with the properties and performances of parts obtained by reactive polymer extrusion. The use of data-driven approaches is justified by the absence of reliable modeling and simulation approaches able to predict induced properties in those complex processes. The experimental part of this work is based on the in situ synthesis of a thermoset (TS) phase during the mixing step with a thermoplastic polypropylene (PP) phase in a twin-screw extruder. Three reactive epoxy/amine systems have been considered and anhydride maleic grafted polypropylene (PP-g-MA) has been used as compatibilizer. The final objective is to define the appropriate processing conditions in terms of improving the mechanical properties of these new PP materials by reactive extrusion.

TI  - Modeling and simulation of complex manufacturing phenomena using sensor signals from the perspective of Industry 4.0
T2  - ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS
AB  - This article presents a methodology defined as semantic modeling to create computable virtual abstractions of complex manufacturing phenomena denoted as phenomena twins from the perspective of the fourth industrial revolution (also known as Smart Manufacturing, Connected Factory, Industry 4.0, and so forth). The twins are created such that they become friendly to both sensor signals and new-generation web technology (i.e., the semantic web). The efficacy of the proposed modeling approach is demonstrated by creating a phenomenon twin of cutting force (a highly complex and stochastic phenomenon associated with all material removal processes) and also by representing it using the semantic web. The relevant epistemological and systemological issues (e.g., those of meta-models, ontology, classification/trustworthiness/provenance of knowledge associated with the webized phenomenon twin) are also discussed. This article will help developers of embedded (e.g., cyber-physical) systems needed for functionalizing Industry 4.0.

TI  - Health Technology Assessment for In Silico Medicine: Social, Ethical and Legal Aspects
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The application of in silico medicine is constantly growing in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. These technologies allow us to support medical decisions and self-management and reduce, refine, and partially replace real studies of medical technologies. In silico medicine may challenge some key principles: transparency and fairness of data usage; data privacy and protection across platforms and systems; data availability and quality; data integration and interoperability; intellectual property; data sharing; equal accessibility for persons and populations. Several social, ethical, and legal issues may consequently arise from its adoption. In this work, we provide an overview of these issues along with some practical suggestions for their assessment from a health technology assessment perspective. We performed a narrative review with a search on MEDLINE/Pubmed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The following key aspects emerge as general reflections with an impact on the operational level: cultural resistance, level of expertise of users, degree of patient involvement, infrastructural requirements, risks for health, respect of several patients' rights, potential discriminations for access and use of the technology, and intellectual property of innovations. Our analysis shows that several challenges still need to be debated to allow in silico medicine to express all its potential in healthcare processes.

TI  - A Framework for Tolerance Modeling Based on Parametric Space Envelope
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB  - Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) tolerance standards are widely used in industries across the world. A mathematical model to formulate tolerance specifications to enable comprehensive tolerance analysis is highly desirable but difficult to build. Existing methods have limited success on this with form and profile tolerance modeling as a known challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel tolerance modeling framework and methodology based upon parametric space envelope, a purposely built variation tool constructed from base parametric curve. Under proposal, geometric variation (deviation as well as deformation) is modeled and linked to envelope boundary control points' movement. This indirect tolerance modeling brings various benefits. It is versatile and can handle full set of tolerances specified under GD&T standards including form, profile, and runout tolerance. The proposal can deal with complex manufacturing part and is capable of providing modeling accuracy required by many applications. The proposed approach has added advantage of facilitating integration of various computer-aided systems to meet emerging industry demands on tolerancing in a new era of digital manufacturing. The proposed methodology is illustrated and verified with an industrial case example on a two-part assembly.

As the core of smart manufacturing systems, intelligent services stand a significant role in the analysis, prediction, and adjustment of production process, which is inseparable from the effective semantic modeling of the procedures and elements involved. However, there is an absence of unified modeling of assembly process, including both geometric and non-geometric information, leading to the incomprehensiveness when providing data support for intelligent services. To fill this gap, a generic node2vecbased parameterized representation of geometric elements and assembly constraints approach is proposed. Firstly, the information structure of assembly process is established, in which the geometric elements and topological relationships of the product are abstracted into a network. Secondly, node2vec is adopted for the graph embedding to generate preset dimension vectors corresponding to the nodes in the geometric network. As the edges in the network, the vectors corresponding to the assembly constraints, which are regarded as the parameterized representations, can be obtained through node vector calculation. Moreover, an assembly workstep execution time prediction method based on historical data is introduced with the parameterized representations of assembly constraints as the carriers of geometric topological information. At last, an industrial case study is illustrated to show the entire process of constraint parameterized representations and workstep execution time prediction, indicating the feasibility and availability of the method proposed.

TI  - General Survey of Engineering Electromagnetic and Thermal Field Problems
T2  - MODELING AND APPLICATION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC AND THERMAL FIELD IN ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - A number of key problems in the modeling and application of engineering electromagnetic and thermal fields, involving the advanced material property modeling under complex working conditions, the efficient analysis method and simulation software, and the rigorous examination of the effectiveness and usefulness of large-scale modeling and simulation, are briefly outlined. Based on the industrial background in large power transformers, considering the rapid development of modern transmission and transformation technology and equipment, the major and very challenging research projects, mainly concerned with the modeling and prediction of transformer core loss and stray-field loss, and the multi-physics simulation requirements, for addressing the heating and cooling issues, are highlighted. This chapter provides a short overview of the evolution of modeling and simulation worldwide and stresses that today the simulation of the electromagnetic and thermal fields can be performed with considerable accuracy, even though there are still some important studies that need to continue. Finally, the overall composition of this book is introduced.

TI  - COMPARING vaccine manufacturing technologies recombinant DNA vs in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Vaccine manufacturing fosters the prevention, control, and eradication of infectious diseases. Recombinant DNA and in vitro (IVT) mRNA vaccine manufacturing technologies were enforced to combat the recent pandemic. Despite the impact of these technologies, there exists no scientific announcement that compares them. Digital Shadows are employed in this study to simulate each technology, investigating root cause deviations, technical merits, and liabilities, evaluating cost scenarios. Under this lens we provide an unbiased, advanced comparative technoeconomic study, one that determines which of these manufacturing platforms are suited for the two types of vaccines considered (monoclonal antibodies or antigens). We find recombinant DNA technology to exhibit higher Profitability Index due to lower capital and starting material requirements, pertaining to lower Minimum Selling Price per Dose values, delivering products of established quality. However, the potency of the mRNA, the streamlined and scalable synthetic processes involved and the raw material availability, facilitate faster market penetration and product flexibility, constituting these vaccines preferable whenever short product development cycles become a necessity.

TI  - In-process identification of feed drive dynamics considering machining forces
T2  - PRECISION ENGINEERING-JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETIES FOR PRECISION ENGINEERING AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - This paper presents a new closed-loop dynamics model for ballscrew feed drives in CNC machine tools, enabling non-intrusive, in-process model calibration and motion prediction even in the presence of unmeasured machining forces. The presented model employs a Partially Linear Auto-Regressive with Exogenous input (PL-ARX) structure, where the linear component captures the servo drive and rigid-body dynamics, and the nonlinear component represents unknown machining forces. Kernel-based regression is then used to simultaneously identify the linear dynamics and machining force disturbances from internal controller signals during milling. The model is validated on two different CNC machines under experimental milling conditions. Results confirm the approach accurately identifies unbiased linear dynamics despite unmeasured disturbances and achieves precise online motion prediction. These capabilities are critical for enabling real-time feedrate optimization and model-predictive control in advanced machining systems.

TI  - Metaverse for the Energy Industry: Technologies, Applications, and Solutions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS
AB  - The Metaverse refers to the integration of physical and virtual realities, offering new possibilities for enhancing operations and services across various industries. However, its application in the energy sector is still in its nascent stage. The energy industry, crucial for the global economy and society, faces significant challenges due to its complex and risky nature, such as health, safety, and environmental (HSE) concerns, and the remote locations of extraction sites. Although some studies have explored the use of the Metaverse in this industry for data visualization, energy process modeling, and training, a comprehensive review of existing technologies and applications is lacking. This article addresses this gap by examining the potential of the Metaverse for the energy industry, using the Oil&Gas sector as a case study. We identify the essential technologies needed to create a realistic and immersive Metaverse experience and review the current literature on its industrial applications in the energy sector. Distinguishing our work from others, we present four practical case studies developed from our own experience in the Oil&Gas sector. These cases demonstrate the tangible benefits of Metaverse solutions in improving operational efficiency, reducing costs, and enhancing worker safety and productivity, highlighting the unique value of the Metaverse in addressing industry-specific challenges.

TI  - Robust Contact Computation in Non-Rigid Variation Simulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING
AB  - In non-rigid variation simulation, contact modeling is used to avoid the virtual penetration of the components in the adjacent areas. Numerical errors and convergence issues due to the deformation behavior of the interacting surfaces are limiting the computational efficiency of solving the contact problem. In this paper, a quadratic programming approach has been introduced based on the Lagrangian multiplier method for robust contact modeling in non-rigid variation simulation, and the performance of the proposed approach has been compared to the previously applied iterative and barrier function methods. The methods have been compared on three industrial reference cases, and the convergence and time-efficiency of each method are compared. The results show that robust optimization of the quadratic program associated with the contact model is highly dependent on the reduced stiffness matrix condition. Furthermore, it has been shown that robust and efficient contact computation in non-rigid variation simulation is achievable through the proposed augmented Lagrangian method.

TI  - Developing an IoT-enabled probabilistic model for quick identification of hidden radioactive materials in maritime port operations to strengthen global supply chain security
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEFENSE MODELING AND SIMULATION-APPLICATIONS METHODOLOGY TECHNOLOGY-JDMS
AB  - Uncovering hidden radioactive materials continues to be a major hurdle in worldwide supply chains. Recent research has not adequately investigated practical Internet of Things (IoT)-based approaches for improving and implementing efficient data fusion techniques. Current systems often misuse resources, leading to security vulnerabilities in typical settings. Our research delves into the fundamental principles of detection using both single and multiple sensor configurations, adopting a probabilistic method for merging data. We introduce a model aimed at accelerating the detection of radiation emissions in actual port operations. The results highlight the model's effectiveness in rapid identification and determine the best conditions for its application in scenarios involving stacked containers, whether they are on ships or positioned in storage areas.

TI  - A Simulation-Based Framework for Manufacturing Design and Resilience Assessment: A Case Study in the Wood Sector
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - The advent of modern digital technologies offers new opportunities to improve the performance of manufacturing systems from design to monitoring and control during operation. At the same time, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the fragility of all global supply chains and manufacturing systems. In this paper, a simulation-based framework, exploiting the benefits of the digital model concept, is proposed. It aims at: (1) supporting manufacturing design to effectively start a new business, (2) assessing the resilience of a manufacturing system in the face of disruptions, (3) evaluating the goodness of possible strategies to deal with COVID-like crises. The validity of the proposed framework is successfully demonstrated through a real-life case study, referring to the wood sector. The results show that a lack of system preparedness can lead to productivity reductions of up to 31.8%. At the same time, having the ability to react to unexpected events can limit damage and increase productivity by 26% compared to not reacting.

TI  - Systematic Literature Review on Multi-Objective Simulation Optimization
T2  - COMPLEX SYSTEM MODELING AND SIMULATION
AB  - Simulation optimization is a rapidly growing research field, fueled by advances in computational technology. These advances have made it possible to solve complex stochastic optimization problems through simulation. While most published articles focus on single-objective optimization, multl-objective optimization is gaining prominence, allowing the approach of real-world problems that present multiple, conflicting objectives. In this context, the objective of this article was to conduct a systematic literature review to identify articles that present solution methods for Multi-Objective Simulation Optimization (MOSO) problems. The focus was on practical optimization applications in conjunction with Discrete Event Simulation (DES) models, aiming to identify the main aspects of the problems addressed, the methods used, and research opportunities, contributing to future projects. By exploring the characteristics of MOSO problems associated with DES and the applied solution methods, this article innovatively presents a guide to help professionals improve their decision-making processes and assist researchers in developing new research.

TI  - Potential of Integrating Model-Based Design of Experiments Approaches and Process Analytical Technologies for Bioprocess Scale-Down
T2  - DIGITAL TWINS: APPLICATIONS TO THE DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION OF BIOPROCESSES
AB  - Typically, bioprocesses on an industrial scale are dynamic systems with a certain degree of variability, system inhomogeneities, and even population heterogeneities. Therefore, the scaling of such processes from laboratory to industrial scale and vice versa is not a trivial task. Traditional scale-down methodologies consider several technical parameters, so that systems on the laboratory scale tend to qualitatively reflect large-scale effects, but not the dynamic situation in an industrial bioreactor over the entire process, from the perspective of a cell. Supported by the enormous increase in computing power, the latest scientific focus is on the application of dynamic models, in combination with computational fluid dynamics to quantitatively describe cell behavior. These models allow the description of possible cellular lifelines which in turn can be used to derive a regime analysis for scale-down experiments. However, the approaches described so far, which were for a very few process examples, are very labor- and time-intensive and cannot be validated easily. In parallel, alternatives have been developed based on the description of the industrial process with hybrid process models, which describe a process mechanistically as far as possible in order to determine the essential process parameters with their respective variances. On-line analytical methods allow the characterization of population heterogeneity directly in the process. This detailed information from the industrial process can be used in laboratory screening systems to select relevant conditions in which the cell and process related parameters reflect the situation in the industrial scale. In our opinion, these technologies, which are available in research for modeling biological systems, in combination with process analytical techniques are so far developed that they can be implemented in industrial routines for faster development of new processes and optimization of existing ones.
