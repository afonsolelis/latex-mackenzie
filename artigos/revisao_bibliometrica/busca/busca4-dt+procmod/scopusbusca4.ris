AB  - Despite recent advances in Digital Twin (DT) technologies for semiconductor manufacturing, no existing research convincingly demonstrates a unified, rapidly scalable, and data-efficient DT framework that can effectively handle stringent multi-objective optimization under severe data scarcity. This absence of a comprehensive approach impedes widespread industry adoption, given the pressing need for flexible, universal solutions that rapidly adapt to diverse machines and processes. This study introduces MOODFG-MLTL, an innovative algorithm that integrates Meta-Learning and Transfer Learning within a Multi-Objective Optimization using Deep-Feature Gaussian Processes (MOODFG) architecture. By harnessing a centralized meta-model repository and dynamically refining surrogate models, the proposed framework efficiently leverages limited data and transfers knowledge across heterogeneous manufacturing configurations. In our experimental validation with Epi SiC processes, MOODFG-MLTL achieves near-optimal wafer thickness and doping control using only 15 samples—reducing data requirements by approximately 50% while converging up to 40% faster compared to conventional approaches. Experimental validation in epitaxial silicon carbide (Epi SiC) scenarios demonstrates that the MOODFG-MLTL not only maintains robust performance under constrained data conditions but also accelerates the deployment of data-efficient, multi-objective DT solutions. This advancement provides a critical foundation for achieving universal, intelligent DT implementations in the semiconductor industry’s evolving landscape. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Business process modeling is one of the most important steps in managing the lifecycle of a business process. A digital twin of a business process is a virtual model of a business process designed to replicate the behavior of a real business process. The difference between a digital twin and a business process simulation is that the simulation does not require real-time data, while a digital twin is created based on real-time data. A digital twin comprises a physical entity in the real world, a software-based digital counterpart, and the data that links them both. When a created process communicates in real time with IoT devices and adapts its execution based on the information received in real time, this is referred to as a process digital twin. As the field of digital twins becomes increasingly popular, the challenge is to investigate how the process digital twin communicates with IoT devices in real time and updates its execution state. © 2024 Snježana Križanić & Neven Vrček; published by UIKTEN.

AB  - The digital twin (DT), as a dynamic intelligence system that organically combines virtual and realistic models and multiple sources of data, fully combines numerical models with real-world data to monitor the operational status of products and predict their lifespan. Therefore, a system modeling approach with high fidelity and timeliness is of great significance for DT models. However, most current DT modeling approaches focus on individual objects and individual aspects of a product, while being deficient in a full lifecycle and multi-object-oriented modeling approach, which is not conducive to the mining and utilization of data on the whole product. Given this challenge, a product-level DT modeling approach based on PLM/PDM theory is proposed in this paper. It combines property model, simulation model, process model, status model, quality model, and feedback model through a digital thread communication framework to collect and utilize product lifecycle data to achieve accurate control of all aspects of the product lifecycle. The product-level DT results are presented by a visualization platform that enables interaction between customers, designers, and fabricators under real-time monitoring of the product manufacturing process throughout the system. Finally, a test case of a wind energy generator was performed to validate the proposed product-level DT modeling approach. The results revealed that the proposed approach is effective and feasible. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - Sustainability is a key challenge today. The high emission impact of the mobility sector requires a shift from internal combustion engines to electric traction motors. In order to improve sustainability holistically, the entire lifecycle from raw materials, manufacturing, use and end-of-life must be considered during development. Although a lot can be carried out to influence sustainability during the development phase, knowledge about the product is still very limited. Considering the main lifecycle stages already during the development phase requires a systematic development approach. Furthermore, integrating data from previous product generations is required. Generating a digital twin which collects data over the lifecycle is a useful tool which enables the prediction of evaluation criteria for the lifecycle stages. However, when using the digital twin, a suitable description model needs to be generated. A cross-lifecycle evaluation model based on Life Cycle Costing (LCC) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was used to evaluate sustainability throughout the whole lifecycle. Information for evaluation was generated using a cross-lifecycle modeling approach, which enabled the combination of different lifecycle perspectives during development. To show the potential of evaluating different solutions from different perspectives, the methodology was demonstrated with a lightweight rotor of an electric traction motor. The great potential of the process model is shown. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Modern large complex buildings, with their vast expanses and multipurpose usability, present diverse fire-spread scenarios, necessitating precise awareness of fire situations. Despite numerous studies integrating building information models with IoT and AI technologies to provide contextual information, there may be limitations in recognizing potential risks under dynamic fire behaviors during urgent situations. This paper presents a fire emergency management system based on an informative digital twin (IDT) to provide instantaneous fire situational information. Utilizing IDT, the system gathers building-specific fire scenario knowledge for immediate fire recognition. Leveraging this knowledge, the IDT assesses building fire risks and shares safety information on egress routes and zones with fire-related applications. A simulation case study revealed a fire recognition processing time of 0.88 s, acceptable for fire emergencies. Additionally, the IDT's risk assessment reduced the total evacuation time by 65 s and potential injuries by 406, demonstrating the system's effectiveness in fire emergency management. © 2024

AB  - Rapid advances in digital twin (DT) provide an unprecedented opportunity to derive data-enabled intelligence for smart manufacturing. However, traditional DT is more concerned about real-time data streaming, dashboard visualization, and predictive analytics, but focuses less on multiagent intelligence. This limitation hampers the development of agentic intelligence for decentralized decision-making in complex manufacturing environments. Therefore, this article presents a cognitive digital twin (CDT) approach for multiobjective production scheduling through decentralized, collaborative multiagent learning. First, we propose to construct models of heterogeneous agents (e.g., machines, jobs, automated guided vehicles, and automated storage and retrieval systems) that interact with physical and digital twins. Second, multiobjective optimization is embedded in CDT to align production schedules with diverse and often conflicting objectives such as throughput, task transition efficiency, and workload balance. Third, we develop a multiagent learning approach to enable decentralized decision-making in response to unexpected disruptions and dynamic demands. Each agent operates independently and collaboratively with cognitive capabilities, including perception, learning, and reasoning, to optimize the individual agentic objective while contributing to overarching system-wide goals. Finally, the proposed CDT is evaluated and validated with experimental studies in a learning factory environment. Experimental results demonstrate that CDT improves operational performance in terms of task allocation, resource utilization, and system resilience compared to traditional centralized approaches. This initial study of CDT highlights the potential to bring multiagent cognitive intelligence into next-generation smart manufacturing. © 2025 by ASME.

AB  - The study is focused on the application of the electronic proof of concept Digital Twin (DT) model supporting Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal detection and interpretation. The EEG DT model integrates two open source tools: a first tool used for the circuit modeling and simulation of the electrodes, and a second one implementing an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-supervised algorithm to classify and adjust a noisy EEG signal. Specifically, the DT model adopts the Random Forest (RF) AI-supervised algorithm, replacing the signal filtering process and facilitating the time–domain peak and the wave shape morphology reading of a noisy detection. In order to prove the DT’s efficacy, the RF model is trained by considering the specific case of detections of EEG of patients under the effects of alcohol. The choice of the RF algorithm is justified by its good performance parameters. For the specific dataset, the RF exhibits a probabilistic error slightly lower than that of the ANN and a better cleaning action. The goal of the paper is to provide a methodology to use ‘intelligent’ electrodes supporting EEG data processing during data acquisition and to optimize the measurement’s interpretation through a data post-processing process. The proposed EEG DT could represent an alternative to the traditional denoising signal processing approaches. © 2025 by the author.

AB  - Driven by the technological impetus of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the oil and gas drilling industry is rapidly advancing towards informatization, digitization, and intelligentization, with drilling digital twin technology emerging as a frontier and hotspot in the field. Drilling digital twin technology aims to map real drilling operations into virtual space and establish integrated, multi-disciplinary, multi-physical, and multi-scale virtual simulation models throughout the entire lifecycle of drilling. This enables functions such as pre-drilling rehearsal, in-drilling optimization, and post-drilling analysis, ensuring safe, efficient, and cost-effective drilling while enhancing the drilling efficiency of complex oil and gas formation. The current application status of digital twin technology in drilling engineering was introduced, and drilling digital twins were categorized into rig digital twins and wellbore digital twins. A five-dimensional system architecture for drilling digital twins was proposed. Furthermore, future development trends in drilling digital twins were analyzed, including real-time and efficient transmission of drilling data, refinement and quantification of geological models, multi-domain integrated modeling and simulation, dynamic adaptive updating of simulation models, the integration of mechanistic and data-driven modeling, safe and efficient human-machine interaction, and cloud-edge collaborative software system architecture. Relevant suggestions for the development of drilling digital twin technology in China were also proposed. The research findings could serve as a reference for establishing a drilling digital twin technology system and provide guidance for promoting intelligent innovation in the drilling industry. © 2024 Science China Press.

AB  - Complex surfaces are increasingly used in optics, biomedical devices, and aerospace industries. Additive manufacturing and five-axis milling can produce complex shapes, but additional finishing processes are needed to meet the surface quality demands. This keynote paper reviews shape-adaptive finishing processes that enable uniform surface quality improvement without altering the shape. Key factors affecting shape adaptability, processing efficiency, and material applicability are analyzed and optimal process selection strategies for finishing complex surfaces are discussed. Future possibilities and research topics in this area, including process modeling/simulation, digital twin, surface/subsurface metrology, functionality evaluation, and applications of advanced robotics and artificial intelligence, are outlined. © 2025 The Author(s)

AB  - Mathematical modeling of bearing faults, worn tool holder taper contact interface, and unbalance are presented and integrated into a digital dynamic model of spindles in Part I of this paper. These faults lead to changes in preload and dynamic stiffness over time, consequently resulting in observable vibrations. This paper predicts the vibrations of a spindle at a particular measurement location by simulating the presence of a specific fault or multiple faults during spindle rotation. The vibration spectra generated by the digital spindle model at the spindle speed and its harmonics, the changes in the natural frequencies, and dynamic stiffnesses are correlated to faults with experimental validations. The simulated vibration spectrums are later used in training an artificial neural network for fault condition monitoring presented in Part III of the paper. © 2024 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

AB  - This research presents an advanced autonomous HVAC control system tailored for a chemical fiber factory, emphasizing the human-centric principles and collaborative potential of Industry 5.0. The system architecture employs several functional levels—actuator and sensor, process, model, critic, fault detection, and specification—to effectively monitor and predict indoor air pressure differences, which are critical for maintaining consistent product quality. Central to the system’s innovation is the integration of digital twins and physical AI, enhancing real-time monitoring and predictive capabilities. A virtual representation runs in parallel with the physical system, enabling sophisticated simulation and optimization. Development involved custom sensor kit design, embedded systems, IoT integration leveraging Node-RED for data streaming, and InfluxDB for time-series data storage. AI-driven system identification using Nonlinear Autoregressive with eXogenous inputs (NARX) neural network models significantly improved accuracy. Crucially, incorporating airflow velocity data alongside AHU output and past pressure differences boosted the NARX model’s predictive performance (R2 up to 0.9648 on test data). Digital twins facilitate scenario testing and optimization, while physical AI allows the system to learn from real-time data and simulations, ensuring adaptive control and continuous improvement for enhanced operational stability in complex industrial settings. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - To address the inefficiencies in asphalt pavement modeling and the challenges of integrating design with structural calculations, an automated framework that connects Building Information Modeling (BIM) to the Finite Element Method (FEM) was proposed for evaluating asphalt pavement design solutions and verifying structural optimization. This framework enables precise interaction between BIM and FEM through material attribute assignment, high-quality meshing, application of environmental and load conditions, and rutting calculations. By collecting on-site road temperatures and material parameters and entering them into the BIM-FEM framework, the permanent deformation of the asphalt layer was calculated and the reliability of the framework was validated. Results indicate a simulation error of just 2.12 %, with efficiency improved by 68.66 % and accuracy enhanced by 54.89 % compared to recent research. The accuracy and efficiency of modeling and simulation in large-scale road engineering projects were significantly enhanced by this framework to support the digital twin management of road engineering. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

We developed an industrial process model for a plant processing 2000 ton/h geothermal brine using chemical precipitation to produce lithium carbonate, coupled with techno-economic and life cycle assessments to evaluate process economics and environmental impacts. A novel recycling process for on-site reuse of precipitating agents is also proposed, increasing total investment cost by 23% while reducing CO2 emissions by nearly 50% without extending the payback period. Additionally, we investigated the impact of feedstock concentration and water costs on process economics. Our findings show that low-concentration lithium brines (less than 200 mg/L) are economically viable only at high lithium carbonate selling prices. This study highlights the potential of geothermal brines as a sustainable lithium source and the benefits of integrating recycling processes to mitigate environmental concerns. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Damper assemblies are often tested on test benches with relatively large displacement amplitudes at high velocities. Stochastic excitations, as road irregularities can usually be described, have a high proportion of amplitudes with small excitations; the so-called small signals. Testing with small signals poses special challenges for test benches. A methodology is presented that uses a quarter vehicle model and synthetically generated road irregularities to estimate the displacement, velocity, and acceleration amplitudes occurring at a damper assembly model. In order to describe a more realistic vehicle behavior, the synthetically generated road irregularities undergo a reduction of the amplitudes in corresponding frequency ranges by means of linear filters. The evaluation of the amplitudes occurring at the damper assembly is used to make a selection of the actuator for the test bench. A nonlinear dynamic model of the test bench, a so-called “Digital Twin,” is then created, which focuses on both, the model of the permanent magnet synchronous machine and the mechanical model of the linear actuator. Furthermore, a controller optimization procedure is used to virtually optimize the test bench’s controller parameters. Using the optimized parameters after the build process of the test bench, damper assembly tests with small signals of high quality are possible. With the help of virtual development methods such as synthetically created filtered road irregularities and with a Digital Twin of the test bench, a fast test bench development is possible. Realistic results can be achieved. © IMechE 2023.

AB  - Digital twins have emerged as highly valuable tools for model-based planning, simulation and optimization over the last couple of years, thereby demonstrating considerable potential for application within the construction industry. The introduction of building information modeling (BIM) has effectively established a standardized approach to representing building models. However, in practice, many of these models currently exhibit limitations as to their quality, specifically concerning the level of detail they encompass. In addition, BIM models too often are locked inside a specific vendor’s tool which readily implies a lack of platform independence, or interoperability, which, however, is essential for facilitating single and regressive, i.e., after a design change, model-based building performance simulations. Model-based engineering has effectively addressed comparable challenges within the domain of software engineering over the past decades by facilitating the integration and interoperability of models from various origins, by capitalizing on model-based tool integration. Prompted by these advantages, this study introduces a model-based tool environment that addresses the aforesaid challenges concerning BIM model quality and interoperability. Taking advantage of our proposed model-based tool environment, we implement an agile, continuous planning process for regressive, model-based building performance simulations, thereby enhancing building energy efficiency planning. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This paper presents a flexible heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) modeling framework developed for building digital twin implementation. The framework is showcased for the modeling and simulation of four ventilation systems in a 8500 m2 university building. The developed model includes multiple objective model predictive control (MPC) with three objectives: electricity cost, indoor air quality and CO2 emission attributed to electricity consumption. A control strategy comparison is conducted between several MPC solutions with different objective weightings and a rule-based control strategy, which emulates the current system control. A novel approach for air quality evaluation is proposed and used for the MPC modeling and strategy comparison in this study. In this comparison, a “balanced” MPC strategy reduces energy costs by 18% compared to rule-based control while also providing significantly better air quality. An economic strategy achieves 24% savings with some air quality reduction, while an air-quality-focused strategy provides nearly “perfect” air quality with 11% savings. Finally, an environmental strategy shows the potential for prioritizing CO2 emissions over electricity costs. In this way, the strategy comparison illustrates the potential of MPC for the efficient operation and flexible objective prioritization according to stakeholder interests. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - The projection indicates that by 2025, more than 41.6 billion IoT devices will be active, generating a staggering 80 zettabytes (ZB) of data collectively. Despite the widespread integration of smart devices across various sectors like smart homes, wearable's, smart cities, and workplaces, the mining industry has been comparatively slow in adopting innovative technologies. However, it is essential to recognize the vital role played by the mining sector in powering energy systems, manufacturing components for smart devices, and employing over 4.5 million individuals globally, often in demanding and harsh conditions. This paper presents a prototype Industrial IoT and Digital Twin platform to optimize industrial automation in traditional mining operations. Moreover, it proposes a digital twin reference architecture employing Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) and simulation techniques to validate the reference architecture within a mining context. The results indicate an impressive 98% accuracy achieved within a time frame of 10.25 s. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The simulation experiment evaluates whether the business process model accurately replicates real-world operations and whether the digital twin functions in real-time. A digital twin of a production business process is a virtual representation of its real-world counterpart. Its aim is to monitor the execution of the actual production business process in order to detect irregularities and production downtimes early and respond promptly by making optimal decisions. This paper presents the position of digital twins of business processes in relation to business process documentation, business process simulations, and the execution of process-oriented applications. The research problem is that existing business process management methodologies are not designed for the development of digital twins of business processes, and there is no established methodology that outlines the process of creating a digital twin of a production business process. The aim of this research paper is to introduce a methodology for developing production digital twins using the simulation experiment method. The significance of the proposed methodology lies in overcoming the limitations of current business process management approaches, which lack adequate support for developing digital twins. Therefore, it is important to enhance existing business process management methodologies to align them with modern requirements, particularly in the rapidly evolving domain of Smart Industry. To validate the proposed methodology, a digital twin model was developed for a private, non-profit organization operating a smart factory that produces drones. The results of the comparison between the simulated model and the production digital twin show no deviations in process duration between these two models. Additionally, the digital twin of the production business process accurately reflects its real-world counterpart in real time. © 2025 Snježana Križanić and Neven Vrček.

AB  - In this work, the authors describe a concept called Virtual Mass Balance and its applicability to oil and gas fields. This study relies on data modelling and data engineering to enrich operational data and achieve digitized Material Balance Tables for monitoring and benchmarking purposes. A data-driven set of stream properties allow for the calculation of newly proposed soft sensors, which are subsequently used for predictive functionalities. The implementation of this concept has proven popular in an industry set of tools, AVEVA PI. The concept could be classified as an Enriched Digital Twin. Incorporating the DEXPI Process model and deploying proposed soft sensors could, on the one hand, combine both asset and operational characteristics. On the other hand, its simplicity and moderate level of detail can be much easier to implement and would show flexible applicability at various corporate levels. The application of the Tennessee Eastman Process proves its flexibility. The presented soft sensors exhibit good monitoring capabilities and, furthermore, allow for the application of data-driven artificial intelligence methods without a reduction in model clarity for operational staff. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Robotic additive manufacturing using a cold spray deposition head attached to a robotic arm can deposit material in a solid state with deposition rates in kilogrammes per hour. Under such a high deposition rate, the complicated interplay between the robot's motion, gun standoff distance, spray angle, overlapping, and the interaction of supersonic powder particles with a growing structure could cause overabundance or deficiency of material build-up. Over time, the accumulation of these discrepancies can negatively affect the overall shape and size of the final manufactured object. In-process spatio-temporal 3D reconstruction, also known as 4D reconstruction, could allow for early detection of deviations from the design, thus providing the opportunity to rectify at an early stage, making the process more robust, efficient and productive. However, in-process model reconstruction is challenging due to the dynamic nature of the scene (e.g. sensor and object relative movements), the three-dimensional growth of a time-varying build object, the textureless nature of build surfaces, and its computational complexity. We propose a real-time, in-process 4D reconstruction framework for free-form additive manufacturing processes, such as cold spray that deals with a real-time dynamic and evolving scene built by incremental deposition of materials. In our approach, temporal point clouds from three cameras are acquired and segmented to extract the region of interest (build object). The subsequent multi-temporal and multi-camera registration of the segmented 3D data is addressed by combining geometrically constrained Fiducial marker tracking and plane-based registration without drift accumulation. Finally, the registered point clouds are fused via voxel fusion of growing parts to reconstruct the 3D model of the object with smoothened surfaces. The proposed solution is deployed and verified in a robotic cold spray cell with different test scenarios and shape complexities. © 2024

AB  - This study addresses the challenges associated with virtual–real interactions, the limitations of one-dimensional data presentation, restricted real-time functionalities, and the lack of effective models for monitoring production line status. It specifically investigates intelligent production lines for automotive wheels as the focal point of the research. This study explores the construction methodology and the application of intelligent production lines through the utilization of digital twin technology. A hierarchical design approach is employed, integrating industrial Internet of Things (IoT) technology to create a comprehensive digital twin system. This system consists of four layers: the physical production line layer, the data acquisition and processing layer, the digital twin production line layer, and the application service layer. Precise mapping from the physical production line to the digital twin model is achieved using the advanced 3D modeling and simulation software, PQ Factory, while real-time data collection and transmission are facilitated through the standardized OPC UA protocol. The effectiveness of the system is substantiated through a detailed case study. The findings demonstrate that the intelligent production line system, which leverages digital twin technology for automotive wheels, enables real-time monitoring of the production process and provides innovative solutions, along with a robust theoretical framework for comprehensive analysis, diagnosis, evaluation, optimization, prediction, and decision making in the production of automotive wheels. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Laser micro-welding is a joining technology utilized across various high-value industries, like medical, automotive, e-mobility, and aerospace. A trial-and-error process to identify welding parameters does not necessarily lead to optimized quality levels. Furthermore, offline non-destructive examination methods often launched to verify welding quality may inadvertently trigger excessive costs and time delays, ultimately failing to guarantee defect-free welds. In response to these challenges, this article introduces an advanced multiscale model designed to unravel the intricate dynamics of hydrodynamics and the overarching physics within laser micro-welding melting pools. Developed using the COMSOL software package, the model adeptly demonstrates how surface tension gradients shape the geometry of welds, thus influencing their quality. This knowledge allows the mapping of welding defects. One of the novelties of the article is to introduce geometric dissimilar welding conditions by simulating an asymmetric edge joint. It shows a study on a new, unstudied way to laser weld with many applications in the field. The model further establishes its utility in design experiments to determine parameter, tolerance, and system design. Moreover, the insights garnered from understanding and controlling these drivers have far-reaching implications for the advancement of subsequent methodological research and the development of in-situ quality control practices by characterizing the welding defects. Finally, the results shows that the discouragingly high computational costs restrict its potential application to support a Digital Twin. © IMechE 2024.

AB  - Digital twin development of industrial cyber-physical systems requires modeling, simulation, and monitoring to provide accurate digital replicas mimicking system dynamics. To this aim, modern solutions employ data-driven approaches to capture normal system dynamics using historical data, and anomaly detection using run-time data. However, these approaches are typically process-agnostic and have limited explainability, which negatively impacts trustworthiness. Hence, we propose a novel framework for the digital twin development of industrial cyber-physical systems based on process mining, which connects data-driven and process-based analyses. The framework implements an offline phase that systematically identifies the most suitable process model to capture normal dynamics and simulates faulty dynamics for what-if analysis. The subsequent online phase involves run-time monitoring for anomaly detection. We develop a proof-of-concept application of the framework addressing a water distribution case study that allows physical fault injection. Results highlight the importance of adopting high-quality process models to significantly improve anomaly detection and time performance.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Fault-Tolerant Control (FTC) is a crucial field within control systems engineering that focuses on designing systems capable of maintaining desired performance and stability even in the presence of faults. This study introduces a data-driven fault-tolerant control system that enhances the operation of control systems in the presence of faults. The system is designed on a single Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which replaces the units responsible for diagnosis and control reconfiguration. The LSTM-FTC system does not require diagnostic and process models, which is a significant advantage over traditional model-based methods. The factory I/O is interfaced with MATLAB through the implementation of the digital twin idea, which allows for the simulation and validation of the suggested approaches. These approaches are then applied to an assembler case study that included both faultless and multiple faulty sensors. The training process reaches 6553 iterations with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) equal to at six minutes and 17 s. The results of the simulation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The accuracy of the system outputs in the faultless and worst-case scenarios are 92.81% and 67.16% respectively. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Since the turn of the millennium, computational modelling of biological systems has evolved remarkably and sees matured use spanning basic and clinical research. While the topic of the peri-millennial debate about the virtues and limitations of 'reductionism and integrationism' seems less controversial today, a new apparent dichotomy dominates discussions: mechanistic versus data-driven modelling. In light of this distinction, we provide an overview of recent achievements and new challenges with a focus on the cardiovascular system. Attention has shifted from generating a universal model of the human to either models of individual humans (digital twins) or entire cohorts of models representative of clinical populations to enable in silico clinical trials. Disease-specific parametrization, inter-individual and intra-individual variability, uncertainty quantification as well as interoperable, standardized and quality-controlled data are important issues today, which call for open tools, data and metadata standards, as well as strong community interactions. The quantitative, biophysical and highly controlled approach provided by in silico methods has become an integral part of physiological and medical research. In silico methods have the potential to accelerate future progress also in the fields of integrated multi-physics modelling, multi-scale models, virtual cohort studies and machine learning beyond what is feasible today. In fact, mechanistic and data-driven modelling can complement each other synergistically and fuel tomorrow's artificial intelligence applications to further our understanding of physiology and disease mechanisms, to generate new hypotheses and assess their plausibility, and thus to contribute to the evolution of preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

AB  - The design of industrial installations using digital design techniques (digital twin), aligned with the concept of Industry 4.0, provides a tool to optimize maintenance costs, process gas emissions, energy consumption and to reduce the risks associated with production testing. Modern manufacturing plants conduct chemical processes by combining production experience with model-based research. Analyzing processes using advanced digital techniques can replace traditional methods of technological process balancing. The methodology based on the digital twin already serves as a holistic system of process connections, supporting production, research and development, production planning, and quality control. This paper presents the digital design, optimization, and comparison of process data obtained through simulations for two different types of ammonia recovery units in soda ash production using the ammonia–soda process. Using specialized modeling software and relying on historical data, engineering assumptions, and new concepts, virtual models were created in which the material and thermal balances of the process were simulated. This research is divided into two stages. In the first stage, a model-based approach and model optimization techniques are presented, while in the second stage, the preparation of models of the distillation installation is presented, and the influence of various structural parameters of the equipment on the temperature profile and gas flow rate in the ammonia recovery section is discussed. The process of the research method, based on simulations in a virtual environment, allows for evaluating the implementation potential of the proposed concepts, optimizing process parameters, and redefining the approach to conducting chemical processes. A series of simulations conducted in studies on ammonia recovery indicated a potential increase in gaseous ammonia recovery by up to 14.09%, taking into account the type of distillation apparatus or the height of the packing section. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - In industrial production, in-creasing energy efficiency and the associated reduction in CO₂ emissions are key challenges in times of climate change. Optimized energy use is essential, especially in energy-intensive sectors. The article examines strategies for sustainable energy use such as the modeling and simulation of energy consumption to reduce peak loads and the dynamic adaptation of production phases using machine learning. It also describes approaches to order planning and distribution that are optimized using deep reinforcement learning in order to adapt processes to renewable energies. Digital twins and detailed energy monitoring help to identify and correct inefficiencies at an early stage. The results show that modern technologies can increase energy efficiency and contribute to climate neutrality. © 2025 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston, Germany.

AB  - Advanced planning and scheduling (APS) addresses the complex and uncertain nature of production control. A digital twin (DT), which incorporates simulations through cyber-physical integration, provides an advanced functionality for APS. To facilitate efficient design and implementation, a DT-based APS must satisfy three requirements: technical functionalities for resilience, robust models for diverse operational constraints, and efficient interoperability through cyber-physical integration. Although several studies have proposed the use of DT as a primary technology for APS, proposals that address the process, functionality, integration, and information models are lacking. Additionally, the existing asset descriptions cannot adequately capture the sophisticated characteristics of DT and necessary informational elements for APS. Thus, this study designed a process model, functionalities, and integration models for the DT-based APS and asset descriptions for snapshot synchronization. Crucial service-compositions and functionalities were defined using work-center-level lifecycles. Consequently, a process model was developed, which focused on core activities for resilience. Moreover, horizontal integration between DT and control functionalities and vertical integration between DT and standards, were proposed to enhance the DT-based APS. The proposed method effectively managed the product, process, plan, plant, and resource classes by ensuring adherence to asset administration shell principles. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, two work centers with distinctly different characteristics were employed and demonstrated dominant preventive measures compared to static functionality-based methods. The primary contributions encompass the facilitation of integration and interoperability within a DT-based APS. The proposed methods support the advanced characteristics of DT, ensuring robustness and neutrality across heterogeneous operational contexts. © 2024 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers

AB  - Mammalian cell cultures make a significant contribution to the pharmaceutical industry. They produce many of the biopharmaceuticals obtaining FDA-approval each year. Motivated by quality-by-design principles, various modelling methodologies are frequently trialled to gain insight into these bioprocesses. However, these systems are highly complex and uncertain, involving dynamics at different scales, both in time and space, making them challenging to model in a comprehensive and fully mechanistic manner. This study develops a machine-learning-supported multiscale modelling framework of cell cultures, linking the macroscale bioprocess dynamics to the microscale metabolic flux distribution. As a relevant biopharmaceutical case study, we consider the production of Trastuzumab by Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells in batch. A macroscale hybrid model is constructed by integrating macro-kinetic and machine-learning approaches. Enzyme-constrained Dynamic Metabolic Flux Analysis (ecDMFA) is adopted to calculate flux distributions based on the dynamic predictions of the hybrid model. Uncertainty estimation of the multiscale model is conducted through bootstrapping. Judging from experimental data, our hybrid model can reduce the modelling error of the macroscale dynamics to 8.0%; a 70% reduction from the purely mechanistic model. In addition, the predicted dynamic flux distribution aligns with observations seen in literature, highlighting important metabolic changes throughout the process. Model uncertainty is maintained at a low level, demonstrating the trustworthiness of the predictions. Overall, our comprehensive modelling framework has the potential to facilitate the development of digital twins in the biopharmaceutical industry. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Evaluating early design concepts is crucial as it impacts quality and cost. This process is often hindered by vague and uncertain design information. This article introduces the SysML-based Simulated–Physical Systems Modelling Language (SPSysML). It is a Domain-Specification Language for evaluating component reusability in Cyber–Physical Systems incorporating Digital Twins and other simulated parts. The proposed factors assess the design quantitatively. SPSysML uses a requirement-based system structuring method to couple simulated and physical parts with requirements. SPSysML-based systems incorporate DTs that perceive exogenous actions in the simulated world. SPSysML validation is survey- and application-based. First, we develop a robotic system for an assisted living project. We propose an SPSysML application procedure called SPSysAP that manages the considered system development by evaluating the system designs with the proposed quantitative factors. As a result of the SPSysML application, we observed an integrity improvement between the simulated and physical parts of the system. Thus, more system components are shared between the simulated and physical setups. The system was deployed on the physical robot and two simulators based on ROS and ROS2. Additionally, we share a questionnaire for SPSysML assessment. The feedback that we already received is published in this article. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - The booming development of emerging technologies and their integration in process planning provide new opportunities for solving the problems in traditional trial-and-error process planning. Combining digital twin with 3D computer vision, this paper defines a novel feature-level digital twin process model (FL-DTPM) by extracting machining features from model-based definition models. Firstly, a multi-dimensional FL-DTPM framework is defined by fusing on-site data, quality information, and process knowledge, where the synergistic mechanism of its virtual and physical processes is revealed. Then, 3D computer vision-enabled machining features extraction method is embedded into the FL-DTPM framework to support the reuse of process knowledge, which involves the procedures of data pre-processing, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed features extraction method is verified and the application of FL-DTPM in machining process is presented. Oriented to the impeller process planning, a prototype of FL-DTPM is constructed to explore the potential application scenarios of the proposed method in intelligent process planning, which could provide insights into the industrial implementation of FL-DTPM for aerospace manufacturing enterprises. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - This study delves into enhancing the digital transformation of the discrete manufacturing sector through cutting-edge information technology, specifically digital twin technology. It tackles issues such as the absence of real-time data refreshes and a neglect of individual production units, which hinder the effective monitoring and fault detection of equipment, as well as decision-making delays, reduced production efficiency and other problems. By employing NX MCD simulation, this study introduces a comprehensive digital twin model for production line equipment units, covering aspects like 3D visualization (property model), operational logic (logic model), seamless virtual-physical integration for real-time updates (communication model: The model connects the channel between virtual and physical space, solves the problem of lack of real-time data update), and enabling dynamic production line simulations (simulation model). This innovative framework fosters a direct, real-time link between designers and the digital environment, facilitating ongoing monitoring, preemptive fault detection, and constant optimization of production processes. The efficacy of this approach is underscored by a case study on a pivotal production station, showcasing successful real-time equipment surveillance and validating the practicality of this digital twin strategy. © The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - The Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP) programme is an ambitious but challenging endeavour to design and deliver a prototype fusion power plant. It is a rapid, fast-moving programme, designing a first of a kind device in a Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous (VUCA) environment, and digital tools play a pivotal role in managing and navigating this space. Digital helps manage the complexity and sheer volume of information. Advanced modelling and simulation techniques provide a platform for designers to explore various scenarios and iteratively refine designs, providing insights into the intricate interplay of requirements, constraints and design factors across physics, technology and engineering domains and aiding informed decision-making amidst uncertainties. It also provides a means of building confidence in the new scientific, technological and engineering solutions, given that a full-scale-integrated precursor test is not feasible, almost by definition. The digital strategy for STEP is built around a vision of a digital twin of the whole plant. This will evolve from the current digital shadow formed by system architecting codes and complex workflows and will be underpinned by developing capabilities in plasma, materials and engineering simulation, data management, advanced control, industrial cybersecurity, regulation, digital technologies and related digital disciplines. These capabilities will help address the key challenges of managing the complexity and quantity of information, improving the reliability and robustness of the current digital shadow and developing an understanding of its validity and performance.

AB  - Oil temperature is an important index to reflect the state of transformer and predict the fault and remaining useful life of transformer. However, the oil temperature of the transformer is affected by various factors, such as weather conditions, load changes, holidays, seasons, and so on. In order to predict oil temperature more accurately, this study proposes a VCEEMDAN data decomposition algorithm to extract the characteristics of oil temperature data. And we proposed a hybrid long-term series forecasting model of oil temperature based on VCEEMDAN, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Informer. At the same time, the digital twins system of the manipulator is configured to assist personnel in maintenance when the oil temperature is abnormal. And the digital twins system of an oil-immersed power transformer to monitoring of transformer status. Finally, the above research is integrated into a digital twins system, including transformer condition monitoring, oil temperature prediction, and intelligent maintenance based on Internet of Things (IOT). The proposed prediction method was compared with the six existing models on three datasets. From the experimental results, the best index improvement is 77.97% higher than the second-best model. And the simulation system can provide a good reference for the practical application of the factory. This article presents a hybrid framework that achieves a accurate transformer oil temperature prediction. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The emergence of new technologies of 5G/6G networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) drives the transition from traditional Cloud Computing systems to the Edge Cloud Continuum — an interconnected distributed computing environment. Deploying modern applications in such a complex setting poses significant challenges for efficient dynamic resource management. Besides their several benefits, current orchestration platforms disregard aspects such as the dynamic behavior of applications’ demands, heterogeneity of the infrastructure's resources, and the overall complexity when dealing with interdependent resource allocation decision parameters. The Digital Twin concept envisions assisting application deployments not only by providing offline simulations for experimental assessment in multi-cluster settings but also by actively guiding the orchestration process. In this paper, we aim to provide a modeling and simulation framework to optimize the performance of the underlying infrastructure in terms of resilience and sustainability. We investigate the application of automata theory to model such systems by analyzing their possible states, specifically, using Petri Nets, a mathematical framework for representing discrete event systems, as the primary modeling tool. Therefore, a comprehensive modeling approach is presented to simulate the resource scheduling decisions of an established multi-cluster framework, namely Karmada. Moreover, through this Petri Net modeling approach, we can efficiently optimize the performance of the orchestration process considering the power consumption and workload load balancing of a multi-cluster topology. Extensive evaluation indicates the efficacy of the proposed framework in accurately approximating Karmada's behavior for various scheduling policies. Also, the proposed framework is capable of assessing the performance of several scheduling policies and guiding the system towards efficient resource management in complex scenarios, exploiting the polynomial complexity of the Petri Net to identify scheduling states. © 2025

AB  - Simulation methods for composites manufacturing processes have existed for many years and more recently, with the acceleration of digital technologies, there is increased interest in them. However, industrial uptake and the routine use of these models in the design and manufacture of composite parts has not yet occurred at the same scale as simulation of mechanical performance. This Viewpoint/Perspective article presents and discusses the current state-of-the-art in composites manufacturing simulation and the barriers to their wider adoption, such as large material and process variabilities and the lack of fast numerical models. We also share some personal thoughts on future research directions and how recent academic developments in the field, aiming at increasing model efficiency, leveraging new more efficient hardware (e.g. GPUs) and recent developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence could allow process simulation to become one of the cornerstones of a Composites 4.0 strategy. At the end, the reader should be more familiar with the current state of the art in composites process simulations and have gained an understanding of avenues for progress, in particular their use within a composites 4.0 framework. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Thin-walled machining features are extensively utilized in the aerospace industry, where the milling deformation caused by their weak rigidity has been the most common quality concern. Efficient control of milling deformation for thin-walled features is essential for enhancing quality. However, the high cost and time-consuming nature of data collection for aviation parts, leading to a limited availability of process data, which presents a significant challenge for predicting deformation in aerospace components. To address this issue, this study aims to develop a high-precision milling deformation prediction method by fully leveraging the small-sample data from machining experiments and simulation data. This paper first constructs a thin-walled features deformation prediction framework by integrating Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) with a digital twin process model. Secondly, the DANN method is adopted to achieve online prediction of milling deformation for thin-walled features. A small quantity of experimental deformation data serves as the target domain for training dataset, whereas milling simulation data produced by finite element software serves as the source domain. Milling deformation is accurately predicted using adversarial training based on the DANN structure for domain regression and domain classification. The best results show that the proposed method achieves better goodness of fit under limited sample conditions, with a 5 % increase in the Coefficient of Determination (R²) and a 15 % reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to five baseline methods. In the end, the DANN approach was integrated into the digital twin system for the milling process, and a prototype system was constructed to demonstrate the viability of the suggested approach. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents a study on the ring formation phenomenon in lime kilns using simulation. The research focuses on the chemical recovery cycle integrated into the pulp production process at a pulp mill, with particular emphasis on the calcium cycle within the lime kilns. Lime kilns are critical components, as their unavailability can significantly impact the overall cost-effectiveness of the facility. The calcination of lime sludge occurs in a rotary kiln, where calcium carbonate in the lime sludge is converted into calcium oxide (lime). Under certain conditions, material can progressively accumulate, leading to ring formation and eventual kiln clogging, resulting in operational downtime. To investigate this issue, the authors developed a physics-based model using a finite-dimensional, one-dimensional approach that considers only longitudinal variation. Several approximations were made to maintain a reasonable simulation time without compromising accuracy. Simulations based on real operational data identified fluctuations in fuel flow rate and sulfur content from non-condensable gases as key contributors to ring formation. The results showed that these fluctuations caused instability in the temperature profiles of the solids and gas beds, leading to periods of cooling before the lime sludge reaches the outlet to the coolers. This cooling promotes the recarbonation of lime and, consequently, the formation of rings. The findings highlight that stabilizing fuel flow and managing sulfur content could mitigate ring formation and improve kiln efficiency. The developed model provides a valuable tool for predictive analysis and process optimization, potentially supporting the development of a digital twin to enhance real-time monitoring and operational control. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Accurate and efficient modeling and simulation of spacecraft electrical systems are crucial because of their complexity. However, existing models often struggle to balance simulation efficiency and accuracy. This paper introduces a model reduction method based on singular perturbation theory to simplify the full-order model of spacecraft electrical systems. The experimental results show that the reduced-order simplified model saves 50% of the simulation time with almost no degradation in the simulation accuracy and can be applied to real-world scenarios, such as digital twins. This method offers a new approach for rapid simulation of spacecraft electrical systems and has broad application prospects. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Decentralized periodic event-triggered control can reduce the working time and data transmissions in the sensor nodes for feedback control loops, making it suitable for wireless networked control systems, especially those with large physical scales, such as smart water distribution systems. However, the design of this control approach requires accurate system model, which is normally difficult to obtain. In this work, we assume a digital twin of the original system can be obtained by some modeling and simulation tools, for example, Simscape in MATLAB/Simulink for water distribution systems, and thus present an event-triggered controller design approach. We first present the design of such an event-triggered controller for the digital twin; and then analyze the condition under which if both the original system and its digital twin can be satisfied, the same controller can work for the original system and some type of stability can be guaranteed at the same time. The proposed approach is applied in a smart water distribution system to show the feasibility. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - To effectively assess the credibility of equipment digital twins (DT) for manufacturing, a new method fully considering the dynamic evolution process is urgently needed. In this paper, the influence of the evolution process on the applications is scrutinized, the connotation of equipment DT credibility assessment is expanded, and an assessment method to evaluate the general evolution process of equipment DTs in manufacturing is proposed. The method obtains the application-time-window (ATW) by fitting a joint probability distribution based on observation of actual application time points. Then the method uses the probability of application occurrence as a weight to quantitatively assess the model performance throughout the evolution process. The effectiveness of the method was validated by ablation experiments in manufacturing simulation scenes of workpieces transferring with robotic arms. Compared with existing assessment methods, the error of quantified DT credibility value is reduced by at least 65% and the assessment result can be obtained once the evolution is completed. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Offshore cranes equipped with active motion compensation (AMC) systems play a vital role in marine engineering tasks such as offshore wind turbine maintenance, subsea operations, and dynamic load positioning under wave-induced disturbances. These systems rely on complex hydraulic actuators whose strongly nonlinear dynamics—often described by differential-algebraic equations (DAEs)—impose significant computational burdens, particularly in real-time applications like hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation, digital twins, and model predictive control. To address this bottleneck, we propose a neural network-based surrogate model that approximates the actuator dynamics with high accuracy and low computational cost. By approximately reducing the original DAE model, we obtain a lower-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs) representation, which serves as the foundation for training. The surrogate model includes three hidden layers, demonstrating strong fitting capabilities for the highly nonlinear characteristics of hydraulic systems. Bayesian regularization is adopted to train the surrogate model, effectively preventing overfitting. Simulation experiments verify that the surrogate model reduces the solving time by 95.33%, and the absolute pressure errors for chambers (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) are controlled within 0.1001 MPa and 0.0093 MPa, respectively. This efficient and scalable surrogate modeling framework possesses significant potential for integrating high-fidelity hydraulic actuator models into real-time digital and control systems for offshore applications. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Compared to traditional monitoring methods, multi-sensor fusion smart tool offers several advantages, including full-process monitoring and a broader range of applications (e.g., flat, curved, and complex surfaces). When integrated with artificial intelligence models for tool state monitoring, these tools provide strong generalization capabilities and high prediction accuracy. They can also adjust machine tool process parameters to extend tool life. However, the quasi-in-situ regulation of cutting parameters has a limited scope, making it challenging to achieve full working condition adaptability. The introduction of assisted equipment can enhance process adaptability. Furthermore, adaptive control mechanisms can regulate the machining process to reduce energy consumption by adjusting the opening and closing parameters. Despite these advantages, the linkage control mechanism for the smart tool remains unclear, and existing tool wear models struggle to adapt to variable working conditions across multiple scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper explores the digital twin modeling and application of smart tool machining processes. First, a digital twin-driven tool machining process model is developed, with an exploration of specific application scenarios and methods. Secondly, an adaptive coupling mechanism for assisted equipment based on digital twins is established, which simultaneously improves machining quality and reduces energy consumption. Additionally, the online tool wear identification model is enhanced to increase its generalization and reduce the cost of model reconstruction when working conditions change, thus enabling green intelligent manufacturing under high-quality machining conditions. © 2025 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers

AB  - As the application of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) expands beyond conventional electric vehicles (EVs) to heavy vehicles such as electric trucks or trams, the importance of thermal management in LIB systems is increasing, even at the module or pack level. In particular, because monitoring the thermal behaviors of each cell is not feasible, thermo-electrochemical modeling and simulations in the module or pack level are essential for analyzing and ensuring thermal stability. However, because the conventional lumped thermo-electrochemical models cannot reflect the actual structure of LIB cells, there might be considerable differences may exist between simulation and experimental results. To fill these gaps, we have newly developed a 3D microstructure-based digital twin model of a battery module (8.8 Ah/18.5 V, five LIB pouch cells in series) for an unmanned railway vehicle. Unlike traditional lumped models, our digital twin model accurately well reflects the internal structure of cells and can calculate the heat generation of each component inside a cell. As a result, contrary to a lumped model, the digital twin model can not only simulate the inhomogeneous temperature gradient inside a cell, but also estimates higher local maximum temperatures (TDT, max/TL, max = 137.2 °C/123.9 °C @ 10C discharge) in cells which can trigger thermal runaway. Therefore, microstructure-based digital twin modeling can alleviate concerns regarding the thermal runaway of LIB cells, modules, and packs, and provide safe operating conditions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Shorter product life cycles and the growing demand for mass customization have led to the development of complex production systems, which are crucial for maintaining competitiveness. In this context, digital technologies and simulation tools play a fundamental role in integrating virtual and physical systems to enhance operational performance. This study presents a prototype for self-programming manufacturing systems, achieved through the integration of computer simulation and production management tools, leveraging the Digital Twin (DT) concept. To validate this approach, a prototype capable of interacting with a simulation model was developed. In the event of a failure that compromises product delivery conditions, the simulation model is activated to reprogram the production system’s operating parameters, ensuring compliance with initial production requirements and minimizing the impact of disruptions. The tests confirmed effective data exchange between the physical and virtual environments. Additionally, intentional failures were introduced in the real environment to assess system behavior. Each time a failure occurred, the simulation model generated new operating parameters, adjusting the working speed in the real environment and thereby maintaining the production system’s ability to meet its requirements.

AB  - Digital Twins (DTs) can be constructed for many different applications, leading to substantial differences between different case studies. To be able to learn from the challenges and lessons learned by other DT practitioners, it is important that experience reports be consistent to facilitate comparisons. In this paper, we merge three reference description frameworks for DTs, one generated from a systematic mapping study, one generated from an analysis of experience reports, and one from a systematic literature review, to come up with a unified characterization of DT applications. This analysis has identified six non-overlapping and three cross-cutting characteristics in the reference frameworks. This paper showcases the unified characterization with 21 characteristics to report on a DT case study called the Flex-cell, a manufacturing cell with two robotic arms used for cooperative assembly. The generalizability of this unified characterization is validated using a multi-case approach with another case study in robotics and another in the food industry. We call on the DT community to integrate these systematic reporting principles in their future DT experience reports such that other practitioners can learn from each other more effectively. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Hybrid modeling techniques are increasingly important for improving predictive accuracy and control in biomanufacturing, particularly in data-limited conditions. This study develops and experimentally validates a hybrid deep learning model predictive control (MPC) framework for recombinant P. pastoris fed-batch fermentations. Bayesian optimization and grid search techniques were employed to identify the best-performing hybrid model architecture: an LSTM layer with 2 hidden units followed by a fully connected layer with 8 nodes and ReLU activation. This design balanced accuracy (NRMSE 4.93%) and computational efficiency (AICc 998). This architecture was adapted to a new, smaller dataset of bacteriophage Qβ coat protein production using transfer learning, yielding strong predictive performance with low validation (3.53%) and test (5.61%) losses. Finally, the hybrid model was integrated into a novel MPC system and experimentally validated, demonstrating robust real-time substrate feed control in a way that allows it to maintain specific target growth rates. The system achieved predictive accuracies of 6.51% for biomass and 14.65% for product estimation, with an average tracking error of 10.64%. In summary, this work establishes a robust, adaptable, and efficient hybrid modeling framework for MPC in P. pastoris bioprocesses. By integrating automated architecture searching, transfer learning, and MPC, the approach offers a practical and generalizable solution for real-time control and supports scalable digital twin deployment in industrial biotechnology. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Aiming at the challenge of creating digital twin models within highly flexible systems, a methodology for designing a flexible discrete event system modeling and simulation platform was proposed. The methodology initiated with a thorough analysis of requirements and proceeds to construct a logical model for platform design. Based on this logical model, a comprehensive platform design approach encompassing three critical aspects: simulation engine, flexible twin model modeling and visualization was presented. To facilitate seamless integration between the platform and digital twin models, a data interaction mechanism built upon the event advancement principles of physical entity states and the optimization-oriented algorithm-driven step-by-step iteration process was introduced. To validate the effectiveness of the approach, a prototype platform named NextING was developed and conducted comparative testing with commercial simulation software Plant Simulation. The efficiency of the proposed methodology was demonstrated through case studies involving an assembly production line and a robotic mobile fulfillment system. © 2024 CIMS. All rights reserved.

AB  - With the rapid development of advanced enabling technologies such as cloud computing, large language models, big data, and digital twin (DT), smart assembly has emerged as a central focus within smart manufacturing research. Robots, serving as indispensable execution units in this domain, have traditionally been implemented in serial or rigid parallel configurations. However, these robots typically encounter challenges such as limited load capacity, insufficient rigidity, and complex singularities. Although DT technology has been increasingly applied to robot modeling and simulation, current research falls short in addressing coordinating dynamic assembly processes and ensuring digital-physical synchronization. This gap fails to fully meet the demands of complex assembly tasks. To address these challenges, this study investigates cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs) with a large workspace, high load capacity, and strong dynamic performance. A DT-based smart assembly application framework for CDPRs is proposed, and four key technologies are explored in depth: (1) cable-driven parallel robots assembly process digital twin (CAPDT) model construction; (2) task-level assembly planning; (3) adaptive assembly instruction generation; and (4) CAPDT model consistency retention. These technologies collectively support assembly task planning, simulation verification, performance control, and process management. Finally, a simplified satellite assembly task is presented as a case study, and a DT-based CDPR assembly prototype system for is developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed application framework and technologies. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Calendering is an essential fabrication step for lithium-ion battery electrodes, aimed at achieving the target density through mechanical compression. During this process, the electrode's microstructure significantly deforms, affecting its electrochemical performance. Therefore, it is important to understand how the microstructure evolves during calendering and correlate these changes with electrochemical behavior. Despite tremendous experimental efforts, there are limitations in obtaining sufficient outcomes. In this regard, simulations offer valuable information; however, the highest priority is to develop a reliable modeling framework that reflects actual microstructural changes and establish a robust validating methodology. Without such a framework, computational predictions may not align with experimental results. This study develops a virtual calendering framework based on high-resolution FIB-SEM tomography images of a bimodal LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode with a mass loading of 19.8 mg cm−2 and 96 wt.% active material. The framework is rigorously validated through systematically designed experiments across various electrode densities (2.3–4.0 g cm−3) and further analysis of hidden microstructural features, such as ionic tortuosity, contact area, and crack structure through additional tomography analysis. The virtual calendering framework successfully predicts microstructural changes and electrochemical performance, offering a reliable pathway for identifying optimal design parameters in a time- and cost-effective manner. © 2025 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - With the development of lithium-ion batteries and fuel cells, the application of hybrid power systems is becoming more and more widespread. To better optimize the energy management problem of fuel cell hybrid systems, the accuracy of system modeling and simulation is very important. The hybrid system is formed by connecting the battery to the fuel cell through an active topology. Digital twin technology is applicable to the mapping of physical entities to each other with high interactivity and fast optimization iterations. In this paper, a relevant model based on mathematical logic is established by collecting actual operational data; subsequently, the accuracy of the model is verified by combining relevant operating conditions and simulating the model. Subsequently, a three-dimensional visualization model of a hybrid power system-based sightseeing vehicle and its operating environment was established using digital twin technology to improve the model simulation of the fuel cell hybrid power system. At low speeds, the simulation results of the hybrid power system-based sightseeing vehicle have a small error compared with the actual running state, and the accuracy of the data related to each internal subcomponent is high. In the simple interaction between the model display vehicle and the environment, the communication state can meet the basic requirements of the digital twin model because the amount of data to be transferred is small. This study makes a preliminary attempt at digital parallelism by combining mathematical logic with visualization models and can be used as a basis for the subsequent development of more mature digital twin models. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The cow digital shadow reflects the behavior, health condition, and productivity of cows, playing a crucial role in ensuring animal welfare, increasing individual productivity, and improving breeding efficiency. To fully utilize the existing multimodal data on farms and build a cow digital shadow with rich behavioral information, this study proposes a multimodal data fusion algorithm for recognizing cow behaviors such as drinking, feeding, lying, standing, and walking. This algorithm leverages the strengths of different data modalities, complementing each other, and enhances the performance of the cow behavior classification model. The algorithm integrates motion sensor and video data, collected by custom-made collars with inertial measurement units (IMUs) sensors placed at the top of the cow's neck and cameras in the barn, using EfficientNet V2 S, BiLSTM, and Transformer networks. Experimental results demonstrate recognition accuracies of 98.80 %, precision of 97.15 %, and recall rates of 96.93 %, showing significant improvements over single-modal data behavior recognition algorithms. This method maximizes the utility of existing multimodal data to generate a cow digital shadow with detailed behavioral information, enhancing the modeling and simulation element of the cow digital twin architecture and laying the foundation for developing a comprehensive cow behavior data model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - [Significance] As a fundamental unit for representing complex processes in the real world, events have garnered increasing attention across disciplines in recent years. With the advancement of major initiatives such as Digital Twin and China's 3D realistic geospatial scene, there is an urgent need to reexamine event definitions, classification schemes, and data modeling systems from an entity-based perspective to support multidimensional information representation and deep semantic interpretation. [Progress] This paper first provides a systematic review of the conceptual connotations and definitional characteristics of events from a cross-disciplinary perspective. It then summarizes the theoretical foundations and structural features of existing event classification approaches. Furthermore, based on modeling principles and application scopes, a tripartite framework for event data models is proposed, comprising: (1) semantic element-based models, (2) ontology-based event models, and (3) spatiotemporal entity-oriented event models. These models are systematically analyzed and comparatively evaluated in terms of their expressiveness across key dimensions such as time, space, participating objects, event relationships, and hierarchical structures, revealing their respective advantages and limitations in supporting dynamic process modeling, generality, and extensibility. [Methods] Building on the above, a spatiotemporal entity-based definition of events is proposed, followed by two novel classification approaches for entity-oriented event modeling and analysis: one based on the completeness of event records, and the other on the types of involved change processes. [Prospect] Future research should advance event data models from structural organization toward semantic integration and intelligent construction. This entails integrating the strengths of diverse models to build a unified framework; fostering synergy between qualitative and quantitative modeling mechanisms for integrated analysis; and incorporating artificial intelligence to enhance model intelligence and adaptability. © 2025 Science Press.

AB  - Due to the increasing complexity of customer demands for different batches and types of products, manufacturing operations management has been facing the challenge of uncertain product arrival times and resource processing times in customized manufacturing (CM). This paper proposes a dynamic scheduling method to solve the uncertainty in CM via the integration of the digital twin and fuzzy reinforcement learning methods. In this study, a digital twin-driven framework is first designed to describe the operation management system (OMS) hierarchies. Then a semi-Markov decision process (MDP) model with fuzzy definition is built by abstracting the stochastic scheduling process. To solve the semi-MDP model, an asynchronous multi-edge co-training method is presented to train a fuzzy deep neural network through closed-loop control of virtual commissioning, illustrating how the digital twin-driven OMS adapts to dynamic production requirements. Finally, the proposed method is verified by the performance of comparative experiment. Experimental results show that for randomly arriving products, the proposed method guarantees timely training and scheduling decisions and has the highest total system profit compared to other competing methods (Hybrid Multi-Agent System Negotiation and Ant Colony Optimization (HMA), Onto_MDP, and Deep Q Networks (DQN)). Also, the proposed method shows better scheduling performance in terms of average decision time, average training time and number of finished products when resources are abnormal. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fit-out construction is crucial for the functionality of completed infrastructures. However, the absence of a robust data collection system hinders efficient project management, causing delays and extra costs. This paper introduces a digital twin-enabled platform that utilizes Internet of Things (IoT) and neural network technologies for real-time visibility and traceability of prefabricated materials. The effectiveness of the proposed platform has been validated through a real-life prefabricated construction project in Hong Kong. Leveraging the IoT-captured data, visual and event-driven process models are developed to simulate materials flow and workflow executions. Hierarchical finite state machines (HFSM) facilitate the management of prefabricated construction supply chain. Results show the platform's effectiveness in identifying abnormal event states and notifying stakeholders in real-time, thus supporting advanced project management practices. This platform improves information coordination among stakeholders, providing real-time visibility and traceability, and enabling hierarchical management at strategic, tactical, and operational levels throughout the prefabrication process. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Digital twins (DTs) consist of various technologies and therefore require a wide range of data. However, many businesses often face challenges in providing sufficient data due to technical limitations or business constraints. This can result in inadequate data for training or calibrating the models used within a digital twin. This paper aims to explore how knowledge can be generated from federated digital twins—an approach that lies between digital twin networks and collaborative manufacturing—and how this can be used to enhance understanding for both AI systems and humans. Inspired by the concept of federated machine learning, where data and algorithms are shared across different stakeholders, this idea involves different companies collaborating through their respective DTs, a situation which can be referred to as federated twinning. As a result, the models within these DTs can be enriched with more-detailed information, leading to the creation of verified, high-fidelity models. Human involvement is also emphasized, particularly in the transfer of knowledge. This can be applied to the modeling process itself, which is the primary focus here, or to any control design aspect. Specifically, the paradigm of thermal process modeling is used to illustrate how federated digital twins can help refine underlying models. Two sequential cases are considered: the first one is used to study the type of knowledge that is required from modeling and federation; while the second one investigates the creation of a more suitable form of modeling. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This paper presents a framework for developing a “soft digital twin” (SDT) for reliability optimization through modeling and simulation. The focus is on demonstrating the effectiveness of the SDT in modeling maintenance task processes within mission-critical facilities, which is particularly essential for reliable operations in critical infrastructure such as nuclear facilities. The need for efficient completion of maintenance tasks (MTs) to ensure high reliability and minimal downtime underscores the challenge faced by managers, who desire a predictive tool akin to a “crystal ball” for optimal resource configuration in the face of uncertainties from equipment failures, staffing issues, and supply chain disruptions. The proposed SDT functions as this predictive tool, leveraging the simulation’s versatility to provide insights into resource configurations and staff planning. This work extends the prior research by incorporating additional model validation, sensitivity testing, and analysis of the impact of various resource changes on the system. It employs a combination of data-driven frameworks and stochastic modeling methods to construct an adaptive SDT capable of accommodating changes in system behavior. The work provides a framework for the construction of SDT, testing and validation of its results, and its application to a case study of a mission-critical facility focused on replication and then optimizing of two key performance indicators based on human resource mixtures. Initial findings suggest that the SDT yields reliable results comparable to retrospective test datasets, offering the potential to minimize MTs’ time in the system while maximizing throughput within specified time frames through scenario experimentation and optimization.. © The Author(s) 2024

AB  - In this study, we examined a digital twin model that has multiple processes. Generally, previous processes affect subsequent processes in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Therefore, to construct reusable modular models, the mutual influences between processes should be defined and concisely represented. We built a digital twin model involving the post-annealing and wet etching of an oxide film formed by atomic layer deposition (ALD), as a case study. We developed a modular model that separated processes based on intermediate variables extracted through physical analysis. The high coefficient of determination obtained from the prediction results suggests that these intermediate variables sufficiently captured the effect of the preceding processes. Further, we explored concepts for improving model reusability using class structure analysis within an object-oriented programming (OOP) framework. We observed the need for encapsulating physics-based intermediate variables within appropriate classes to separate process- and device-specific descriptions. The encapsulated intermediate variables indirectly represented process influence and enabled the modularization of class-internal models. These findings help in reducing dependencies between models, thereby contributing to improved model reusability. © 1988-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The Knowledge-Based Digital Twin System is a digital twin system developed on the foundation of a knowledge graph, aimed at serving the complex manufacturing process. This system embraces a knowledge-driven modeling approach, aspiring to construct a digital twin model for the manufacturing process, thereby enabling precise description, management, prediction, and optimization of the process. The core of this system lies in the comprehensive knowledge graph that encapsulates all pertinent information about the manufacturing process, facilitating dynamic modeling and iteration through knowledge matching and inference within the knowledge, geometry, and decision model. This approach not only ensures consistency across models but also addresses the challenge of coupling multi-source heterogeneous information, creating a holistic and precise information model. As the manufacturing process deepens and knowledge accumulates, the model's understanding of the process progressively enhances, promoting self-evolution and continuous optimization. The developed knowledge-decision-geometry model acts as the ontological layer within the digital twin framework, laying a foundational conceptual framework for the digital twin of the manufacturing process. Validated on an aero-engine blade production line in a factory, the results demonstrate that the knowledge model, as the core driver, enables continuous self-updating of the geometric model for an accurate depiction of the entire manufacturing process, while the decision model provides deep insights for decision-makers based on knowledge. The system not only effectively controls, predicts, and optimizes the manufacturing process but also continually evolves as the process advances. This research offers a new perspective on the realization of the digital twin for the manufacturing process, providing solid theoretical support with a knowledge-driven approach. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Featured Application: The outcome of this work can be implemented as an analytics framework within a digital twin environment in the manufacturing sector. The latest research highlights the need for circularity in modern industrial supply chains, which is reflected in the decisions of European and global policymakers, as well as in the strategies of major stakeholders. Digital Twins are considered a principal catalyst in the transition to circularity, while real-world, accurate and timely data is a key factor in these supply chains. This emphasis on data highlights the central role of data analytics in extracting key insights and utilizing machine learning to propose sustainability initiatives in decentralized production ecosystems. In consequence, commercial solutions are being developed; however, a single solution might not address all requirements. In this work we present a comprehensive modular, scalable and secure analytics architecture, designed to expand the available components in commercial solutions by providing an intelligent layer to Digital Twins. Our approach integrates with the latest standards for international data spaces, interoperability and process models in distributed environments where multiple actors engage in co-opetition. The proposed architecture is implemented in a market-ready solution and demonstrated in two case studies, in Spain and in Greece. Validation results confirm that the analytics service delivers accurate, timely and actionable insights, while following open communication standards and sustainability guidelines. Our research indicates that companies implementing digital twin solutions using standardized connectors for interoperability can benefit by customizing the proposed solution and avoiding complex developments from scratch. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - This paper introduces a methodology for information modelling and analysis of physical manufacturing processes for digital twins (DTs). It aims to establish a comprehensive and fundamental understanding of manufacturing processes regarding the specific purpose of the DT. Through this methodology, information entities within the manufacturing process that can be represented in DTs, along with their essential attributes, are systematically identified. To achieve this, an information model is firstly proposed to define such entities, termed as representative information. The attributes and hierarchy of entities are formulated based on a requirements analysis of the DT lifecycle. An Integration Definition for Process Modelling 0 (IDEF0) model, Petri nets, and a literature-based identification process are applied to represent the manufacturing process's workflow and identify information entities. Moreover, the relative importance of representing each information entity in a DT is evaluated by integrating domain-specific knowledge with the specific purpose of the DT. Three types of information analysis are suggested, each with its corresponding methods: empirical analysis, theoretical analysis, and experimental analysis. Specifically, this study explores the material extrusion (MEX) process of the Prusa i3 MK3 printer, resulting in an information model consisting of 128 entities including 21 components, 25 activities and 82 properties. These information entities and associated attributes provide a reference for selecting and synchronizing specific physical information in a DT for estimating dimensional accuracy during the MEX process. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - In healthcare, the use of digital twin (DT) technology has been recognised as essential for enhancing patient care through real-time remote monitoring. However, concerns regarding risk prediction, task offloading, and data security have been raised due to the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in remote healthcare. In this study, a new method was introduced, combines edge computing with sophisticated cybersecurity solutions. A vast amount of environmental and physiological data has been gathered, allowing for thorough understanding of patients. The system included hybrid encryption, threat prediction, Merkle Tree verification, certificate-based authentication, and secure communication. The feasibility of the proposal was evaluated by using an ESP32-Azure IoT Kit and Azure Cloud to evaluate the system's capacity to securely send patient data to healthcare institutions and stakeholders, while simultaneously upholding data confidentiality. The system demonstrated a notable improvement in encryption speed, with 27.18%, represented as the improved efficiency and achieved storage efficiency ratio 0.673. Furthermore, the evidence from the simulations showed that the system's performance was not affected by encryption since encryption times continuously remained within a narrow range. Moreover, proactive alert of probable security risks would be detected from the predictive analytics, hence strong data integrity assurance. The results suggest the proposed system provided a proactive, personalised care approach for cybersecurity-protected DT healthcare (DTH) high-level modelling and simulation, enabled via IoT and cloud computing under improved threat prediction. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - In this paper, a set of mathematical tools are developed and assembled to quantify, predict and virtually assess N2O emission mitigation strategies in partial nitritation (PN) / anammox (ANX) granular based reactors. The proposed approach is constructed upon a set of data pre-treatment methods, process simulation models, control tools (and algorithms) and key performance indicators to analyze, reproduce, and forecast the behavior of multiple operational variables within aerobic granular sludge systems. All these elements are tested on two full-scale data sets (#D1, #D2) collected over a period of four months (Sept-Dec 2023). Results show that data pretreatment is essential for noise reduction, filling data gaps, and ensuring smooth process simulations. The model accurately predicts (normalized RMSE< 1) multiple N oxidation states (NHx, NO2-, NO3-, N2O) and dissolved oxygen (DO), demonstrating its capability to describe bacterial behavior within the studied system. Special emphasis is placed on weak acid-base chemistry where pH is reliably reproduced, and it can be used for control purposes. Both biological and physico-chemical aspects are predicted at different time scales (months, days, minutes). While nitritation mainly occurred in the bulk, biofilm distribution showed inactive inner granule parts and increasing biomass (mostly ANX) towards the surface, with distinct organic concentrations. Gradients for multiple soluble compounds could also be reflected. Nitrifier denitrification (ND) is identified as the main N2O production pathway. The model revealed that the system was suffering from low ANX activity leading to NO2- accumulation. This in combination with low DO levels resulted in an unusually high emission factor (EF). The validation data set also yielded satisfactory results (normalized RMSE< 1). The scenario analysis revealed that modification of the operational parameters could improve the ANX activity and lead to N2O emission rates that are in line with what is normally expected from similar systems. The study includes a discussion on transitioning from process models to digital shadows/ twins for real-time process monitoring. Additionally, it emphasizes the necessity of evaluating reject water technologies from a plant-wide perspective. © 2025 The Author(s)

AB  - Digital twin networks (DTNs) enable largescale modeling and simulation of complex physical systems by interconnecting virtual replicas of physical objects. However, existing DTNs are highly centralized, which inherently limits their performance during digital twin generation and fault tolerance when facing device failures or malicious attacks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel decentralized digital twin network (DeDTN) paradigm based on blockchain and edge computing technologies. DeDTN achieves high scalability by enabling digital twins to be generated through decentralized edge devices contributed by individual device owners. When confronted with failures or attacks, digital twin consistency is maintained through blockchain consensus among participating devices. Additionally, digital twins are tokenized on-chain to secure ownership and enable seamless sharing between stakeholders. To demonstrate DeDTN's effectiveness, we implement a prototype for transportation traffic modeling in smart cities. Evaluation results show that DeDTN significantly outperforms traditional centralized DTNs in terms of latency and bandwidth efficiency. We also outline several open challenges and future research directions for DeDTN and its applications. © 1979-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Background: The article discusses the problem of modeling and simulation of the production process, as well as accompanying intralogistics processes in the automotive industry, which are characterized by advanced production standards and high product quality. The analyzed processes concern a Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) for manufacturing a family of gear wheels and a distribution center that operates in a cross-docking regime. The goal of the research is to create a methodology of modeling and simulation of production and intralogistics processes with the help of a digital twin, which aims to integrate the design of production and logistics systems, considering factors such as manipulation and transportation of each product. Therefore, the article emphasizes the optimization of intralogistics processes. Methods: The proposed methodology is based on the Value Stream Mapping (VSM) method, which is used for identifying critical components of the production system being analyzed. The first step involves creating a VSM of the current state of the production system, which can be utilized to model key research areas, such as current planning, scheduling, manufacturing, and intralogistics. Analyzing the map and related models leads to the development of a future state map, used to create improved models of the system. Subsequently, the models are integrated into a digital twin with the use of the Flexsim program. Results: The results of simulation experiments confirm that the introduction of a FMS with AGV transport allows improvement in the intralogistics system, reduces the production cycle of a planned order package from two days to one day, and improves the distribution process with the use of pallets and short transportation batches, which enables 64 shipments during one shift. The experiments also confirm the stability of the model for different numbers of AGVs and a random inflow of orders. Conclusions: The proposed methodology of creating a digital twin makes it possible to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed improvements and to verify production plans. The advantage of the applied simulations and analyses is the significant reduction in the amount of time spent searching for optimal solutions and storage capacities. © 2024, Poznan School of Logistics.

AB  - Smart manufacturing utilizes digital twins that are virtual forms of their production plants for analyzing and optimizing decisions. Digital twins have been mainly developed as discrete-event models (DEMs) to represent the detailed and stochastic dynamics of productions in the plants. The optimum decision is achieved after simulating the DEM-based digital twins under various what-if decision candidates; thus, simulation acceleration is crucial for rapid optimum determination for given problems. For the acceleration of discrete-event simulations, adaptive abstraction-level conversion approaches have been previously proposed to switch active models of each machine group between a set of DEM components and a corresponding lookup table-based mean-delay model during runtime. The switching is decided by detecting the machine group's convergence into (or divergence from) a steady state. However, there is a tradeoff between speedup and accuracy loss in the adaptive abstraction convertible simulation (AACS), and inaccurate simulation can degrade the quality of the optimum (i.e., the distance between the calculated optimum and the actual optimum). In this article, we propose a simulation-based optimization that optimizes the problem based on a genetic algorithm while tuning specific hyperparameters (related to the tradeoff control) to maximize the speedup of AACS under a specified accuracy constraint. For each individual, the proposed method distributes the overall computing budget for multiple simulation runs (considering the digital twin's probabilistic property) into the hyperparameter optimization (HPO) and fitness evaluation. We propose an efficient HPO method that manages multiple Gaussian process models (as speedup-estimation models) to acquire promising optimal hyperparameter candidates (that maximize the simulation speedups) with few attempts. The method also reduces each individual's exploration overhead (as the population evolves) by estimating each hyperparameter's expected speedup using previous exploration results of neighboring individuals without actual simulation executions. The proposed method was applied to optimize raw-material releases of a large-scale manufacturing system to prove the concept and evaluate the performance under various situations.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - While large enterprises are actively preparing for digital transformation by leveraging technologies such as digital twins, smaller companies face challenges due to economic constraints and market uncertainties, leading to a relative lack of awareness and readiness. To address this situation, this study proposes a digital twin development framework tailored for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This framework utilizes attachable IoT devices for real-time collection of manufacturing data and leverages public server systems for data management. Moreover, it enables the refinement and optimization of digital twins by training machine learning models on collected data. Additionally, the framework includes the integration of simulation models and machine learning models for comprehensive digital twin modelling. Finally, the paper suggests a process for applying and validating this framework in real manufacturing companies, demonstrating the effects of digital twin implementation on productivity enhancement in the production lines of two SMEs.

AB  - Material flow simulation is a core technology of Industry 4.0. It can analyze and improve large-scale production systems through experimentation with digital simulation models. However, modeling in discrete event simulation is considered as an effortful and time-consuming activity and challenges especially small and medium-sized enterprises. Systematic experiments and what-if-analysis require a large number of models. Modeling and simulation becomes a repetitive activity and the ability to model and simulate instantly becomes crucial for industry, 4.0. However, model generation typically uses specific methods to build models with individual properties for specific physical systems. A general literature review cannot sufficiently describe the current state of model generation. This study aims to provide an analysis of model generation based on the modeling strategy, modeling view, and production system type, as well as model properties and limitations. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - While the roll-to-roll manufacturing process plays a key role in high-throughput and cost-effective production, precise web tension control remains a critical challenge due to the dynamic interaction of web materials and roller mechanics. To address these challenges, this study proposes an AI-driven digital twin framework for autonomous web tension control optimization. The proposed method integrates Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process modeling to efficiently explore and adjust proportional and integral control parameters. While the operation of the roll-to-roll system is managed through a real-time client-server communication, system responses are designed to be iteratively refined by the proposed surrogate model. Experimental validation on an actual roll-to-roll manufacturing system demonstrates that the optimized control strategy significantly reduces tension variation and improves system stability. The proposed method highlights the potential of AI-integrated digital twins in autonomous manufacturing, which can offer a scalable solution for a variety of industrial applications. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Digital twins have been gaining an immense interest in various fields over the last decade. Bringing conventional process simulation models into (near) real time are thought to provide valuable insights for operators, decision makers, and stakeholders in many industries. The objective of this paper is to describe two methods for implementing digital twins at water resource recovery facilities and highlight and discuss their differences and preferable use situations, with focus on the automated data transfer from the real process. Case 1 uses a tailor-made infrastructure for automated data transfer between the facility and the digital twin. Case 2 uses edge computing for rapid automated data transfer. The data transfer lag from process to digital twin is low compared to the simulation frequency in both systems. The presented digital twin objectives can be achieved using either of the presented methods. The method of Case 1 is better suited for automatic recalibration of model parameters, although workarounds exist for the method in Case 2. The method of Case 2 is well suited for objectives such as soft sensors due to its integration with the SCADA system and low latency. The objective of the digital twin, and the required latency of the system, should guide the choice of method. Practitioner Points: Various methods can be used for automated data transfer between the physical system and a digital twin. Delays in the data transfer differ depending on implementation method. The digital twin objective determines the required simulation frequency. Implementation method should be chosen based on the required simulation frequency. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The mining industry faces increasing pressure to improve efficiency, reduce operational costs, and adapt to modern technological trends. Central to these challenges is digitalization. This paper compares the level of digitalization in the mining industry internationally and in Slovakia, raising the question of the feasibility of implementing digitalization tools in small-scale Slovak mining operations. The presented case study demonstrates the creation of a simulation model and 3D animation for the development of small and medium-sized open pit mines, using Tecnomatix Plant Simulation software version 2302.0004, empirical data collection, and programming with SimTalk 2.0. Internationally, digitalization through modeling and simulation is already at a much higher level, with advanced solutions such as digital twins. In contrast, digitalization in Slovak mining operations is limited to basic simulation approaches, with only a few documented attempts, highlighting substantial opportunities for further development. The simulation model developed in this study enables more efficient planning and management of logistics and transportation processes, with potential benefits for operational improvements, safety, and sustainability. Adopting digitalization, even in small-scale operations, can drive the future development of the Slovak mining industry. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Physics Informed Machine Learning has emerged as a popular approach for modeling and simulation in digital twins, enabling the generation of accurate models of processes and behaviors in real-world systems. However, existing methods either rely on simple loss regularizations that offer limited physics integration or employ highly specialized architectures that are difficult to generalize across diverse physical systems. This paper presents a generic approach based on a novel physics-encoded residual neural network (PERNN) architecture that seamlessly combines data-driven and physics-based analytical models to overcome these limitations. Our method integrates differentiable physics blocks–implementing mathematical operators from physics-based models–with feed-forward learning blocks, while intermediate residual blocks ensure stable gradient flow during training. Consequently, the model naturally adheres to the underlying physical principles even when prior physics knowledge is incomplete, thereby improving generalizability with low data requirements and reduced model complexity. We investigate our approach in two application domains. The first is a steering model for autonomous vehicles in a simulation environment, and the second is a digital twin for climate modeling using an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based model of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) to enable gap-filling in flux tower data. In both cases, our method outperforms conventional neural network approaches as well as state-of-the-art Physics Informed Machine Learning methods. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Due to Dimension Studios and Unsigned Group, by likeness and movement digitization, the human supermodel Eva Herzigová’s highly realistic metahuman and 3D digital twin lead to perpetual career extension (e.g., on virtual runway shows by catwalk replication or in advertising campaigns by particular pose adoption), including in virtual worlds such as metaverse spaces, by use of extended reality technologies, in terms of virtual clothing, digital hair, skin texture, facial and body expressions, and makeup styling as avatar appearance and persona. In this paper, we show how, by likeness capturing (e.g., signature walk by motion capture shoot for face and body movement tracking) and virtual clothing, Eva Herzigová’s hyperreal 3D avatar (lifelike 3D digital human clone or realistic virtual human) is configured with subsequent restyled hair and make-up, 3D clothing modeling, and extended reality fashion shows on virtual catwalks or campaign shoots. We clarify that photographic reference materials and a sensor-based motion capture suit assisted Metahuman Creator in capturing facial and motion data for Eva Herzigová’s digital avatar, configuring realistic depiction and virtual activations of beauty standards, in addition to digital likeness, signature style, talent representation, and narrations, typifying digital human creation and presence in virtual worlds (e.g., for metaverse-based shoots). We conclude that Eva Herzigová’s hyperrealistic 3D digital human twin and MetaHuman avatar operate as a styled virtual alter ego and versatile personal brand extension by motion capture technologies for immersive virtual fashion shows, live video streams and broadcast, and digital wearable modeling. © 2024 G.

AB  - Due to the increasing number of vehicles and the limited land supply, old residential areas generally face parking difficulties. An intelligent parking service is a critical study direction to address parking difficulty since it can achieve the automatic management of parking processes and planning of parking spaces. However, the existing intelligent parking service systems have shortcomings such as low information quality, low management efficiency, and single service mode. To address the shortcomings, in this paper, we conduct a systematic study on utilizing digital twin (DT) technology to improve the intelligent parking service system. The main contributions are threefold: (1) We analyze the function requirements of the intelligent parking service for old residential areas, such as visual monitoring, refined management, and simulation optimization. (2) We design a DT-based intelligent parking service system by collecting data on physical parking space, constructing the corresponding virtual parking space, and building the user interaction platform. An old residential area in Guangzhou, China is used as a use case to show that the designed parking service system can meet the function requirements. (3) Through mathematical modeling and simulation evaluation, we utilize two typical intelligent parking services including dynamic parking planning and driving safety assessment to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. This study provides innovative solutions for parking management in old residential areas, utilizing DT technology to not only improve information quality and management efficiency, but also provide a theoretical basis and practical reference for the intelligent transformation of urban parking services. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Gas turbine (GT) modeling and optimization have been widely studied at the design level but still lacks focus on real-world operational cases. The concept of a digital twin (DT) allows for the interaction between operation data and the system dynamic performance. Among many DT studies, only a few focus on GT for thermal power plants. This study proposes a digital twin prototype framework including the following modules: process modeling, parameter estimation, and performance optimization. Provided with real-world power plant operational data, key performance parameters such as turbine inlet temperature (TIT) and specific fuel consumption (SFC) were initially unavailable, therefore necessitating further calculation using thermodynamic analysis. These parameters are then used as a target label for developing artificial neural networks (ANNs). Three ANN models with different structures are developed to predict TIT, SFC, and turbine power output (GTPO), achieving high R2 scores of 94.03%, 82.27%, and 97.59%, respectively. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are then employed to estimate the values of the air–fuel ratio and combustion efficiency for each time index. The PINN-based estimation resulted in estimated values that align with the literature. Subsequently, an unconventional method of detecting alarms by using conformal prediction were also proposed, resulting in a significantly reduced number of alarms. The developed ANNs are then combined with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to carry out performance optimization in real time. GTPO and SFC are selected as the primary metrics for the optimization, with controllable parameters such as AFR and a fine-tuned inlet guide vane position. The results demonstrated that GTPO could be optimized with the application of conformal prediction when the true GTPO is detected to be higher than the upper range of GTPO obtained from the ANN model with a conformal prediction of a 95% confidence level. Multiple PSO variants were also compared and benchmarked to ensure an enhanced performance. The proposed PSO in this study has a lower mean loss compared to GEP. Furthermore, PSO has a lower computational cost compared to RS for hyperparameter tuning, as shown in this study. Ultimately, the proposed methods aim to enhance GT operations via a data-driven digital twin concept combination of deep learning and optimization algorithms. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - The spindle determines the performance of machine tools; hence, monitoring its health is essential to maintain machining productivity and avoid costly downtimes. The magnitudes and locations of wear and cracks in the bearing balls and races gradually develop which are difficult to detect. This article presents a physics-based digital model of the spindle with bearing faults, worn contact interface between the shaft and tool holder, and spindle imbalance. The wear of races and balls is considered in the bearing model. The worn taper contact interface and the spindle imbalance are included in the digital model. The spindle’s dynamic model is used to simulate the vibrations at any location in the spindle assembly where sensors can be mounted for online monitoring. The wear type and bearing location are correlated with the frequency spectrum of vibrations at operating speeds. The proposed fault models are used to analyze the critical signal features and experimentally validated by the frequency extracted from a damaged spindle in Part II. The physics-based digital model is used to train data analytic models to detect spindle faults in Part III. © 2024 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). All rights reserved.

AB  - Digital twins have attracted a lot of attention recently. However, the current manifestations are merely digital shadows, lacking means for bidirectional data exchange, which makes their use for assisting the construction of buildings much more difficult. We argue that this is due to the lack of a systematic process for developing a digital twin during a building’s life cycle. We argue to look for a solution by combining agile engineering with IT change management to establish an agile, change-driven process for engineering digital twins. Such a process, of course, deserves a qualitative assessment of the engineering process and the resulting digital twin. In the future, it should be possible to obtain a digital twin from a BIM-based design process by applying IT change management in an agile manner. This should happen under maximum automation and life cycle orientation. Our proposal is motivated by several years of interdisciplinary collaboration between civil engineering and computer science and evaluated using the Technology Acceptance Model. While the TAM is not specifically designed for digital twin methodologies, its application here aims to assess perceived usefulness and ease of use of DT methodologies from the user’s perspective, without addressing scalability concerns. This aims to provide actionable insights to guide the refinement of the process model, aligning it with user requirements and achieving its intended outcomes. Our evaluation confirms the proposed process’s perceived usefulness and ease of use, with robust correlations indicating strong acceptance potential among stakeholders. These results highlight the feasibility of the proposed approach and its alignment with expectations in real-world applications. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - The traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) industry is a crucial part of China′s pharmaceutical sector and plays a strategic role in ensuring public health and promoting economic and social development. In response to the practical demand for high-quality development of the TCM industry, this paper focused on the bottlenecks encountered during the digital and intelligent transformation of TCM production systems. Specifically, it explored technical strategies and methodologies for constructing the best TCM production mode. An innovative artificial intelligence(AI)-centered technical architecture for TCM production was proposed, focusing on key aspects of production management including process modeling, state evaluation, and decision optimization. Furthermore, a series of critical technologies were developed to realize the best TCM production mode. Finally, a novel AI-driven TCM production mode characterized by a closed-loop system of "measurement-modeling-decision-execution" was presented through engineering case studies. This study is expected to provide a technological pathway for developing new quality productive forces within the TCM industry. © 2025 Zhongguo Zhongyi Yanjiuyuan. All rights reserved.

AB  - Construction sites are highly unpredictable environments involving a wide variety of stakeholders with complex information exchanges, which lead to the well-known inefficiencies and unproductivity of the construction sector. The adoption of Building Digital Twins (BDT) in the construction site is a promising solution to this issue, by automating data acquisition and knowledge extraction processes and providing what-if scenario simulation capabilities. Furthermore, the current research sets the principles to define, replicate, and scale-up the architecture of a Building Digital Twin Platform (BDTP), conceived as a scalar ecosystem, which allows to seamlessly manage on-site construction processes, integrating cross-cutting domains for the construction site optimization (Progress monitoring, Quality control, Operational Health and Safety, Equipment control, and Production planning). The starting point of the research is a comprehensive diagnosis of on-site process inefficiencies and the barriers to its digitalization leading to the user requirements, which have been underpinned by questionnaires and interviews addressed within an open innovation user-centered approach around Living Labs. The research has been conceived following the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology and based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) analysis for the continuous improvement of the construction process. By means of the adoption of the standard Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), based on the BDTP architecture, the research has resulted in BPMN workflows stemmed from the Digital Twin (DT) where the DT itself is an actor in a service-oriented data-exchange workflow. Moreover, the use of a BDTP can pave the way for the transition from user-driven construction management to hybrid management, coexisting with both human and digital actors and merging expert knowledge with artificial intelligence techniques. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The digital twin (DT) mainly acts as a virtual exemplification of a real-world entity, system, or process via multiphysical and logical models, allowing the capture and synchronization of its functions and attributes. The bridge between the actual system and the digital realm can be utilized to optimize the system’s performance, and forecast and predict its behavior. Incorporating intelligent and adaptive reasoning mechanisms into DTs is crucial to enable them to reason, adapt, and take efficacious actions in complex and dynamic environments. To this end, we introduce an approach for deploying agent-based DTs for cyber-physical systems. The foundation pillars of this approach are (1) integrating the concepts, entities, and relations of Zeigler’s modeling and simulation framework from the perspective of agent-based DTs; (2) utilizing an expandable and scalable architecture for designing and materializing these twins, which handily enables extending and scaling physical and digital assets of the system; and finally (3) a two-tier reasoning strategy; reactive and rational models are conceptually redefined in the context of the modeling and simulation framework of agent-based DTs and technically deployed to boost the adaptive reasoning and decision-making function of DTs. As a result, an implemented simulation and control platform for a multi-robot system demonstrates the approach’s applicability and feasibility, manifesting its usability and efficiency. The platform represents physical entities as autonomous agents, creates their DTs, and assigns adequate reasoning capability to promote adaptive planning, autonomous resource management, and flexible logical decision-making to handle different situations and scenarios. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Nowadays, smart systems require the use of Digital Twins (DTs) for their engineering and management. Self-updating capability is a key feature in the DT technology. This raises the challenge of model inference from data collected on the system and requires a formal framework be defined, in which a system representation can be coupled with inference methods to achieve automatic model updating. While data-based process model inference is a well-known technique, the inference of a simulation model from existing knowledge and collected data is yet an unexplored area. In this paper, we first clarify and explicitly define some key elements of the terminology related to the DT concept, including model update and model inference, and we propose a framework of inference capabilities based on a formal DT specification, which formally captures the conditions for different updating capabilities and relates them. That way, on one hand, the framework enables the use of symbolic approaches to build a DT with the desired inference capability, and on the other hand, it establishes a partial order relation between inference capabilities. Through a case study, we show how the framework helps formally specifying the DT model of a mobility system toward realizing a fully capable DT. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The proposed paper presents a methodology for mapping electronic manufacturing control processes within a Knowledge Management (KM) framework, aligning with human-centric and transdisciplinary approaches. Specifically, the paper explores a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) process for tuning production machinery, facilitating quality management and predictive maintenance through an AI-driven model. The PID circuit model is designed using the LTspice tool, while the entire production workflow is structured according to the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard. The model incorporates Artificial Intelligence (AI) to optimize machine control, establishing an advanced Digital Twin (DT) model that enables interactive human-system collaboration. The work further describes Knowledge Base (KB) data sources that support KM within Industry 5.0 environments, emphasizing AI-enhanced, user-centered control systems. Finally, the paper discusses new managerial roles and skill sets necessary for overseeing these integrated, human-centric KM systems in next-generation industrial applications. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Autonomous methods to align beamlines can decrease the amount of time spent on diagnostics, and also uncover better global optima leading to better beam quality. The alignment of these beamlines is a high-dimensional expensive-to-sample optimization problem involving the simultaneous treatment of many optical elements with correlated and nonlinear dynamics. Bayesian optimization is a strategy of efficient global optimization that has proved successful in similar regimes in a wide variety of beamline alignment applications, though it has typically been implemented for particular beamlines and optimization tasks. In this paper, we present a basic formulation of Bayesian inference and Gaussian process models as they relate to multi-objective Bayesian optimization, as well as the practical challenges presented by beamline alignment. We show that the same general implementation of Bayesian optimization with special consideration for beamline alignment can quickly learn the dynamics of particular beamlines in an online fashion through hyperparameter fitting with no prior information. We present the implementation of a concise software framework for beamline alignment and test it on four different optimization problems for experiments on X-ray beamlines at the National Synchrotron Light Source II and the Advanced Light Source, and an electron beam at the Accelerator Test Facility, along with benchmarking on a simulated digital twin. We discuss new applications of the framework, and the potential for a unified approach to beamline alignment at synchrotron facilities. © 2024 International Union of Crystallography.

AB  - This article presents the guided Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm as an efficient data-driven method for iteratively tuning closed-loop controller parameters using a digital twin of the system. The digital twin is built using closed-loop data acquired during standard BO iterations, and activated when the uncertainty in the Gaussian Process model of the optimization objective on the real system is high. We define a controller tuning framework independent of the controller or the plant structure. Our proposed methodology is model-free, making it suitable for nonlinear and unmodelled plants with measurement noise. The objective function consists of performance metrics modeled by Gaussian processes. We utilize the available information in the closed-loop system to progressively maintain a digital twin that guides the optimizer, improving the data efficiency of our method. Switching the digital twin on and off is triggered by our data-driven criteria related to the digital twin’s uncertainty estimations in the BO tuning framework. Effectively, it replaces much of the exploration of the real system with exploration performed on the digital twin. We analyze the properties of our method in simulation and demonstrate its performance on two real closed-loop systems with different plant and controller structures. The experimental results show that our method requires fewer experiments on the physical plant than Bayesian optimization to find the optimal controller parameters. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Vaccine manufacturing fosters the prevention, control, and eradication of infectious diseases. Recombinant DNA and in vitro (IVT) mRNA vaccine manufacturing technologies were enforced to combat the recent pandemic. Despite the impact of these technologies, there exists no scientific announcement that compares them. Digital Shadows are employed in this study to simulate each technology, investigating root cause deviations, technical merits, and liabilities, evaluating cost scenarios. Under this lens we provide an unbiased, advanced comparative technoeconomic study, one that determines which of these manufacturing platforms are suited for the two types of vaccines considered (monoclonal antibodies or antigens). We find recombinant DNA technology to exhibit higher Profitability Index due to lower capital and starting material requirements, pertaining to lower Minimum Selling Price per Dose values, delivering products of established quality. However, the potency of the mRNA, the streamlined and scalable synthetic processes involved and the raw material availability, facilitate faster market penetration and product flexibility, constituting these vaccines preferable whenever short product development cycles become a necessity. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The development of intelligent chemical industry urgently calls for high-accuracy digital twin modeling methods of actual chemical processes. However, although intelligent technologies such as deep learning are utilized, digital twin modeling is challenged by the complexity and nonlinearity of actual chemical processes, leading to unexpected deviations and poor generalization. To provide a valuable modeling methodology in this field, a novel deep learning framework based on chemical process mechanisms is developed. According to the properties of different neural networks, the framework is designed in a hierarchical way to learn the underlying process mechanisms and deal with the nonlinearity of actual chemical processes. Thus, a digital twin model of the actual chemical process can be developed, which is high-accuracy and good-generalization. Based on the sensor data from the distributed control system of an actual industrial distillation process, the proposed deep learning digital twin modeling framework is verified by thoroughgoing and careful analyses, including the modeling test, ablation experiment and residue distribution analysis of model results. Compared with wide-spread baseline models, the new framework decreases the predicting mean absolute error by 45.6 % and increases the coefficient of determination by 13.8 % on average. This intelligent framework reveals desirable application potentials that it can create a high-fidelity digital twin of actual chemical processes. Such digital representation acts as a basic model, which can support advanced manufacturing tasks such as real-time optimization by detailed digital inference. This work provides an intelligent digital twin modeling methodology in chemical engineering and facilitates the development of intelligent chemical industry. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In digital twin technology, the operation of complex models and production logic consumes a large number of resources. Meanwhile, differences in hardware capabilities and user requirements make it difficult to ensure simulation accuracy and real-time performance, reducing system availability. To address this issue, a real-time synchronous computing framework for digital twin manufacturing equipment that collaboratively processed visualization and logic computation was proposed. Firstly, a digital model of the equipment was constructed based on multidimensional workshop information. According to hardware capabilities and users’ personalized computational needs, a configurable and adaptive system environment mapping method was introduced to adjust simulation fidelity, ensuring the real-time and correct operation of the twin equipment. The process was illustrated by using lighting environment mapping as an example. Secondly, a simulation-based motion logic solving algorithm for a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) manipulator was presented, which used the rendering frame time as the simulation clock advancement step to ensure accurate model motion and synchronization between visualization and computation. The algorithm was generalized for application to other multi-body equipment. Finally, a Web-based digital twin workshop modeling and simulation cloud platform was designed and developed. A 6-DOF manipulator and a specific bogie frame processing workshop were used as application cases, and the proposed method was validated. The results show that with the adaptive reduction of mapping fidelity, simulation response speed is increased by 45%, while GPU and CPU resource utilization is effectively reduced. It proves that the method can achieve reasonable resource allocation and efficient system computation while reducing error accumulation, making it a highly available real-time collaborative computing method. © 2025 Science Press.

AB  - The notion of (self-)adaptation, according to J. Holland (1975), describes the process of iterative refinement of an entity’s behavior or structure to improve its performance in its environment. We argue that the potential role of (self-)adaptive simulation models has not been sufficiently acknowledged in the past. A focus on adaptive simulation will likely propel methodological advances in modeling and simulation and digital twinning, increasing its impact on solving urgent real-world problems. Therefore, we will review methods for including adaptation as part of or within simulation models and consequently discuss how simulation models themselves may become the subject of adaptation within and across simulation studies. We will identify different motivations for and types of adaptations within simulation studies by analyzing a family of simulation models. The need to automatically conduct various types of adaptations increases with the importance of online adaptations, e.g. as encountered in digital twins. Further methodological developments in unambiguously representing and intelligently processing the various knowledge sources used in simulation studies, domain-specific languages, analysis methods, self-adaptive software, and, last but not least, model learning are needed. Combining the adaptation within and of simulation models, we arrive at the vision of self-adaptive models, which are less subject to adaptation but become the central actors in their adaptation. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The grinding process is a key link in mineral processing production and a typical complex, controlled process. The steady-state model is limited by its model structure and thus difficult to applyied in a control system. A hybrid modeling method driven by multi-source compensation is proposed in this paper based on the mechanism model using key equipment in the grinding and classification process, addressing the uncertainties which affect the stability of the control systems. This method combines the relevant multi-source signals with uncertainties by using a priori knowledge, extracts the nonlinear feature vector in the signal through an unsupervised depth network, and constructs a compensation model based on dynamic radial basis function network to realize the integration of mechanism modeling and data-driven compensation modeling. The simulation results show that the model has a high degree of fit to the real physical system; the industrial validation was conducted at a gold concentrator, the grinding product quality was predicted and controlled with the model. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Stochastic modeling techniques, such as discrete-event and agent-based simulation, are widely used in supply chain management (SCM) for capturing real-world uncertainties. Over the last decade, data-driven approaches like machine learning (ML) have also gained prominence in SCM, employing methods such as supervised learning (SL), unsupervised learning (UL), and reinforcement learning (RL). As supply chains grow in complexity, hybrid models combining simulation (Sim) and ML are becoming increasingly common, and the field stands to gain from a structured review of this literature. Towards this, we developed the Sim-ML Literature Classification Framework, which includes a hierarchical taxonomy comprising five SC criteria, 22 Sim-ML classes and over 75 Sim-ML subclasses. We applied this framework to synthesize 99 papers, revealing significant diversity in how Sim-ML models are used to address supply chain challenges. Key findings include the recognition of the breadth of study objectives, identifying various forms of model hybridization achieved by combining discrete/continuous simulation techniques with SL, UL, and RL approaches, and the data flow mechanisms such as sequential and feedback methods employed by the simulation and ML elements of the hybrid model. Our findings also identify some gaps in the literature; for example, optimization is rarely incorporated into Sim-ML models. Also, most studies present Sim-ML models for addressing problems in general supply chains, likely due to the lack of access to industrial data. The review also highlights that Industry 4.0 technologies, such as digital twins and blockchain, are underrepresented in current research, as are topics like sustainability and transportation. These gaps suggest significant opportunities for future research. We provide guidelines for practitioners on applying Sim-ML models to manage supply chain drivers, mitigate the impact of disruptions, and integrate emerging technologies. Our review serves as a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and students interested in leveraging Sim-ML approaches in SCM. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The high performance precision assembly (HPPA) of complex products such as aerospace, aircraft and high-end machine tool has demanding requirements for assembly accuracy. Achieving the accurate prediction of assembly accuracy for these complex products before assembling is the premise of improving the assembly quality and performance, and also has always been a challenge. Existing assembly accuracy prediction methods focus on acquiring the assembly deviation based on CAD model and manufacturing errors of parts, but rarely involve the multidimensional error coupling of parts and the influencing factors in the assembly process, which inevitably cause a certain gap between the prediction result and the actual condition, affecting the reliability of the prediction result. To address the above problems, this paper presents a digital twin (DT)-driven assembly accuracy prediction method for the HPPA of complex products. Firstly, this paper introduces the methodology overview and proposes an overall framework for DT-driven assembly accuracy prediction. Secondly, three key enabling technologies realizing the DT-driven assembly accuracy prediction, including the construction of part digital twin model, the generation of DT-based assembly process model, and assembly deviation propagation and accuracy analysis are introduced in detail. Finally, an application implementation of a prototype system and a case study involving a simplified satellite structure panel assembly process are used to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Beer production consists of a series of complex chemical, physical, and biological transformations. Although modern industrial production protocols are highly standardized, external and process disturbances often lead to degradation in beer quality. While models are available to predict beer quality, their widespread use is currently limited. Typically, these models rely on input variables from products that are almost complete; therefore, corrective measures cannot be implemented on time. Advanced modeling tools, such as digital twins, are effective alternatives to tackle this limitation, as they can integrate real-time process data into a digital model of the physical system to provide online predictions. To advance the development of such a tool, we have developed a hybrid model for beer quality prediction by combining different modeling frameworks and industrial process data. First, a dynamic model of industrial beer fermentation was calibrated that satisfactorily captured the kinetics of primary (extract) and quality-associated volatile compounds (pentanedione and butanedione). Second, a Naïve Bayes classifier for predicting beer quality was trained using physicochemical variables that identified the most critical attributes in a high-quality beer (ethyl acetate, total esters, foam stability, bitterness, and isoamyl acetate). Lastly, a hybrid regression model was constructed using fermentation model descriptors and external process data to predict the latter attributes with high prediction fidelity (less than 10% relative root mean squared error). The model identified yeast handling—including storage and propagation—and wort preparation as critical determinants of final product quality. Overall, this work represents a step toward developing a digital twin that can provide real-time process descriptors and integrate industrial data to optimize production and enhance beer quality. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We present MacKenzie, a HPC-driven multi-cluster workflow system that was used repeatedly to configure and execute fine-grained US national-scale epidemic simulation models during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mackenzie supported federal and Virginia policymakers, in real-time, for a large number of “what-if” scenarios during the COVID-19 pandemic, and continues to be used to answer related questions as COVID-19 transitions to the endemic stage of the disease. MacKenzie is a novel HPC meta-scheduler that can execute US-scale simulation models and associated workflows that typically present significant big data challenges. The meta-scheduler optimizes the total execution time of simulations in the workflow, and helps improve overall human productivity. As an exemplar of the kind of studies that can be conducted using Mackenzie, we present a modeling study to understand the impact of vaccine-acceptance in controlling the spread of COVID-19 in the US. We use a 288 million node synthetic social contact network (digital twin) spanning all 50 US states plus Washington DC, comprised of 3300 counties, with 12 billion daily interactions. The highly-resolved agent-based model used for the epidemic simulations uses realistic information about disease progression, vaccine uptake, production schedules, acceptance trends, prevalence, and social distancing guidelines. Computational experiments show that, for the simulation workload discussed above, MacKenzie is able to scale up well to 10 K CPU cores. Our modeling results show that, when compared to faster and accelerating vaccinations, slower vaccination rates due to vaccine hesitancy cause averted infections to drop from 6.7M to 4.5M, and averted total deaths to drop from 39.4 K to 28.2 K across the US. This occurs despite the fact that the final vaccine coverage is the same in both scenarios. We also find that if vaccine acceptance could be increased by 10% in all states, averted infections could be increased from 4.5M to 4.7M (a 4.4% improvement) and total averted deaths could be increased from 28.2 K to 29.9 K (a 6% improvement) nationwide. © 2024

AB  - The purpose of the PRODEC scenario-based design method is the incremental cross-fertilization and refinement of procedural scenarios and declarative configurations. It uses virtual prototypes of the developed systems (mainly life-critical systems) to conduct human-in-the-loop simulations (HITLSs). Based on human systems integration (HSI) principles and criteria, as well as expertise and experience in the domain at stake, this HSI approach grounded in virtual environments requires a clear definition of physical and cognitive tangibility metrics to assess the distance between virtual and tangible (grasp) dimensions of the system being developed when it is put to work. PRODEC considers human and machine systems described in terms of structures and functions incrementally designed using procedural scenarios (i.e., stories) in task and activity networks, which provide life to declarative configurations (i.e., system's functions and structures). This active modeling and simulation process enables the discovery of emergent structures and functions of the system being developed when it is virtually operated. PRODEC's use is illustrated in an example. We discuss the use of PRODEC and its results as to how they can be used with digital twins. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Research background:Internet of Things devices and sensors, artificial intelligence-based digital asset trading and digital twin-based extended reality technologies, and autonomous robotic and enterprise resource planning systems can be leveraged in 3D semantic scene completion and metaverse-based commercial transactions across Internet of Things-based business environments. Distributed ledger and enterprise business technologies, shop-floor digital twin synthetic data, and 3D simulation and visualization systems configure integrated multiphysics workflows in hyper-realistic immersive industrial environments for artificial intelligence-based business value. Digital twin-based Internet of Robotic Things, robotic swarm and multi-modal machine learning algorithms (with regard to enterprise total factor productivity), and virtual and augmented reality simulation technologies are pivotal in spatial planning processes. Industrial product data and manufacturing value chain management support digital twin-based virtual factory modeling in collaborative immersive 3D visualization environments. Purpose of the article: We show that interconnected business process management and metaverse economic organizational structures, immersive economic and entrepreneurial knowledge image-based modeling (for big data-driven product development processes), and remote autonomous equipment control and monitoring integrate digital twin-enabled 6G Tactile Industrial Internet of Things, deep reinforcement learning and image processing algorithms, and event-driven signal processing for collaborative economic value co-creation. Deep learning-based visual recognition and industrial extended reality technologies, 3D production management modeling, and Internet of Things industrial and mobile sensing networks are pivotal in production operation management, as deep learning-based multi-source data fusion assists autonomous industrial manufacturing processes across interactive 3D immersive business and synthetic manufacturing environments. Collaborative robotic cyber-physical production and generative Artificial Intelligence of Things-based systems (in terms of managerial business value), artificial intelligence-based perceptual and cognitive technologies, and spatial mapping and machine intelligence algorithms enhance manufacturing process visualization, as industrial big data sharing and interoperability are functional in 3D semantic scene completion for sustainable business and economic growth across big data-driven immersive virtual industrial manufacturing environments. Methods: We inspected Tracxn (the Industrial Metaverse section) for the first 100 companies in terms of Tracxn score for X-corn status (i.e., Minicorn, Soonicorn, or none), total equity funding (USD), and company stage (i.e., Seed, Funding Raised, Unfunded, Public, Acquired, Acqui-Hired, and Series A, B, C, D), and identified three main topics for analysis that would lead to tangible business outcomes. We examined the performance management of shop floor virtualization: connected digital twins increase production and logistics process optimization in production environments across the industrial metaverse, facilitating photorealistic production system 3D modelling and simulation. We appraised integrated diagnostic functionalities of real-time simulation implementation for error elimination and machine parameter adjustment in immersive planned production lines by synthetic image data sets and collaborative workflows. We determined digital twin-based data synthesis operational procedures and interconnected use cases across industrial scalable infrastructures for value chain efficiency. Findings & value added: We identified the specific integrated operational simulation functions and production tasks, key performance indicators of shop floor autonomous and value creation systems, and industrial process parameters for predictive quality and fault detection, resulting in production loss reduction by use of industrial metaverse technologies. By use of operational data with regard to the technological management of the selected companies, quantitative analysis determines how immersive collaborative business process and extended reality-driven industrial metaverse technologies lead to economic value co-creation across 3D digital twin factories and cyber-physical manufacturing enterprises. The main value added derived from our research is that cloud-based collaborative 3D visualization and neuromorphic computing systems, 6G sensing and holographic simulation technologies, and machine intelligence and environment awareness algorithms (for business performance and productivity) can be leveraged in machine vision-based defect prediction, detection, diagnosis, and management. Virtual reality space convergence and object connection operate in Internet of Things-based sensing device performance monitoring across Internet of Things-based business environments. Virtual assembly lines and manufacturing enterprises necessitate machine learning-based production forecasting techniques, 3D object detection and tracking, and industrial autonomous and cyber-physical production systems, supporting spatial computing and predictive maintenance algorithms in collaborative immersive virtual environments. © Instytut Badań Gospodarczych /Institute of Economic Research (Poland).

AB  - The steelmaking–continuous casting section is a critical part that determines the quality of steel products. It highlights the characteristics of matter state transformation, matter property control, and mass flow management during steel production. The production process is highly complex and involves intricate physical and chemical reactions, as well as heat and mass transfer processes between multiple components. Additionally, there is a coupling of the temperature field and flow field within the high-temperature molten metal reaction vessel. The process is also marked by high dynamics, nonlinearity, and significant uncertainty. The regulatory mechanism is not well understood and is easily influenced by factors such as raw material composition and process operation, which leads to complex operational control and significant fluctuations in product quality and makes it difficult to achieve collaborative manufacturing with intelligent technologies in the production process. Therefore, it is urgent to break through key technologies such as data cognition and production decision-making in the steelmaking–continuous casting process. This would help promote high-quality, efficient, green, and low-carbon production while enhancing the digital and intelligent capabilities of the steel industry. According to the technological framework for collaborative manufacturing with intelligent technologies in the steelmaking–continuous casting section, this study explores various scales, including the unit device scale, workshop process scale, and steelmaking–continuous casting process scale. A comprehensive system level was established by integrating and synthesizing data levels, process device levels, process interface levels, and planning and scheduling levels. In-depth research was conducted on vertical and horizontal collaborative intelligent manufacturing across these different levels and processes. Systematic modeling and development were performed from process manufacturing at the process/device scale to the manufacturing at the steelmaking–continuous casting section. First, process control models for the converter, refining, and continuous casting processes were developed at the process/device level. Subsequently, a multi-process collaborative control model was constructed at the process linkage, production planning, and scheduling levels. The comprehensive integration and dynamic collaboration of manufacturing execution system (MES), process control, process operation control, and production planning and scheduling systems were achieved through the development of key process control models, production planning and scheduling models, and data interfaces between MES, dynamic knowledge graphs, and digital twins systems. Additionally, the autonomous evolution of cognitive knowledge graphs and the visualization of virtual space twins are successfully realized. This effort involves comprehensive modeling and development, which progress from the steelmaking–continuous casting section’s process/device level to the planning and scheduling level. Ultimately, it reaches the system integration level and encompasses both cognitive knowledge graphs and digital twin systems. The study enables collaborative operation control and dynamic decision-making for the steelmaking–continuous casting section by leveraging mechanistic models, data models, and expert knowledge synergistically, along with bidirectional interactions between virtual and real models and horizontal and vertical collaboration across multiple processes and levels. The results provide a significant reference value for the intelligent, green, and high-end development of the metallurgical industry. They also offer valuable insights for intelligent manufacturing in process industries and contribute substantially to advancing new productive forces in the steel industry and addressing critical challenges. © 2025 Science Press.

AB  - Aims: Lethal arrhythmias in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are widely attributed to myocardial ischaemia and fibrosis. How these factors modulate arrhythmic risk remains largely unknown, especially as invasive mapping protocols are not routinely used in these patients. By leveraging multiscale digital twin technologies, we aim to investigate ischaemic mechanisms of increased arrhythmic risk in HCM. Methods and results: Computational models of human HCM cardiomyocytes, tissue, and ventricles were used to simulate outcomes of Phase 1A acute myocardial ischaemia. Cellular response predictions were validated with patch-clamp studies of human HCM cardiomyocytes (n = 12 cells, N = 5 patients). Ventricular simulations were informed by typical distributions of subendocardial/transmural ischaemia as analysed in perfusion scans (N = 28 patients). S1-S2 pacing protocols were used to quantify arrhythmic risk for scenarios in which regions of septal obstructive hypertrophy were affected by (i) ischaemia, (ii) ischaemia and impaired repolarization, and (iii) ischaemia, impaired repolarization, and diffuse fibrosis. HCM cardiomyocytes exhibited enhanced action potential and abnormal effective refractory period shortening to ischaemic insults. Analysis of ∼75 000 re-entry induction cases revealed that the abnormal HCM cellular response enabled establishment of arrhythmia at milder ischaemia than otherwise possible in healthy myocardium, due to larger refractoriness gradients that promoted conduction block. Arrhythmias were more easily sustained in transmural than subendocardial ischaemia. Mechanisms of ischaemia-fibrosis interaction were strongly electrophysiology dependent. Fibrosis enabled asymmetric re-entry patterns and break-up into sustained ventricular tachycardia. Conclusion: HCM ventricles exhibited an increased risk to non-sustained and sustained re-entry, largely dominated by an impaired cellular response and deleterious interactions with the diffuse fibrotic substrate.  © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - In the face of a changing climate and a rising number of “food deserts" in both rural and urban areas, there is a demand to supply fresh produce year-round to communities at the end of the traditional agriculture supply chain. Vertical indoor farming is a promising mode of next-generation agriculture that boasts reduced water and pesticide usage, improved yields, more consistent quality, year-round cultivation, and cheaper transportation and harvesting costs. Indoor farms can rival industrial greenhouses in size, but small-scale “pod farms" can be deployed to smaller communities and areas where large swaths of land are either unavailable or too costly. These pods are often the size of shipping containers with their temperature, humidity, and plant nutrient supply carefully controlled. Plants inside the pods are grown hydroponically with light supplied by panels of LEDs and, thus, this mode of farming is fundamentally different from greenhouse farming. Many indoor farming pods have recently become commercially available claiming high energy efficiency, but little analysis and optimization work has been done to prove these claims. To drive innovation in the design of these physical systems, we have developed a digital-twin and genomic optimization framework for the optical design of vertical indoor farming pods. We model a completely enclosed indoor farming pod with plants in the three mutually-orthogonal planes and illuminated by LED “walls." We employ ray-tracing methods and a genetic algorithm to determine the LED source tube area size, beam aperture spread, and power requirements for maximal power absorption by the plants. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to simulate the process of isobaric evaporative crystallization of sucrose to substantiate new ways of its industrial implementation. Using computer simulation, a three-stage crystallization technology for semi-continuous boiling of massecuites on a prepared crystalline base of a seed suspension (first stage) and a crystalline base of the preceding massecuite (second and third stages) was designed. A computer computational model of the express method for determining the molasses saturation coefficient has been created. By heating to a temperature of 50–55 °C, the molasses is transferred to an unsaturated state, then oscillating white sugar crystals are partially dissolved until saturation is reached while under conductometric control. The method makes it possible to determine the optimal parameters of standard molasses, taking into account the technical characteristics of crystallization equipment and centrifuges. On the basis of simulation modeling in the VisSim software environment, tests were carried out, and a justification was given for the technology of semi-continuous boiling of massecuite massecuites to increase the efficiency of crystallization in batch vacuum pans. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The manufacturing industry is facing increasing challenges to improve sustainability performance by using Industry 4.0 technologies like big data analytics, the internet of things, and digital twins, considering their potentials. However, effectively integrating sustainability goals and Industry 4.0 technologies within manufacturing systems can be challenging due to real-time attribute data of digital twins of machinery obtained by IoT tools and the necessity to integrate them into production planning levels. This challenge can be addressed by developing a framework for optimizing the flow of operations in a manufacturing system while incorporating sustainability assessment and Industry 4.0 technologies effectively. This paper investigates the integration of sustainability assessment considering Industry 4.0 technologies and the use of Markov Decision Process capabilities. The framework utilizes Markov Decision Process to model the decision-making process of the manufacturing system and its decision-makers. It includes sustainability goals as constraints or objectives in the Markov Decision Process model. The use of Industry 4.0 technologies is integrated into the framework to gather data and optimize the decision-making process based on that data. The capabilities of the proposed framework are demonstrated through case studies of a single agent on a shop floor. The findings from the case study indicate that the proposed framework can effectively support decision-making at the top-tier level of the enterprise by integrating sustainability assessment and the Industry 4.0 paradigm. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Sustainability should become a key concern in the next generation of engineered systems. While this expectation is relatively straightforward, the question of how to get there is less obvious. The multi-dimensional and intricate nature of sustainability poses challenges in designing sustainable systems and analyzing sustainability properties. Finding trade-offs between economic, environmental, societal, and technological aspects of sustainability is a wicked problem and calls for advanced modeling and simulation methods. In this paper, we report on a panel discussion held at the 28th Working Conference on Exploring Modeling Methods for Systems Analysis and Development (EMMSAD) with four esteemed experts representing four complementary and often conflicting perspectives on the role of modeling for sustainability – stakeholders, digitalization, degrowth and IT, and ethics. We report the key arguments of the panelists, discuss the roles of modeling in the analysis and design of sustainable systems, and, finally, elaborate on the conflicts among the perspectives, their effects, and potential resolutions. © 2024 by the Association for Information Systems.

AB  - Numerical method is widely used for solving the mechanistic models of chromatography process, but it is time-consuming and hard to response in real-time. Physics-informed neural network (PINN) as an emerging technology combines the structure of neural network with physics laws, and is getting noticed for solving physics problems with a balanced accuracy and calculation speed. In this research, a proof-of-concept study was carried out to apply PINN to chromatography process simulation. The PINN model structure was designed for the lumped kinetic model (LKM) with all LKM parameters. The PINN structure, training data and model complexity were optimized, and an optimal mode was obtained by adopting an in-series structure with a nonuniform training data set focusing on the breakthrough transition region. A PINN for LKM (LKM-PINN) consisting of four neural networks, 12 layers and 606 neurons was then used for the simulation of breakthrough curves of chromatography processes. The LKM parameters were estimated with two breakthrough curves and used to infer the breakthrough curves at different residence times, loading concentrations and column sizes. The results were comparable to that obtained with numerical methods. With the same raw data and constraints, the average fitting error for LKM-PINN model was 0.075, which was 0.081 for numerical method. With the same initial guess, the LKM-PINN model took 160 s to complete the fitting, while the numerical method took 7 to 72 min, depending on the fitting settings. The fitting speed of LKM-PINN model was further improved to 30 s with random initial guess. Thus, the LKM-PINN model developed in this study is capable to be applied to real-time simulation for digital twin. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aims to experimentally confirm whether knowledge that has been challenging to transfer through traditional on-the-job training (OJT) can be effectively transferred by introducing a formalized OJT approach that describes the improvement process knowledge of skilled production systems consultants, facilitating imitation by unskilled consultants. We adopted the Digital Triplet (D3) concept, an extension of the authors’ digital twin framework to intelligent activities, aligning with our study objectives. Recognizing the difficulty and inadequacy of knowledge transfer in production systems consulting OJT, we propose an OJT support method integrating a decision-making modeling approach for skilled consultants’ processes based on the Generalized Production Systems Consulting Process Model (GCPM) from prior literature into traditional OJT methods involving self-learning and direct instruction. This method enables the construction of a domain-specific GCPM, formalizing the improvement process flow implemented by skilled consultants and linking it to production improvement expertise and tools. In a case study focused on energy-saving improvement, we constructed and tested a domain-specific GCPM’s efficacy in facilitating the transfer of difficult-to-transfer knowledge. The results indicate that domain-specific GCPM facilitates such knowledge transfer, including specialized improvement, knowledge utilization, rationale, and adaptation to specific cases. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Trees are an important part of the cityscape, and 3D models of trees are indispensable for real-time 3D design, construction of virtual geographic environments, and construction of digital twin cities. Current 3D models of trees are reconstructed based on images or model libraries. The former show cluttered triangular network clusters, and the latter are vastly different from the real situation in terms of geometric expression and realism, which makes directly using the reconstructed tree models in the practical applications of smart cities difficult. Therefore, in this paper, a bionic reconstruction method for 3D tree models is proposed based on high-precision laser scanning point cloud data for building realistic scenes in virtual geographic environments, which enables the automated reconstruction of 3D tree models at multiple levels of detail while preserving morphological features. First, a skeleton-based parametric tree model reconstruction method that extracts branch geometry by generalized cylinder fitting and extracts the trunk, main branches, models of fine branches, and crown elements in a hierarchical manner according to the growth parameters of the tree is proposed. Second, the refinement requirements of modeling distinct parts of trees are considered, and a refined tree geometry reconstruction method by integrating the conformal Poisson network and parametric fitting is presented. Finally, the texture mapping method is applied to map the texture of multilevel tree branches automatically to achieve a detailed 3D reconstruction of tree models by considering the texture extension of the tree structure. Based on the laser point cloud acquired with a backpack or station, this method can produce a refined 3D tree model with high accuracy of morphological features. The overall geometric error of the model is better than 10 cm, and the geometric error of the trunk model is better than 3 cm. Under the same data conditions, the method has the highest degree of reproduction of 3D tree morphology and real texture compared with various mainstream tree modeling methods. Based on the results of this paper, the method can further advance the extraction of tree structure information and the calculation of 3D green volume for the realistic 3D China and national strategies such as green low-carbon development, which have great practical value. This paper proposes a 3D bionic reconstruction method for constructing high-fidelity scenes in virtual geographic environments to achieve highly accurate geometric reconstruction and texture mapping of individual tree roots, trunks, branches, and leaves. The core of the method is to consider the requirements of distinct parts of the tree reconstruction at multiple levels of detail and integrate Poisson mesh and parameter fitting to complete the 3D reconstruction of the tree with high accuracy. The experimental results show the proposed tree 3D reconstruction method provides a highly accurate reconstruction of the tree geometry and texture. The research results are used for the accurate extraction of tree parameters, which can provide an important basis for tree structure information extraction, 3D green volume calculation, and realistic modeling and simulation of virtual geographic environments. © 2024 Science Press.

AB  - Harmful algal and cyanobacterial blooms (HABs), occurring in inland and maritime waters, pose threats to natural environments by producing toxins that affect human and animal health. In the past, HABs have been assessed mainly by the manual collection and subsequent analysis of water samples and occasionally by automatic instruments that acquire information from fixed locations. These procedures do not provide data with the desirable spatial and temporal resolution to anticipate the formation of HABs. Hence, new tools and technologies are needed to efficiently detect, characterize and respond to HABs that threaten water quality. It is essential nowadays when the world’s water supply is under tremendous pressure because of climate change, overexploitation, and pollution. This paper introduces Discrete Event System Specification-BLOOM, a novel framework for real-time monitoring and management of HABs. Its purpose is to support high-performance hazard detection with model-based system engineering and cyber-physical systems infrastructure for dynamic environments. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Decentralized manufacturing systems constrained by blockchain significantly enhances data security and process integrity. Nevertheless, intelligent workshops encounter hurdles related to scalability of nodes, efficiency in validation, configuration of process security, and management of online/offline operations, which pose challenges to the seamless application of blockchain in workshop manufacturing environments. This paper introduces an architecture based on BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) for integrating smart contracts and digital twins manufacturing systems. It explores effective strategies to address the challenges mentioned above, with the aim of enhancing integration and application approaches. (1) Utilizing a graphical model-driven solution for the visualization and configuration of manufacturing resources on the front end, creating a BPMN-driven orchestration diagram and an off-chain/on-chain interoperability model for manufacturing smart contracts, and investigating voting mechanisms and customization methods specific to smart contracts in workshop manufacturing; (2) The two-layer monitoring model based on blockchain 3.0 and Tangle-based verification backend is established by introducing Cached DTs to implement negotiation of smart contracts based on BPMN constraints at the upper level, and supporting device node expansion and verification mechanisms at the lower level, thereby realizing swift synchronization and comprehensive visualization across the entire manufacturing lifecycle; (3) Based on multiple open-source technologies, a decentralized intelligent workshop case that relies on distributed information management is constructed. The comprehensive experimental results underscore the technical superiority of the proposed system architecture. © 2024 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers

AB  - Developing accurate mathematical or data-driven models for effective controller design under dynamic variable conditions becomes increasingly challenging. For this reason, the concept of a digital twin (DT) as a virtual representation of a physical asset has been introduced as a tool for process modelling, design, and control implementation while providing additional knowledge of the system that can be used to enable awareness capabilities on the asset. However, digital twin models used to be complex, requiring expensive computational times depending on the application to provide the most accurate system representation, limiting its application in edge, embedded, and register transfer level computing domains. Therefore, using reduced-order digital twin models is an alternative to get DT closer to the physical asset. Considering these challenges, we propose a reduced-order FPGA-based digital twin implementation that directly sources data from the real system, operates in parallel with the virtual system, and enables awareness mechanisms to improve the system's operation. This setup removes large data transfers, cloud interfaces and expensive computational times deriving into a faster and more efficient DT. To illustrate the capabilities of this embedded digital twin, we present a case study focused on monitoring a power converter. The study involves establishing and enforcing a safe operating area (SOA) for the power converter, implementing error awareness mechanisms, and enabling machine learning models to predict converter load conditions and fault events detection. Thus, we aim to showcase the effectiveness of our proposed FPGA-based digital twin approach in addressing real-time control challenges towards smart control engineering.  © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In the past decade, human digital twins (HDTs) attracted attention in both digital twin (DT) applications and beyond. In this paper, we discuss the concept and the development of HDTs, focusing on their architecture, key enabling technologies, and (potential) applications. Based on the literature, we identify personal data, model, and interface as three key modules in the proposed HDT architecture, supported by a data lake of human data and a model and interface library. Regarding the key enabling technologies that support the HDT functions, we envision that the internet of things (IoT) infrastructure, data security, wearables, human modeling, explainable artificial intelligence (AI) , minimum viable sensing, and data visualization are closely associated with the development of HDTs. Finally, we investigate current applications of HDTs, with a particular emphasis on the opportunities that arise from leveraging HDTs in the field of personalized product design. © 2023 by ASME.

AB  - A critical requirement for robust, optimized, and secure design of vehicular systems is the ability to do system-level exploration, i.e., comprehend the interactions involved among electronic control units (ECUs), sensors, and communication interfaces in realizing system-level use cases and the impact of various design choices on these interactions. This must be done early in the system design to enable the designer to make optimal design choices without requiring a cost-prohibitive design overhaul. In this article, we develop a virtual prototyping environment for the modeling and simulation of vehicular systems. Our solution, ViVE, is modular and configurable, allowing the user to conveniently introduce new system-level use cases. Unlike other related simulation environments, our platform emphasizes coordination and communication among various vehicular components and just the abstraction of the necessary computation of each ECU. We discuss the ability of ViVE to explore the interactions between a number of realistic use cases in the automotive domain. We demonstrate the utility of the platform, in particular, to create real-time in-vehicle communication optimizers for various optimization targets. We also show how to use such a prototyping environment to explore vehicular security compromises. Furthermore, we showcase the experimental integration and validation of the platform with a hardware setup in a real-time scenario.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The integration of Digital Twin technology in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has brought forth a transformative paradigm in engineering practices. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the use of Digital Twin in SMEs and its implementation of advanced digital technologies in an engineering context. The paper highlights key benefits, such as the ability to simulate, analyze, and predict the behavior of products or processes before their physical instantiation. By leveraging advanced modeling and simulation techniques, SMEs can efficiently explore multiple design iterations, identify potential issues, and optimize engineering solutions without costly physical prototyping. Furthermore, the paper discusses integrating other advanced digital technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), with Digital Twin to create intelligent and interconnected systems. The implementation of Digital Twin technology in SMEs extends beyond product design to encompass various aspects of the product lifecycle, fostering efficiency, accuracy, and innovation. However, challenges such as data integration, cybersecurity, and skill requirements are addressed. With proper planning and investment, SMEs can unlock the full potential of Digital Twin technology to gain a competitive edge in the dynamic engineering domain. In conclusion, this paper demonstrates that the use of Digital Twin in SMEs and its integration with advanced digital technologies revolutionizes engineering practices. By offering virtual representations of physical assets and processes, Digital Twin enables SMEs to make informed decisions, optimize performance, and drive innovation. As the technology evolves, it becomes an indispensable tool for SMEs seeking to thrive in the ever-evolving engineering landscape. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - Cardiac in silico clinical trials can virtually assess the safety and efficacy of therapies using human-based modelling and simulation. These technologies can provide mechanistic explanations for clinically observed pathological behaviour. Designing virtual cohorts for in silico trials requires exploiting clinical data to capture the physiological variability in the human population. The clinical characterisation of ventricular activation and the Purkinje network is challenging, especially non-invasively. Our study aims to present a novel digital twinning pipeline that can efficiently generate and integrate Purkinje networks into human multiscale biventricular models based on subject-specific clinical 12-lead electrocardiogram and magnetic resonance recordings. Essential novel features of the pipeline are the human-based Purkinje network generation method, personalisation considering ECG R wave progression as well as QRS morphology, and translation from reduced-order Eikonal models to equivalent biophysically-detailed monodomain ones. We demonstrate ECG simulations in line with clinical data with clinical image-based multiscale models with Purkinje in four control subjects and two hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients (simulated and clinical QRS complexes with Pearson's correlation coefficients > 0.7). Our methods also considered possible differences in the density of Purkinje myocardial junctions in the Eikonal-based inference as regional conduction velocities. These differences translated into regional coupling effects between Purkinje and myocardial models in the monodomain formulation. In summary, we demonstrate a digital twin pipeline enabling simulations yielding clinically consistent ECGs with clinical CMR image-based biventricular multiscale models, including personalised Purkinje in healthy and cardiac disease conditions. © 2024

AB  - The industry is currently undergoing a digital revolution driven by the integration of several enabling technologies. These include automation, robotics, cloud computing, industrial cybersecurity, systems integration, digital twins, etc. Of particular note is the increasing use of digital twins, which offer significant added value by providing realistic and fully functional process simulations. This paper proposes an approach for developing digital twins in industrial environments. The novelty lies in not only focusing on obtaining the model of the industrial system and integrating virtual reality and/or augmented reality but also in emphasizing the importance of incorporating other enabled technologies of Industry 4.0, such as system integration, connectivity with standard and specific industrial protocols, cloud services, or new industrial automation systems, to enhance the capabilities of the digital twin. Furthermore, a proposal of the software tools that can be used to achieve this incorporation is made. Unity is chosen as the real-time 3D development tool for its cross-platform capability and streamlined industrial system modeling. The integration of augmented reality is facilitated by the Vuforia SDK. Node-RED is selected as the system integration option, and communications are carried out with MQTT protocol. Finally, cloud-based services are recommended for effective data storage and processing. Furthermore, this approach has been used to develop a digital twin of a robotic electro-pneumatic cell. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The optimised design, operation and management of complex, large-size Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs)–like modern manufacturing and logistic assets–calls for Digital Twins (DTs) in which dynamic modelling and simulation play a relevant role. In such simulation-based DTs computational efficiency is crucial. According to the present state of the art, the said efficiency is hindered by the way the Cyber part of a CPS is represented, which in the manufacturing case practically corresponds to representing digital controls. This paper proposes a modelling framework for an efficient and scalable representation of the Cyber part in a DT of a CPS. The presented solution is based on Object-Oriented Modelling (OOM) and IEC industrial standards. Motivating and explanatory examples are provided, and a proof-of-concept case study is discussed to support the framework potential and industrial viability. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In the era of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing, Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) stands at the forefront, driving a paradigm shift towards automated, digitalized production. However, online simulation remains a technical barrier toward building a Digital Twin (DT) for metallic AM due to the prolonged computing time of numerical simulations and limitations in accuracy of current data-driven models. This study addresses these issues by introducing an adaptive online simulation model for predicting distortion fields, utilizing a diffusion model architecture for distortion process modelling with a Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder coupled with Generative Adversarial Network (VQVAE-GAN) backbone for spatial feature extraction, complemented by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for time-scale result fusion. Pretrained offline with Finite Element Method (FEM) simulated distortion fields, the model successfully predicts distortion fields online using laser-scanned point clouds during the deposition process. Experimental validation on seven thin-wall structures demonstrated its superior performance, achieving a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) below 0.9 m, outperforming FEM by 143 % and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based methods by 151 %, marking a significant stride towards realizing an AM-DT. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Digital twin (DT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are powerful enablers for Industry 4.0 toward sustainable resilient manufacturing. Digital twins of machine tools and machining processes combine advanced digital techniques and production domain knowledge, facilitate the enhancement of agility, traceability, and resilience of production systems, and help machine tool builders achieve a paradigm shift from one-time products provision to on-going service delivery. However, the adaptability and accuracy of digital twins at the shopfloor level are restricted by heterogeneous data sources, modeling precision as well as uncertainties from dynamical industrial environments. This article proposes a novel modeling framework to address these inadequacies by in-depth integrating AI techniques and machine tool expertise using aggregated data along the product development process. A data processing procedure is constructed to contextualize metadata sources from the design, planning, manufacturing, and quality stages and link them into a digital thread. On this consistent data basis, a modeling pipeline is presented to incorporate production and machine tool prior knowledge into AI development pipeline, while considering the multi-fidelity nature of data sources in dynamic industrial circumstances. In terms of implementation, we first introduce our existing work for building digital twins of machine tool and manufacturing process. Within this infrastructure, we developed a hybrid learning-based digital twin for manufacturing process following proposed modeling framework and tested it in an external industrial project exemplarily for real-time workpiece quality monitoring. The result indicates that the proposed hybrid learning-based digital twin enables learning uncertainties of the interaction of machine tools and machining processes in real industrial environments, thus allows estimating and enhancing the modeling reliability, depending on the data quality and accessibility. Prospectively, it also contributes to the reparametrization of model parameters and to the adaptive process control. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper presents a systematic literature review on the application of digital twins in the energy sector. Initially, we generated an overview through a survey of prior reviews, independent of market vertical, then followed by a more detailed review concentrating on the power production and distribution domains, as per the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) smart grid standard. We implemented a rigorous method, which included seven stages, beginning with the collection of 2238 articles. We observed that the energy sector range was too broad and filtered by generation and distribution during the practical screening, resulting in 275 for further screening. This amount was then condensed to 81 papers that matched the quality screening criteria for synthesis and examination. In summary, digital twin architectures and frameworks include five components: the physical entity, bidirectional communication, the virtual entity (with modeling and simulation), data management, and services. Our study contributed by determining that distribution management is the most pertinent application of digital twins in the distribution domain and fault diagnosis in the generation domain. Furthermore, we found that digital twins involve multiple stakeholders whose role is rarely discussed in studies, and we identified a similar absence of emphasis for security. Research on security often presents the digital twin as an additional layer of protection, yet rarely investigates the security of the digital twin by itself. The potential limitations of our study to answer some of the technical research questions may be because of the criteria for the selection of papers. However, as the emphasis of this study is on the energy sector, it enabled domain-specific findings for generation and distribution. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - One of the challenges in twinned systems is ensuring the digital twin remains a valid representation of the system it twins. Depending on the type of twinning occurring, it is either trivial, such as in dashboarding/visualizations that mirror the system with real-time data, or challenging, in case the digital twin is a simulation model that reflects the behavior of a physical twinned system. The challenge in this latter case comes from the fact that in contrast to software systems, physical systems are not immutable once deployed, but instead they evolve through processes like maintenance, wear and tear or user error. It is therefore important to detect when changes occur in the physical system to evolve the twin alongside it. We employ and reuse validation techniques from model-based design for this goal. Model validation is one of the steps used to gain trust in the representativeness of a simulation model. In this work, we provide two contributions: (i) We provide a generic approach that, through the use of validation metrics, is able to detect anomalies in twinned systems, and (ii) We demonstrate these techniques with the help of an academic yet industrially relevant case study of a gantry crane such as found in ports. Treating anomalies also means correcting the error in the digital twin, which we do with a parameter estimation based on the historical data. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Digital twins are expected to be applied in the chemical process industry as important technology for improving productivity and profits. While research and development is being conducted on elemental technologies related to digital twins such as sensing, communication, data management and utilization, and optimization, detailed flow models are necessary to reproduce flow inside equipment used in chemical processes. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is essential in equipment design because it can provide high-fidelity field data to better understand flow physics. CFD has been used to analyse flow and mass transfer in various equipment. However, CFD simulations, especially for unsteady flows, are computationally expensive because they must march the flow solution with a small step in time. Introducing CFD into digital twins, there is a need to reduce the above cost and make unsteady CFD more affordable. In this study, the reduced order modelling of CFD using snapshot proper orthogonal decomposition (snapshot POD) and deep neural networks was applied to a Taylor-Couette crystallizer, which has a double cylindrical structure with an inner cylinder and an outer cylinder and is characterized by periodic vortices (called Taylor-Couette flow) generated by shear when the inner cylinder is rotated. Previous research reported that Taylor-Couette flow is effective in promoting nucleation and crystal growth. This study showed that the reduced order model (ROM) developed in this study is 1000 times faster than CFD and can accurately predict the flow that changes depending on the rotation speed of the inner cylinder. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As digitalization is permeating all sectors of society toward the concept of “smart everything,” and virtual technologies and data are gaining a dominant place in the engineering and control of intelligent systems, the Digital Twin (DT) concept has surfaced as one of the top technologies to adopt. This paper discusses the DT concept from the viewpoint of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) experts. It both provides literature review elements and adopts a commentary-driven approach. We first examine the DT from a historical perspective, tracing the historical development of M&S from its roots in computational experiments to its applications in various fields and the birth of DT-related and allied concepts. We then approach DTs as an evolution of M&S, acknowledging the overlap in these different concepts. We also look at the M&S workflow and its evolution toward a DT workflow from a software engineering perspective, highlighting significant changes. Finally, we look at new challenges and requirements DTs entail, potentially leading to a revolutionary shift in M&S practices. In this way, we hope to foster the discussion on DTs and provide the M&S expert with innovative perspectives. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Biodiesel production comprises several interconnected process steps with complex dynamic behavior. Dynamic plant modeling and simulation enhance process understanding and enable model-based control. We present a modular and rigorous dynamic model for biodiesel and glycerol production by alkali-catalyzed oil transesterification. We share the implemented model in Modelica open-source. Moreover, we implement two plantwide control (PWC) structures, where we assume the availability of information-rich measurements in the first and only conventional measurements in the second. To study the process dynamic behavior, we investigate several disturbance scenarios, demonstrating the importance of the plantwide perspective. The PWC structure based on an information-rich configuration shows satisfactory control performance, whereas the other fails to always satisfy product quality requirements, underlining the importance of developing dynamic models for advanced control and estimation techniques. Moreover, the model can be used as a digital twin for industrial plants as well as for model-based control and estimation applications. © 2023 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.

AB  - Geographic analysis models serve as crucial resources for tackling geo-problems, simulating geographic environments, and supporting decision-making analysis. They play a key role in constructing virtual geographic environments (also known as digital twin geographic environments). Integrating geographic analysis models with diverse simulation capabilities from various fields enables a comprehensive representation of real geographical environments. This integration supports the development of visual, usable, analyzable, and interactive virtual geographic environments. This study systematically examines the current research progress in the integration methods of geographic analysis models. In general, integrating physical and social processes and merging big data with deep learning have gained increased attention in recent years. Compared with using a single model, multimodel integration enhances the understanding of the objective geographical world by integrating multiple elements and processes. Integrating models within a single domain or across domains ultimately involves basic execution links, such as combining, nesting, and connecting multiple models in a specific computing environment. In response to this, customized integration and modular integration are the main approaches to current geographical analysis model integration research. Customized integration offers tailored solutions for specific models considering cognitive and technical characteristics. However, it is heavily influenced by individual model characteristics and may become unsustainable during the integration of numerous models, leading to frequent revision activities. Modular integration relies on standardized components with clear association logic and supports component replacement. However, it faces strong technical dependencies and constraints, such as those that involve programming language, data structure, and operating environment. In practice, current model integration research often varies between customization and modularity, with the former lacking sustainability and the latter being limited by compatibility issues. In this study, the idea of a “geographic analysis model container” is proposed, and the methods are implemented to address the problems mentioned. With the assistance of the concept of containerization, the data, programs, and computing resources upon which geographical models rely are loaded into a “container.” Then, the model is developed in a customized manner within the container, while the modular model integration work occurs outside the container. Striking a balance between customized and modular approaches is anticipated to enhance the overall effectiveness of geographic modeling and simulation efforts. Conducting a multilevel, multigranularity, and multiscale integration across elements, processes, and functional relationships is necessary for addressing specific geographical problems. The development of “geographic analysis model containers” tailored to express geographical system evolution laws and driving mechanisms has become crucial. Accumulating and improving model integration capabilities based on containers is expected to establish an effective bridge between model construction, transformation, and integration. This advancement can promote geographical models from experimental tools to essential components of social service infrastructure. Decision-making analysis, solution simulation, and customized planning capabilities can be provided for various digital twin geographical scenarios (such as digital twin cities, digital twin river basins, and digital twin water conservancies) by integrating geographical analysis models. This integration drives advancements in digital twins, metaverses, and digital human technology, spanning visual experiences, operation, and maintenance management. It also incorporates geographical knowledge, enhances interactive functions, and promotes a comprehensive understanding. © 2024 Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding electrical energy consumption of machines and processes is of increasing importance to (i) minimise costs and environmental impact of production activities and (ii) provide an additional information stream to inform condition monitoring systems (i.e. digital twins) about a machine's status and health. The research outlined in this paper develops a Virtual Machining Energy Toolkit (V_MET) to predict the electrical power consumption of a Computer Numeric Control (CNC) milling machine cutting a particular part program from preparatory codes (i.e. G code). In this way the evaluation of the energy impact of manufacturing part programs prior to implementation and real-time monitoring of the process can become a routine activity at part of a total manufacturing system optimisation. The novelty of this work lies in the inclusion of a virtual CNC process model to determine cutting geometry (i.e. width and depth of cut) to enable the prediction of relatively complex part program geometry. V_MET consists of three components: (i) the NC interpreter to extract key parameters (e.g. spindle speed, feed rate, tool path) from G-code instructions, (ii) a virtual CNC process model to determine instantaneous cutting geometry (i.e. width and depth of cut) and the material removal from the resulting machining by simulating the motion of the tool path to predict the interaction between the tool tip and workpiece and (iii) an energy model to predict the electrical power consumption for a given set of conditions, developed using regression analysis of data collected under real manufacturing conditions. Validation of V_MET has been conducted by physical machining of different product features to evaluate the validity over a range of different cutting parameters, NC operations (i.e. linear, clockwise interpolations) and repasses over previously cut regions. Overall good accuracy has been observed for the predicted energy requirements as a function of the cutting regimes, with 4.3% error in total energy and Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) of 5.6% when compared with measurements taken during physical cutting trials. © 2023

AB  - Currently, process planning of complex aviation parts still depends on manual experiences and lacks the coordination between process design and machining. The above issues case the problems like unreliable setting of process plans, un-timely responsive adjustment of machining process, and difficult to control the geometric accuracy and physical performance indicators of complex aviation parts. To bridge the gap, the digital twin is introduced into process planning and a novel reference framework of digital twin process model (DTPM) is proposed. Accordingly, by fusing the on-site data, quality information and process knowledge, the construction methods of data space, virtual space, and knowledge space of DTPM are proposed. Then, the co-evolution mechanism of multiple spaces of DTPM driven by geometric errors and physical performance indexes during machining process is introduced, which realizes the linkage optimization of process design and machining. Finally, aviation thin-walled parts are taken as an example to develop a DTPM prototype. Its application examples show that DTPM could provide supports for aerospace manufacturing enterprises to innovate process planning methods and realize the linkage optimization of process design and machining. © 2024 Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society.

AB  - Wireless network emulators are being increasingly used for developing and evaluating new solutions for Next Generation (NextG) wireless networks. However, the reliability of the solutions tested on emulation platforms heavily depends on the precision of the emulation process, model design, and parameter settings. To address, obviate, or minimize the impact of errors of emulation models, in this work, we apply the concept of Digital Twin (DT) to large-scale wireless systems. Specifically, we demonstrate the use of Colosseum, the world's largest wireless network emulator with hardware-in-the-loop, as a DT for NextG experimental wireless research at scale. As proof of concept, we leverage the Channel emulation scenario generator and Sounder Toolchain (CaST) to create the DT of a publicly available over-the-air indoor testbed for sub-6 GHz research, namely, Arena. Then, we validate the Colosseum DT through experimental campaigns on emulated wireless environments, including scenarios concerning cellular networks and jamming of Wi-Fi nodes, on both the real and digital systems. Our experiments show that the DT is able to provide a faithful representation of the real-world setup, obtaining an average similarity of up to 0.987 in throughput and 0.982 in Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR).  © 2002-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Modelling and simulation is a powerful tool to support the development of novel flow cells such as electrolysers and flow batteries. Electrolytes employed in such cells often consist of aqueous solutions of highly concentrated solutes at elevated temperatures. Such conditions pose numerous challenges in conventional model parametrisation because of non-ideal behaviour of the electrolytes. The aim of this work is to study mass transport of electroactive species in highly-concentrated media. We selected the hydrogen–bromine flow battery posolyte, HBr (aq) and Br2, as an exemplary flow battery electrolyte and we leveraged chronoamperometric techniques involving ultramicroelectrodes to study diffusion and migration of bromide and bromine at high concentration and temperature. We successfully simulated the current densities of HBr/Br2 redox reactions in solutions up to 8 mol L–1 using advanced mass transport theory which agreed well with the results obtained with ultramicroelectrodes. While uncharged species transport (Br2) can be credibly modelled using conventional theories such as Fick's law, charged species (Br–) require special treatment as the diffusion coefficient vary with concentration up to 50 % with respect to the limiting value at infinite dilution. The transport of charged species without added supporting electrolyte occurs via both migration and diffusion and the contribution of migration current may be up to 50 % of the total current. At HBr concentration > 0.6 mol L–1 migration appears to be suppressed due to the “self-screening” effect of the electrolyte. Proper experimental electrolyte characterisation under operating conditions similar to the actual flow cell applications is indispensable to establish predictive models and digital twins of electrochemical devices. Straightforward transfer of concepts known in electro-analytical chemistry to flow cells modelling may lead to erroneous simulations or model overfitting. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Human–robot collaboration, which strives to combine the best skills of humans and robots, has shown board application prospects in meeting safe–effective–flexible requirements in various fields. The ideation of much closer interaction between humans and robots has greatly developed the exploration of digital twin to enhance collaboration. By offering high-fidelity models and real-time physical–virtual interaction, the digital twin enables to achieve an accurate reflection of the physical scenario, including not only human–robot conditions but also environmental changes. However, the appearance of unpredictable events may cause an inconsistency between the established schedule and actual execution. To cope with this issue, an environment-adaptive assignment method based on digital twin for human–robot collaboration is formed in this study. The proposed approach consists of a factor–event–act mechanism that analyzes the dynamic events and their impacts from both internal and external perspectives of digital twin and a genetic algorithm–based assignment algorithm to respond to them. Experiments are carried out in the last part, aiming to show the feasibility of the proposed method. Copyright © 2023 by ASME.

AB  - In Warehouse Logistics (WL), the growing adoption of Industry 4.0 automations coupled with the demand for efficient and almost instantly responsive decision-making has already created a paradigm shift from the traditional Discrete Event Simulation (DES) models into innovative new ones utilizing the inherent functionalities of ‘Digital Twins’ (DTs), one of today’s most disruptive Industry 4.0 technologies. DTs are ‘real-world aware’ through the creation of exact software replicas of actual systems, allowing the convergence of physical and virtual entities and facilitating real-time responsive decision-making. In this paper, a bibliometric and content analysis-based systematic literature review is performed to explore the adoption, implementation and evaluation of DES and DTs in WL. The authors focus on how and to what extent these two methods are integrated into the various WL theoretical and real-life applications to enhance a plethora of performance factors as well as look into their exploitation, as standalone solutions or in tandem with one another and other modelling and simulation approaches, technologies, algorithms, methods, methodologies and strategies in different contexts and environments. Based on the review results, a conceptual framework is proposed combining the multiple perspectives examined, contributing to the systematization and standardization of the field and pinpointing future research directions. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - One of the main problems of modern manufacturing systems is the increasing complexity related to modern Industry 4.0 technologies that are fundamentally changing manufacturing and logistics processes and operations. Industry 4.0 includes, e.g., flexible automation and robotization, which make complex manufacturing systems difficult to analyze. Some modeling and simulation methods are being used to solve industrial problems and can serve as an interface between the production level and management level. The new trend of the Digital Twin, creating simulation models as similar as possible to the real system, and a Digital Twin framework for a manufacturing line from the automotive industry, was considered. Simulation models typically start from the empty state and some warmup time is required to achieve the stable state. The Key Performance Indicators were also analyzed for the stable state. However, there are many stochastic parameters such as machinery failures, human errors, quality issues, etc., that make the real processes differ from simulated processes, and cause the instability of production throughput and changes in the Work in Process. To analyze the Work in Process in the model, initialization of the model with proper production data is required, as the Digital Twin uses data synchronization with the production database. In this paper, the digital model of a human-robot-operated manufacturing system with Work-in-Process data synchronization is analyzed, and the results of the statistical analysis of simulation experiments are presented. The obtained results show high variability of finished production, which is related to system instability due to random failures, especially when the system starts from an empty state. However, an increase in initial Work in Process results in better efficiency and stability for the whole system. The DT simulation of the manufacturing system can be very helpful, as it becomes a repository of knowledge about the real system and enables the analysis of its dynamics. However, for proper functionality, the model should include information about the current WIP state, which enables the start of the simulation with exactly the same number of queues as in the real system. The presented method can also be used in similar enterprises from other industries, especially for those with discrete processes or high WIP variability, and for further synchronization of other DT parameters. © 2023 by the author.

AB  - Modeling and simulations, coupled with selected experimental studies for validation, are employed to analyze electrolyte impregnation in battery fabrication, elucidate and assess its effects on battery operation. Digital twins of the electrolyte filling process or the cell cycling are based on continuum-level physicochemical models taking into account the pore size distribution of the porous cathode and separator, dissolution and precipitation of any solutes such as sulfur or sulfides; additionally, ion transport and redox reactions in the liquid electrolyte for simulations of battery cycling. Electrolyte impregnation highly depends on cell format, with a cylindrical Li-ion cell predicted to take up to 7 days under rest for homogeneous electrolyte distribution. Simulations of the electrolyte infiltration in Li−S coin cells revealed sulfur dissolution and reprecipitation, which was verified by experiments using in operando microscopy. Simulations of the first discharge of electrolyte-lean Li−S cells demonstrated the effects of poor micropore wetting by the electrolyte. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The human geographic environment is a comprehensive environment formed by the interaction of human activities and the geographic environment, which is complex and highly vulnerable. Introducing the digital twin method to build a new framework of research on human geography issues has great disciplinary importance and application value because this framework has the characteristics of driving the virtual according to the real, controlling the real according to the virtual, and the coordinated evolution of the virtual and the real. It also helps avoid disturbing the real environment, explores complex problems in depth, and optimizes the control scheme of real geographical problems. Based on the review of relative research in China and abroad, a conceptual model of the digital twin human geographic environment is proposed, and its systematic connotation is elaborated. The major components of this system include the real human geographic environment, the virtual human geographic environment, and the information interaction between them. Through the digital twin construction and simulation of the geographic environment, human activities as well as human-nature interaction, the virtual and real synergy, complementary advantages, and coevolution between the virtual and the real environment can be realized. Furthermore, a technical framework with bilateral technology roadmap for the implementation of digital twin human geographic environments is proposed. One route is to complete the comprehensive perception and twin reproduction of the real human geographic environment through digital accurate mapping to the virtual geography environment, and the other route is to achieve intelligent feedback of the virtual human geographic environment and its manipulation on the real human geographic environment through multichannel virtual-real interaction. On the basis of the above, a hierarchical construction scheme of the digital twin human geographic environment platform, which covers five sub platforms, namely, collaborative monitoring and environmental awareness platform, multimodal full-scale database, intelligent modeling and simulation technology integration, high-performance spatiotemporal computing engine, and cross-domain knowledge application for decision making is designed. Supported by the Nanchang Subcenter of the UNESCO International Natural and Cultural Heritage Space Technology Center, the digital twin of Jiangxi Bailudong Academy, the education base of Chinese Confucian culture, is taken as a typical case to demonstrate the construction method, main function, and result form of the digital twin human geographic environment. The conclusions are drawn from three perspectives: (1) The digital twin human geographic environment should be taken as a creative method for the exploratory learning of human geography. (2) The digital twin human geographic environment is currently the best way to build a geographic metaverse with human activities. (3) The virtual geographic environment can provide theoretical basis for the construction of the digital twin human geographic environment. Lastly, the purpose of this paper is to throw bricks and spark jade to arouse scholars’ thinking on the research of coupling digital twins and human geographic environment, and to promote the sustainable development of human geography jointly. © 2024 Science Press.

AB  - The Metaverse refers to the integration of physical and virtual realities, offering new possibilities for enhancing operations and services across various industries. However, its application in the energy sector is still in its nascent stage. The energy industry, crucial for the global economy and society, faces significant challenges due to its complex and risky nature, such as health, safety, and environmental (HSE) concerns, and the remote locations of extraction sites. Although some studies have explored the use of the Metaverse in this industry for data visualization, energy process modeling, and training, a comprehensive review of existing technologies and applications is lacking. This article addresses this gap by examining the potential of the Metaverse for the energy industry, using the Oil&Gas sector as a case study. We identify the essential technologies needed to create a realistic and immersive Metaverse experience and review the current literature on its industrial applications in the energy sector. Distinguishing our work from others, we present four practical case studies developed from our own experience in the Oil&Gas sector. These cases demonstrate the tangible benefits of Metaverse solutions in improving operational efficiency, reducing costs, and enhancing worker safety and productivity, highlighting the unique value of the Metaverse in addressing industry-specific challenges. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - This work aims to analyze malicious communication behaviors that pose a threat to the security of digital twins (DTs) and safeguard user privacy. A unified and integrated multidimensional DTs Network (DTN) architecture is constructed. On this basis, the propagation process model of malware in the network is built to analyze the malicious propagation behavior that threatens network security. This model ensures the protection of mobile distributed machine learning system security. Blockchain technology is a distributed data protection mechanism with broad prospects. It is characterized by decentralization, transparency, and anonymity, which can help ensure secure network data sharing and privacy protection. Based on this, this work designs a secure distributed data sharing (DDS) architecture based on blockchain to improve the security and reliability of data protection with the support of the Internet of Things (IoT). Then, digital resource allocation based on semi-distributed learning is examined to propose a broad learning federated continuous learning (BL-FCL) algorithm combining blockchain and DTs. This algorithm significantly speeds up the model training process. Broad learning technology supports incremental learning. In this way, each client does not need to retrain when learning the newly generated data. In the experimental part, the prediction accuracy of BL-FCL on the mixed national institute of standards and technology data set is similar to that of the FedAvg-50 and FedAvg-80 schemes. As the number of devices increases from 1 to 6, the detection probability exhibits a rapid decrease. However, as the number of devices further increases from 6 to 10, the detection probability gradually decreases at a slower rate until it reaches 0. Comparatively, the prediction accuracy of the BL-FCL outperforms the federated averaging algorithm-based scheme by 20%-60%. The BL-FCL reported here can deal with the problem of inaccurate training while ensuring the privacy and security of users. This work is of great significance for ensuring the security of the DTN and promoting the development of the digital economy. The results can provide references for applying blockchain and distributed learning in the DT field.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Integrating technology and data throughout value chains is critical for achieving efficiency. Smart technologies that enable innovation and continuous improvement are key to long-term success. Modelling and simulation of business processes help to better understand existing systems and optimize processes. However, current approaches to digital transformation tend to focus solely on outcomes rather than the strategic methodology needed for successful implementation, resulting in differing valuations of solutions investments. This paper's significant contribution is introducing a new conceptual implementation method for digital twin technology in supply chain processes. This methodology enables technology and system evaluation at the process study stage, and a stylized business case demonstrates its application in a real-world scenario involving digital twin integration into order fulfilment in a manufacturing factory using Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) to simulate "As-Is" and "To-Be" processes. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - In this work, a classless oversampling technique, COVERT, was developed to improve historical datasets from industrial processing plants to aid process modelling. Using kernel density estimation and nearest neighbour algorithms, sparse regions are identified and resampled, developing a more balanced dataset. When applied to a real dataset from a geothermal power plant, COVERT outperforms current best practice (SMOTE) in uniformly populating the input feature space and generating credible data in the output variable. When used to develop a data-driven model COVERT improved model accuracy by 20% when predicting outside the original data's feature space. SMOTE, however, reduced model accuracy by 6% in the same feature space. Developing reliable models of industrial processes continues to be a significant hurdle in developing a digital twin. Using COVERT, existing imbalanced historical data can be used to extend the range of applicability of any process model. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - On-site batteries, low-pressure biogas storage, and wastewater storage could position wastewater resource recovery facilities as a widespread source of industrial energy demand flexibility. This work introduces a digital twin method that simulates the coordinated operation of current and future energy flexibility resources. We combine process models and statistical learning on 15 min resolution sensor data to construct a facility’s energy and water flows. We then value energy flexibility interventions and use an iterative search algorithm to optimize energy flexibility upgrades. Results from a California facility with anaerobic sludge digestion and biogas cogeneration predict a 17% reduction in electricity bills and an annualized 3% return on investment. A national analysis suggests substantial benefit from using existing flexibility resources, such as wet-weather storage, to reduce electricity bills but finds that new energy flexibility investments are much less profitable in electricity markets without time-of-use incentives and plants without existing cogeneration facilities. Profitability of a range of energy flexibility interventions may increase as a larger number of utilities place a premium on energy flexibility, and cogeneration is more widely adopted. Our findings suggest that policies are needed to incentivize the sector’s energy flexibility and provide subsidized lending to finance it. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The development of digital twins as a new technology aligns with the main strategic objectives of some of the world's top manufacturing countries. Several studies on digital twin cities have been performed, including the interaction of the Internet of Things (IoT) with smart cities, smart city traffic disaster risk management, and smart road inspection. The purpose of the research is to offer a survey of digital twin cities that includes road damage inspection as support for smart roads. The deployment of IoT technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to construct road defect detection systems on edge devices. This is the most recent breakthrough and an open challenge to creating a road defect detection system using edge AI on digital twins. As a result, edge AI devices are required to perform automatic and real-time road inspections. However, edge AI devices for detecting road damage have limited computing and storage capacities. Much of the physical system modeling has been completed in the construction of digital twin cities for road damage detection. In order to deploy CNN models on devices, some require physical system development. The stages involved in the development and implementation of a CNN model for an edge AI device road damage detection system are hardware selection, software development, developing the road damage detection application, edge device optimization, security and connectivity, testing and validation, and deployment. To improve system performance and reduce inference time, the CNN model must be optimized before being deployed on edge devices as edge AI. Copyright © 2024, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - The ability to non-uniformly weight the input space is desirable for many applications, and has been explored for space-filling approaches. Increased interests in linking models, such as in a digital twinning framework, increases the need for sampling emulators where they are most likely to be evaluated. In particular, we apply non-uniform sampling methods for the construction of aerodynamic databases. This paper combines non-uniform weighting with active learning for Gaussian Processes (GPs) to develop a closed-form solution to a non-uniform active learning criterion. We accomplish this by utilizing a kernel density estimator as the weight function. We demonstrate the need and efficacy of this approach with an atmospheric entry example that accounts for both model uncertainty as well as the practical state space of the vehicle, as determined by forward modeling within the active learning loop. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Modeling and simulation (M&S), including in silico (clinical) trials, helps accelerate drug research and development and reduce costs and have coined the term "model-informed drug development (MIDD)." Data-driven, inferential approaches are now becoming increasingly complemented by emerging complex physiologically and knowledge-based disease (and drug) models, but differ in setup, bottlenecks, data requirements, and applications (also reminiscent of the different scientific communities they arose from). At the same time, and within the MIDD landscape, regulators and drug developers start to embrace in silico trials as a potential tool to refine, reduce, and ultimately replace clinical trials. Effectively, silos between the historically distinct modeling approaches start to break down. Widespread adoption of in silico trials still needs more collaboration between different stakeholders and established precedence use cases in key applications, which is currently impeded by a shattered collection of tools and practices. In order to address these key challenges, efforts to establish best practice workflows need to be undertaken and new collaborative M&S tools devised, and an attempt to provide a coherent set of solutions is provided in this chapter. First, a dedicated workflow for in silico clinical trial (development) life cycle is provided, which takes up general ideas from the systems biology and quantitative systems pharmacology space and which implements specific steps toward regulatory qualification. Then, key characteristics of an in silico trial software platform implementation are given on the example of jinkō.ai (nova's end-to-end in silico clinical trial platform). Considering these enabling scientific and technological advances, future applications of in silico trials to refine, reduce, and replace clinical research are indicated, ranging from synthetic control strategies and digital twins, which overall shows promise to begin a new era of more efficient drug development. © 2024.

AB  - Intelligent construction is a necessary way to improve the traditional construction method, and digital twin can be a crucial technology to promote intelligent construction. However, the construction field currently needs a unified method to build a standardized and universally applicable digital twin model, which is incredibly challenging in construction. Therefore, this paper proposes a general method to construct a digital twin construction process model based on the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard, aiming to realize real-time monitoring, control, and visualization management of the construction site. The method constructs a digital twin fusion model from three levels: geometric model, resource model, and behavioral model by establishing an IFC semantic model of the construction process, storing the fusion model data and the construction site data into a database, and completing the dynamic interaction of the twin data in the database. At the same time, the digital twin platform is developed to realize the visualization and control of the construction site. Combined with practical cases and analysis, the implementation effect of the method is shown and verified. The results show that the method can adapt itself to different scenarios on the construction site, which is conducive to promoting application of the digital twin in the field of construction and provides a reference to the research of practicing digital twin theory and practice.

AB  - Low-frequency electromagnetic field simulation is the fundamental and key technology for the artificial intelligence of electrical equipment. Based on the development history of computational electromagnetics since the 1960s, this paper discusses the state of art of several key issues in low-frequency electromagnetic field simulation and looks forward to the current development trend in the field of numerical simulation. Firstly, the basic equations and numerical discretization methods of low-frequency electromagnetic field calculation are introduced. Secondly, the issues including homogenization, anisotropy and hysteresis model in material modelling are analyzed and discussed. Subsequently, the special characteristics of mesh and discrete format in low-frequency electromagnetic field simulation are explained from several aspects, such as multi-scale problem, skin effect, open boundary as well as deformation and motion; the current development trends of electromagnetic-thermal-structural multi-physics coupling are then analyzed; physical model-based and data-driven modelling approaches as well as recent work in digital twin model building are introduced. Finally, the development trend of numerical simulation in optimal design, digital twin, artificial intelligence and new generation of simulation software is analyzed and discussed. At present, multi-scale and multi-physics coupled modeling and simulation is still a focus of research in the field of electromagnetic field computation. The integration of the traditional numerical simulation with emerging computing technologies and artificial intelligence is becoming more and more significant. Under the cutting-edge needs of smart manufacturing and digital twins, electromagnetic field computation faces the challenges of efficient iterative simulation and real-time simulation. Physics and data-driven based surrogate modeling is a key technology to resolve the two issues. Industrial CAE simulation software architecture is undergoing a profound change, there is an urgent need to enhance the core technology and application ecology of China's self-developed CAE simulation software. © 2024 Science Press.

AB  - Researchers are exploring methods that exploit digital twins as all-purpose abstractions for sophisticated modelling and simulation, bringing elements of the real world into the virtual realm. Digital twins are essential elements of the digital transformation of society, which mostly benefit manufacturing, smart cities, healthcare contexts, and in general systems that include humans in the loop. As the metaverse concept continues to evolve, the line separating the virtual and the real will progressively fade away. Considering the metaverse’s goal to emulate our social reality, it becomes essential to examine the aspects that characterise real-world interaction practices and explicitly model both physical and social contexts. While the unfolding metaverse may reshape these practices in distinct ways from their real-world counterparts, our position is that it is essential to incorporate social theories into the modelling processes of digital twins within the metaverse. In this work, we discuss our perspective by introducing a digital practice model inspired by the theory of social practice. We illustrate this model by exploiting the scenario of a virtual grocery shop designed to help older adults reduce their social isolation. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Adapting the Digital Twin concept, initially conceived within the aerospace industry, to the realm of landscape poses a big challenge. This difficulty stems from the unique intrinsic characteristics of landscapes, primarily composed of organic elements and materials. In order to shed light on the viability of such an adaptation, this paper undertakes an examination of three instances wherein the Digital Twin concept has been successfully incorporated into the healthcare industry. These instances include the creation of virtual patients through advanced imaging, the application of simulation in sur-gical practice, and the integration of precision medicine. Through a comparative analysis of these cases, this paper explains how the landscape discipline could emulate the adoption and framework of the Digital Twin concept, thereby enhancing current landscape practices. © Wichmann Verlag, VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach.

AB  - Focusing on the problem of strip shape quality control in the finishing process of hot rolling, a shape model based on metal flow and stress release with the application of varying contact rolling parameters is introduced. Combined with digital twin technology, the digital twin framework of the shape model is proposed, which realizes the deep integration between physical time–space and virtual time–space. With the utilization of the historical data, the parameters are optimized iteratively to complete the digital twin of the shape model. According to the schedule, the raw material information is taken as the input to obtain the simulation of the strip shape, which shows a variety of export shape conditions. The prediction absolute error of the crown and flatness are less than 5 μm and 5 I-unit, respectively. The results prove that the proposed shape simulation model with strong prediction performance can be effectively applied to hot rolling production. In addition, the proposed model provides operators with a reference for the parameter settings for actual production and promotes the intelligent application of a shape control strategy. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Digital twins of the semiconductor fabrication process provide means for optimization of the physical layout and nanofabrication process design, studying compatibility between desired structures and a process flow, and a pathway to analyze the root causes of defects for state-of-the-art CMOS and MEMS devices. In this paper, a metric for the geometric differences between structures visualized by CD-SEM images is defined, and a computer-vision-based algorithm is developed to evaluate the metric. One of the major uses of such metrics is to compare experimental and simulated images. For this application, numerical results are presented when the simulator is SEMulator3D®, a physics-based process modeling software system for semiconductor and MEMS devices. Computer vision tools, such as filters, thresholding, and morphology operations, are used to extract geometric features from CD-SEM images and pattern matching and symmetric difference are used to compute the metric. Examples of using the metrics to quantify the geometric similarity between a simulated nanostructure and an experimental CD-SEM image of the fabricated nanostructure are presented. The data consists of eight classes of nanostructures which are defined, fabricated in the cleanroom with 36 combinations of layout parameters, and imaged with a CD-SEM.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The preservation of historical structures and infrastructures requires a multidisciplinary approach, based on preventive and planned conservation actions. For such a purpose, digital technologies are increasingly used to adaptively model and verify the behavior and stability of heritage assets. However, the reliability of model outputs depends on the accuracy on input data, which, in turn, depends on an appropriate choice of sensors, based on their technical characteristics. This is why an accurate design of monitoring system is crucial. Considering the installation and operation costs for a tailored system, it would be better to understand in advance the expected dynamic response of the structure or infrastructure to fit the monitoring system characteristics to the monitored structure . This is why, this work applies the use of FEM-based simulations to provide preliminary indications on the expected dynamic behavior of a heritage asset, supporting the identification of metrological parameters, in terms of sensors positioning and signals expected features. The used FEM, referred to a prototype of a Doric column, being the scaled 1:5 copy of a marble colonnade of the Temple of Apollo at Bassae (Greece), was designed, reproducing the parameterization (i.e., shape, measures, materials, etc.) of a previous FEM model, implemented and validated on the basis of experimental tests performed at the National Technical University of Athens. The results shed light on optimal sensor positioning and expected signal amplitudes, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in crafting tailored monitoring solutions for preventive conservation. The study underscores the importance of integrating Finite Element Modeling (FEM), avoiding the usual initial parallelization of model design and its experimental validation, into the creation of 'phygital' systems, that blend physical monitoring with digital twins. This approach not only enhances the accuracy of conservation efforts, but also suggests a promising direction for future research aimed at applying this methodology across a diverse range of heritage structures to support proactive preservation strategies. © 2024 International Measurement Confederation (IMEKO).

AB  - Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks, such as SpaceX's Starlink, offer enhanced communication potential for contemporary power grid measurement and control. Yet, the dynamic nature of these networks complicates their modeling and simulation. This study introduces a modular, data-oriented digital twin framework for real-time simulation of wide-area ac-dc grids with LEO satellite networks. The framework integrates RustSat for satellite tracking, SatSDN with MiniNet for SDN simulations, and entity-component-system (ECS)-Grid for real-time power system simulation. It features a data-centric design using an ECS framework with a structure-of-arrays memory layout, optimizing cache efficiency and computational performance, and offers high extensibility for interdisciplinary simulations. This marks the initial effort to develop a digital twin for real-time co-simulation of large-scale power systems and LEO satellite constellation networks. Evaluations on a wide-area synthetic ac-dc system with multiple satellite network types confirm the efficiency and precision of our approach, underscoring its potential in bridging LEO satellite networks with power system applications. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Dynamic evolution is the most typical feature of a digital twin, making it different from a traditional digital model. Dynamic evolution is also the core technology for building equipment digital twins because it ensures consistency between physical space and virtual space. This paper proposes a dynamic evolution framework for black box equipment digital twins. The framework consists of three main parts: data acquisition and processing, an evolution triggering mechanism and an evolution algorithm. A formal description of the dynamic evolution of a black box digital twin is also given. Furthermore, by synthetically considering the computational accuracy and efficiency, we design an incremental external attention temporal convolution network (IExATCN) model to instantiate the proposed framework. Finally, the significance of digital twin dynamic evolution and the effectiveness of the IExATCN is verified by 3D equipment attitude estimation datasets. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Digital transformation for the water sector has gained momentum in recent years, and many water resource recovery facilities modelers have already started transitioning from developing traditional models to digital twin (DT) applications. DTs simulate the operation of treatment plants in near real time and provide a powerful tool to the operators and process engineers for real-time scenario analysis and calamity mitigation, online process optimization, predictive maintenance, model-based control, and so forth. So far, only a few mature examples of full-scale DT implementations can be found in the literature, which only address some of the key requirements of a DT. This paper presents the development of a full-scale operational DT for the Eindhoven water resource recovery facility in The Netherlands, which includes a fully automated data-pipeline combined with a detailed mechanistic full-plant process model and a user interface co-created with the plant's operators. The automated data preprocessing pipeline provides continuous access to validated data, an influent generator provides dynamic predictions of influent composition data and allows forecasting 48 h into the future, and an advanced compartmental model of the aeration and anoxic bioreactors ensures high predictive power. The DT runs near real-time simulations every 2 h. Visualization and interaction with the DT is facilitated by the cloud-based TwinPlant technology, which was developed in close interaction with the plant's operators. A set of predefined handles are made available, allowing users to simulate hypothetical scenarios such as process and equipment failures and changes in controller settings. The combination of the advanced data pipeline and process model development used in the Eindhoven DT and the active involvement of the operators/process engineers/managers in the development process makes the twin a valuable asset for decision making with long-term reliability. Practitioner Points: A full-scale digital twin (DT) has been developed for the Eindhoven WRRF. The Eindhoven DT includes an automated continuous data preprocessing and reconciliation pipeline. A full-plant mechanistic compartmental process model of the plant has been developed based on hydrodynamic studies. The interactive user interface of the Eindhoven DT allows operators to perform what-if scenarios on various operational settings and process inputs. Plant operators were actively involved in the DT development process to make a reliable and relevant tool with the expected added value. © 2024 Water Environment Federation.

AB  - Under the background of dual-carbon national strategy and the widespread application of new-generation information technologies, systematization, precision, and intellectualization are the important development directions for the governance of mine ecological environment. Informatization of the governance of mine ecological environment in China has been carried out in a relatively rich and long-term way, but there are still problems such as lack of comprehensive monitoring system, inaccurate modeling of ecological evolution, ecological governance relying on expert experience, and no decision-making tools on informatization. Accordingly, in this study, the digital twin of mine ecological environment (DTME) is proposed, and its general framework, functional features and key technologies for system construction are introduced. The DTME is formally defined as a twin system of the physical mine ecosystem in virtual space by mapping three aspects: ecological elements, evolutionary processes, and impact mechanisms. The DTME utilizes spaceborne, airborne, and ground multi-source monitoring devices to dynamically detect the changes of ecological elements in the mine area, and constructs the complex driving models of the ecological evolution based on the artificial intelligence. The DTME supports the whole process of the scientific governance of mine ecological environment through program optimization or feedback control. Furthermore, the general framework of the DTME is introduced, including physical mine ecological environment (physical entity), monitoring terminal, twin data, information link, cloud-edge-terminal service, virtual mine ecological environment (virtual entity), and control terminal. Guided by real-life application requirements, the DTME can achieve mine ecological quality dynamic monitoring and health examination, mine ecological evolution simulation and impact factor analysis, prediction of mine ecological changes, mine ecological risk warning, intelligent grading and zoning of ecological restoration, mine ecological restoration effect evaluation, and mine ecological environment supervision. Finally, it is illustrated that the construction of the digital twin system of mine ecological environment involves four key technologies: digital base of mine ecosystem, digital scene of mine ecosystem, simulation and prediction of mine ecological evolution, and intelligent decision of mine ecological governance. The application of DTME can support the sensing, representation, monitoring, simulation, emulation, prediction, and control of the whole governance process of mine ecological environment, which is promising to significantly improve the quality and efficiency of governance. © 2023 China Coal Society.

AB  - Sorting plants are crucial for effective recycling, but their optimization can be challenging due to the heterogeneity of waste streams. We introduce a novel approach to holistically optimize sorting plants using digital twins containing data-driven process models. To demonstrate their technical feasibility, we developed a data-driven process model for industrial-scale sensor-based sorting (SBS) units by combining near-infrared process monitoring with machine learning. Our results indicate a sorting performance change (F1-score) in the SBS unit by 0.22 a% for +1% occupation density and +0.19 a% for +1 wt% target material share. An artificial neural network predicted the SBS behavior with a 3.0% mean absolute error. Our case study demonstrates the potential of data-driven process models for digital twins by clarifying the influence of throughput fluctuations on SBS performance and simulating different SBS cascade designs, thus paving the way towards improved design and operation of sorting plants and a more circular future. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - An up-and-coming concept that seeks to transform how students learn about and study complex systems, as well as how industrial workers are trained, metaverse technology is characterized in this context by its use in virtual simulation and analysis. In this work, a virtual environment is created that duplicates real-world situations and enables immersive and interactive learning in the educational metaverse. For this purpose, we built a digital twin of the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) campus as a foundation, called NTUniverse. It is designed as an educational metaverse in which various academic and analytical applications are digitized as 3D content embedded within this virtual campus. The approach to digitally twinning educational systems and embedding them within virtual campuses enables remote and collaborative learning as well as professional technical skills training. It also makes feasible the analysis of abstract concepts, complicated structures, dynamic processes, and sensitive industrial procedures virtually, which is otherwise challenging if not impossible to perform in the real world. The work offers important insights into the behaviors and interactions of systems in the metaverse by evaluating design choices and user interests. NTUniverse is an attempt to explore a novel approach that addresses remote education and training challenges. Three efforts with NTUniverse will be discussed in this work, including (1) digitalization of the NTU campus; (2) campus train modelling and simulation; and (3) science, technology, engineering and mathematics education. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Human-robot collaboration (HRC) in assembly is becoming increasingly popular in the field of intelligent manufacturing. However, safety concerns remain the most critical issue to be addressed. The complex assembly environment and the individual differences of workers make it challenging to ensure safety effectively. Furthermore, the concept of human-centric manufacturing also places higher requirements on safety and efficiency of HRC assembly. The application of digital twin (DT) technology has bolstered the cognitive and decision-making capabilities in the context of HRC assembly. This technological advancement provides essential support for addressing safety concerns in HRC assembly processes guided by a human-centric approach. A personalised safety detection method for HRC assembly based on DT technology is proposed. This approach involves personalised modelling and simulation of real objects within the HRC process, establishing a collision detection model based on skeleton points. Subsequently, human motion prediction methods drive safety monitoring between humans and robots. Ultimately, personalised safety warning strategies are applied to ensure the safety of the assembly process. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The introduction of Industry 4.0 and the Made in China 2025 development policy has accelerated the transformation of the manufacturing industry from automation to intelligence. Industrial robots, as the representative equipment of intelligent manufacturing, will also become more intelligent. Based on digital twin technology, digital modeling, and simulation debugging are conducted for such problems as interference and collision, tedious operation, and low efficiency of industrial robot spot welding debugging in production. Process Simulate from TECNOMATIX software is utilized to digitally model the robot spot welding station and define its motion, and TIA Portal and S7-PLCSIM Advanced are applied to build a virtual simulation and commissioning environment to realize multi-robot cooperative work at the processing station controlled by an external virtual PLC. The simulation results show that the robot can reach all working points during the motion and the joint speed is always kept within a reasonable range, which meets the requirements of safety and stability in the actual production process. At the same time, the robot spot welding station simulation by digital twin technology can find product defects in time, shorten the debugging cycle, and reduce the cost. © 2024 Acta Simulata Systematica Sinica.

AB  - At the European Space Agency (ESA), Modeling and Simulation (M&S) plays a fundamental role during the lifetime of a spacecraft, being used from the design phase to the testing and during operations in space. M&S tools embed general physics-based models and disciplines characterized by configurable parameters which have to be calibrated in order to mimic the behavior of the actual flying spacecraft. However, their calibration requires a large number of simulations which are unfeasible to be obtained through computationally expensive high-fidelity simulation models. Thus, the inability to calibrate the high-fidelity simulation models poses limitations for the use of M&S tools during spacecraft operations. In this light, the present work proposes the use of a surrogate model-based approach for the calibration of simulation models of spacecraft. The approach integrates a computationally inexpensive deep-learning-based surrogate model, which mimics the high-fidelity simulation model without requiring the same computational burden, and a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, to identify the optimal values of the simulation model configurable parameters. This enhances the capabilities of M&S tools and allows their use in operations. The approach's effectiveness is shown by its application to real flying Earth observation satellite data and simulation models. © 2023 COSPAR

AB  - The continuous casting process is a key technology for steel production today. More than 96% of all steel products worldwide are produced in this way. The development of a digital twin that allows offline and online optimization is more than necessary to improve process conditions and realize a robust final product quality. The approach of virtual experimentation described in this paper can be used to get quantitative and qualitative insights into robust process windows for given objectives and quality criteria. The impact of phenomena like convective flows and electromagnetic stirring on the product quality can be considered. An integrated stress calculation provides important information about residual stresses and improves the understanding of crack formation in the strand. The modeling of the gap formation helps to control the local heat transfer and is an essential input regarding the accuracy of the simulation. This concept of a digital twin for continuous casting processes using systematic virtual experimentation is the precondition for a comprehensive process model that can also be used for inline control of the process in daily production. © 2024 Verlag Stahleisen GmbH.

AB  - Modeling and simulation of feature scale profiles, including damage distributions and film properties in dry etching (continuous wave, pulse, cycle, and atomic layer etching) and deposition processes (chemical vapor, physical vapor, and atomic layer deposition) using string, shock tracking, level-set, and cell removable (or voxel) methods, are useful for predicting process properties and gain insights into the variation mechanisms for realizing high performance of advanced complementary metal-oxide semiconductor devices and have been comprehensively reviewed in this work. The future perspective has also been discussed from the viewpoint of a fusion physical model with machine learning using real-time monitoring of the manufacturing equipment, so-called process informatics. Furthermore, after the introduction of quantum computing for process simulations on atomic scales, the epoch of full digital twins might be realized.  © 2023 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

AB  - Even though the Covid-19 pandemic seems to be stagnating or decreasing across the world, a resurgence of the disease or the occurrence of other epidemics caused by the aerial dissemination of pathogenic biological agents cannot be ruled out. These agents, in particular the virions of the Covid-19 disease, are found in the particles originating from the sputum of infected symptomatic or asymptomatic people. In previous research, we made use of a three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model to simulate particle transport and dispersion in ventilated semi-confined spaces. By way of illustration, we considered a commuter train coach in which an infected passenger emitted droplets (1 and 10 µm) and drops (100 and 1000 µm) while breathing and coughing. Using an Eulerian approach and a Lagrangian approach, we modelled the dispersion of the particles in the turbulent flow generated by the ventilation of the coach. The simulations returned similar results from both approaches and clearly demonstrated the very distinct aerodynamics of the aerosol of airborne droplets and, at the other end of the spectrum, of drops falling or behaving like projectiles depending on their initial velocity. That numerical study considered passengers without protective masks. In this new phase of research, we first used literature data to develop a model of a typical surgical mask for use on a digital manikin representing a human. Next, we resumed the twin experiment of the railway coach, but this time, the passengers (including the infected one) were provided with surgical masks. We compared the spatial and temporal distributions of the particles depending on whether the spreader passenger wore a mask at all, and whether the mask was perfectly fitted (without leaks) or worn loosely (with leaks). Beyond demonstrating the obvious value of wearing a mask in limiting the dissemination of particles, our model and our simulations allow a quantification of the ratio of particles suspended in the coach depending on whether the infected passenger wears a mask or not. Moreover, the calculations carried out constitute only one illustrative application among many others, not only in public transport, but in any other public or private ventilated space on the basis of the same physical models and digital twins of the places considered. CFD therefore makes it possible to estimate the criticality of the occupation of places by people with or without a mask and to recommend measures in order to limit aerial contamination by any kind of airborne pathogen, such as the virions of Covid-19. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - In response to the urgent need to establish AI/ML-integrated Digital Twin (DT) technology within next-generation nuclear systems, advancements in modeling methods and simulation codes are necessary. The increased complexity of models demands significant computational resources to quantify their uncertainties. To address this challenge, a data-driven non-intrusive uncertainty quantification method via polynomial chaos expansion is introduced as an efficient strategy within the finite element analysis-based fuel performance code BISON. Models of UO2 and U3Si2 fuels, alongside SiC/SiC cladding material, were prepared to demonstrate the proposed method. The impact of four independent uncertain input variables on the system output was quantified, requiring fewer than 100 BISON simulations for each model. This approach not only accelerates the modeling and simulation task but also enhances the reliability in the development of DT-enabling technologies. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Poor design of composite electrodes in Solid-State Batteries (SSBs) is one of the main reasons for their low performance. Although modeling techniques offer great potential in investigating multiple conditions for microstructure optimization, SSB manufacturing remains almost unaddressed in terms of computational studies. We present here a three-dimensional physics-based modeling workflow to investigate the impact of wet manufacturing process parameters on the properties of SSB tape casted composite electrodes based on LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 as the active material and Li6PSCl5 sulfide solid electrolyte. Our proposed workflow models the entire process of wet manufacturing of SSB electrodes, starting with the slurry consisting of active material, carbon additive, binder, solid electrolyte and solvent, and continues through its drying process, and the calendering of the resulting electrodes. Our focus is in particular on the impact of the calendering degree on the microstructure of the electrode. We characterize the resulting microstructures in terms of electronic and ionic conduction properties. We believe that this first-of-its-kind wet manufacturing process model for SSB cathodes is an important step towards the development of systematic modeling approaches that can provide practical optimization of the interfaces between materials in electrodes to improve SSB performance and durability. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Nuclear power plants (NPPs) require continuous monitoring of various systems, structures, and components to ensure safe and efficient operations. The critical safety testing of new fuel compositions and the analysis of the effects of power transients on core temperatures can be achieved through modeling and simulations. They capture the dynamics of the physical phenomenon associated with failure modes and facilitate the creation of digital twins (DTs). Accurate reconstruction of fields of interest (e.g., temperature, pressure, velocity) from sensor measurements is crucial to establish a two-way communication between physical experiments and models. Sensor placement is highly constrained in most nuclear subsystems due to challenging operating conditions and inherent spatial limitations. This study develops optimized data-driven sensor placements for full-field reconstruction within reactor and steam generator subsystems of NPPs. Optimized constrained sensors reconstruct field of interest within a tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) fuel irradiation experiment, a lumped parameter model of a nuclear fuel test rod and a steam generator. The optimization procedure leverages reduced-order models of flow physics to provide a highly accurate full-field reconstruction of responses of interest, noise-induced uncertainty quantification and physically feasible sensor locations. Accurate sensor-based reconstructions establish a foundation for the digital twinning of subsystems, culminating in a comprehensive DT aggregate of an NPP. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Digital twins provide a powerful tool for testing and maintaining products and processes in several application fields, including manufacturing, smart cities, healthcare, and agriculture, aiming to optimize operational efficiency, resource usage, and planning accuracy. Research presented in this paper deals with the development of the digital version of off-road vehicles. Two different robot simulation frameworks are investigated. The first one is based on Gazebo, an open-source 3D robotics simulator, to test and validate the algorithms developed in the ROS framework; the second one adopts the vehicle mechanical assembly in MSC Adams, a multibody modeling software used to study the dynamics of complex mechanical systems. Both models are developed for a tracked robot that uses an innovative articulated passive suspension system on either side that allows each ground wheel to move independently with respect to the vehicle body, providing remarkable adaptability to irregular terrain. In addition, a Gazebo model is developed for a four-wheel drive/steering robot, including robot sensors such as GNSS, IMU, and visual sensors and a model of a typical agricultural environment (i.e., a vineyard). The paper presents the details of model design and implementation while investigating the best choice in developing the digital twin of off-road vehicles operating in the field. Additionally, an agricultural scenario has been selected as a use case to facilitate the evaluation of the analyzed frameworks. Our findings demonstrate that the Gazebo framework could serve as a suitable robot simulation framework for creating digital twins of vehicles, provided it incorporates real-time sensor measurements designed for identifying soil-wheel interaction dynamics. In contrast, the multibody model provides a higher-fidelity dynamic model, including track-terrain interaction. Despite its advantages, this model has substantially higher computational costs, which limits its applicability to real-time simulations, making it less feasible for practical use in the field. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The field of modeling and simulation including digital twins (DT) is getting a lot of traction in the health sector, with various benefits being outlined. Indeed, DT are designed to support the transformation of healthcare, ranging from the medical act itself to the organization of healthcare systems and hospitals, also including medical research. However, the technology is still in its infancy and needs to be evaluated according to medical standards. First and foremost, their clinical value remains to be assessed, taking into account the limits associated with AI tools. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the use cases being tested in hospital settings. We go back to the definition of the DT concept and provide a summary of current studies. Finally, we outline the challenges to be taken into account in order to provide a framework for the deployment of DT tools, guaranteeing the trust and safety of those involved, especially of patients. Vignette (© DR).; La recherche et développement en santé est très dynamique dans le champ de la simulation, et de nombreux projets se réclament du jumeau numérique (JN). Les JN sont voués à accompagner la transformation du soin, qu’il s’agisse de l’acte médical, du parcours de soins ou de leur organisation. Toutefois, cette technologie est naissante et nécessite d’être évaluée. L’objectif de cette synthèse est de dresser un état des lieux des cas d’usages du JN à l’hôpital. Nous revenons sur la définition du concept de JN et proposons un condensé des études en cours. Enfin, nous rappelons l’importance de créer un cadre propice au déploiement de ces outils, garantissant la confiance et la sécurité des acteurs et des patients. Vignette (© DR).

AB  - This paper introduces DMAIC-v2, an enhanced approach based on the Six Sigma Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC) methodology aimed at facilitating the improvement of industrial processes in a more efficient and effective manner. DMAIC-v2 expands upon the capabilities of the classic DMAIC to address a wider range of applications effectively and efficiently, including modern equipment and processes. This updated version introduces an innovative methodology for evaluating improvement options by leveraging modeling and simulation techniques. It also incorporates a real-time quality control model for optimizing the effectiveness of quality control in production processes and output products. Furthermore, it introduces an innovative approach for programming and controlling industrial processes using augmented reality, virtual reality, and digital twin technologies. To showcase the effectiveness of DMAIC-v2, this paper presents a case study focusing on the improvement of a twisting system for automotive cables. The case study demonstrates how DMAIC-v2 is effective in reducing variability, minimizing the waste of raw materials, and enhancing the characteristics of the product. This paper serves as a practical guide for improving industrial equipment and production processes to achieve higher-quality products. It provides a roadmap and effective methods for addressing challenges related to industrial processes, including equipment variability, lack of flexibility and smartness, budget constraints, waste of raw materials, and product quality. By following the recommendations presented in this paper, firms can overcome these challenges and enhance their overall performance. Copyright © 2024 by ASTM International.

AB  - Wind turbines (WT) are a clean renewable energy source that have gained popularity in recent years. Gearboxes are complex, expensive, and critical components of WT, which are subject to high maintenance costs and several stresses, including high loads and harsh environments, that can lead to failure with significant downtime and financial losses. This paper focuses on the development of a digital twin-based approach for the modelling and simulation of WT gearboxes with the aim to improve their design, diagnosis, operation, and maintenance by providing insights into their behavior under different operating conditions. Powerful commercial computer-aided design tools (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) software are embedded into a computationally efficient multi-objective optimization framework (modeFrontier) with the purpose of maximizing the power density, compactness, performance, and reliability of the WT gearbox. High-fidelity models are used to minimize the WT weight, volume, and maximum stresses and strains achieved without compromising its efficiency. The 3D CAD model of the WT gearbox is carried out using SolidWorks (version 2023 SP5.0), the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is used to obtain the stresses and strains, fields are modelled using Ansys Workbench (version 2024R1), while the multibody kinematic and dynamic system is analyzed using Adams Machinery (version 2023.3, Hexagon). The method has been successfully applied to different case studies to find the optimal design and analyze the performance of the WT gearboxes. The simulation results can be used to determine safety factors, predict fatigue life, identify potential failure modes, and extend service life and reliability, thereby ensuring proper operation over its lifetime and reducing maintenance costs. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - In spite of continuous medical and technological advances, there are still treatments today, e.g., infertility treatments, that have not been addressed using remote monitoring due to the absence of reliable devices and smart health monitoring systems (SHMSs). A recent European Union report highlights the need for scientific investment in remote monitoring efficiency. To expedite cost-effective real-data experiments, the scientific community emphasizes complementing SHMSs with modeling and simulation techniques, allowing the projection of comprehensive treatment scenarios and informed decision-making based on synthetic data. In this paper, we conducted simulations of patient flow in two assisted reproduction clinics, with real data, applying discrete event simulation techniques. Four simulation scenarios were run for the Alicante clinic: (i) current system organization, (ii) using SHMS with the same resources, (iii) SHMS with reduced clinical staff, and (iv) SHMS with modified staff allocation. In a large-scale clinic in Madrid, two scenarios were simulated: (i) current system organization and (ii) SHMS with the same resources. The simulation of different scenarios enabled (i) the identification of a bottleneck in an ultrasound scanning area in the current system's organization; (ii) modelling of the relocation of the clinical staff within the clinic; and (iii) a proposal of the most optimal scenario with SHMS. Comparing the obtained results, we showed a reduction in the workload of the receptionists, in the ultrasound and blood collection areas and finally reduced the workload of physicians with first half and the second half of the working day schedules in both clinics. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - For advanced aero-engine design and research, modeling and simulation in a digital environment is indispensable, especially for engines of complicated configurations, such as variable cycle engines (VCE) and adaptive cycle engines (ACE). Also, in the research of future smart engines, reliable real-time digital twins are paramount. However, the 2 dominant methods that used in solving the simulation models, Newton-Raphson (N-R) method and volume-based method, are not fully qualified for the study requirements, because neither of them reaches the satisfactory balance of convergence rate and calculating efficiency. In this study, by deeply analyzing the mathematical principle of these 2 methods, a novel modeling and solving method for aero-engine simulation, which integrates the advantages of both N-R and volume-based methods, is established. It has distributed architecture and local quadratic convergence rate. And a novel modeling method for variable area bypass injectors (VABI) is put forward. These facilitate simulation of various configurations of aero-engines. The modeling cases, including a high bypass-ratio (BPR) turbofan and an ACE, illustrate that the novel technique decreases the iterations by about two-thirds comparing with volume-based method, while the success rate of convergence remains over 99%. This proves its superiority in both convergence and calculating efficiency over the conventional ones. This technique can be used in advanced gas turbine engine design and control strategy optimization, and study of digital twins. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Digital Applications are complex software systems for decision support in process operations and for process control. Each such application involves one or more computational modules being executed in an arbitrary real-time schedule, and communicating with each other and the external environment within which they are deployed. Each module may involve a mathematical computation based on a process model derived from first-principles or via machine learning applied to plant data; alternatively, it may have a purely statistical basis derived directly from plant data. There has been much progress in the use of such digital applications in industrial practice. However, achieving true scalability and sustainability in this direction will require general platforms that will allow the essentially code-free development of new applications and their large-scale deployments. We describe one such, recently developed, platform. We also consider the potential role of digital applications in the context of major trends in process operations, such as autonomous plant operation and process plant modularization. © 2023

AB  - As the take-off of China’s macro economy, as well as the rapid development of infrastructure construction, real estate industry, and highway logistics transportation industry, the demand for heavy vehicles is increasing rapidly, the competition is becoming increasingly fierce, and the digital transformation of the production line is imminent. As one of the most important components of heavy vehicles, the transmission front and middle case assembly lines have a high degree of automation, which can be used as a pilot for the digital transformation of production. To ensure the visualization of digital twins (DT), consistent control logic, and real-time data interaction, this paper proposes an experimental digital twin modeling method for the transmission front and middle case assembly line. Firstly, the DT-based system architecture is designed, and the DT model is created by constructing the visualization model, logic model, and data model of the assembly line. Then, a simulation experiment is carried out in a virtual space to analyze the existing problems in the current assembly line. Eventually, some improvement strategies are proposed and the effectiveness is verified by a new simulation experiment. © 2024 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article systematically summarises the digital twin technology in the existing scientific field using the bibliometric method, puts forward the critical areas and research directions at different stages of the life cycle of the digital twin research topic. Using R-Studio ‘Biblioshiny’ to measure scientifically, we visually analyze 514 articles related to digital twin in the Web of Science's core set from 2014 to 2021 (including SCI-Expanded and SSCI database). Firstly, we analyzed the core journals, articles, authors, institutions, relevant countries to determine the vital influence of digital twin-related literature. Secondly, we use theme maps to draw the research topics of digital twin-related literature as icons on the conceptual structure and offer four cluster parts (Motor themes, highly developed and isolated themes, Emerging themes, and Basic themes). Finally, we concluded by summarising the limitations of our study and subsequently highlighted future research directions. The study shows that monitoring, maintenance, and computer vision are research topics with good development momentum. Disturbance observer, reinforcement learning, and friction are relatively small research topics with a good development foundation, and scheduling, process modelling, and deep reinforcement learning are emerging research directions. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - For the problem of long modeling time and large workload of multiview bill of material (XBOM) reconstruction process in digital twin shop, this paper proposes a knowledge-driven XBOM reconstruction method for complex products. Through the research of knowledge base construction, the modeling and simulation analysis of XBOM reconstruction process in digital twin workshop are supported, so as to shorten the cycle and improve efficiency and quality. Taking the maintenance history data of the typical representative electric multiple unit (EMU) bogies in complex products as the research object, the bidirectional long short-term memory neural network with conditional random field (BiLSTM-CRF) algorithm is used to complete the entity recognition of maintenance BOM (WBOM) reconstructed parts. Finally, taking the XBOM reconstruction process of the bogie of an enterprise as an example, the XBOM reconstruction knowledge base interaction system of the EMU bogie is built. It verifies the feasibility of the method proposed in this paper, and provides knowledge support for the XBOM reconstruction process of complex products in the digital twin workshop. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The growing relevance of artificial intelligence (AI) for technical systems offers significant potential for the realization and operation of autonomous systems in complex and potentially unknown environments. However, unlike classical solution approaches, the functionality of an AI system cannot be verified analytically, which is why data-driven approaches such as scenario-based testing are used. With the increasing complexity of the required functionality of the AI-based system, the quantity, and quality of the data needed for development and validation also increase. To meet this demand, data generated synthetically using simulation is increasingly being used. Compared to the acquisition of real-world reference data, simulation offers the major advantage that it can be configured to test specific scenarios of interest. This paper presents an architecture for the systematic generation of virtual test scenarios to establish synthetically generated test data as an integral part of the development and validation process for AI systems. Key aspects of this architecture are the consistent use of digital twins as virtual 1-to-1 replicas and a simulation infrastructure that enables the generation of training and validation data for AI-based systems in appropriate quantity, quality, and time. In particular, this paper focuses on the application of the architecture in the context of two use cases from different application domains. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The pressing challenge of mitigating carbon emissions towards achieving net-zero energy in smart cities, especially in the context of renewable energy integration, necessitates renewable energy integration in the smart energy management. This research focuses on harnessing renewable energy sources to curb emissions using advanced machine learning of Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Leveraging the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), an evolutionary algorithm, we tackled the complexities of smart city energy management and optimization. ACO, inspired by the collective behavior of ants, allowed us to navigate the intricate landscape of energy distribution, optimizing resources for maximum efficiency. Furthermore, this article develops Digital Twin technology as a practical solution for modeling and simulating smart city environments. By creating detailed digital replicas of urban systems, Digital Twin facilitated precise analysis and experimentation. Our study utilized these digital models as practical case studies, enabling us to simulate various scenarios and optimize energy usage effectively. The synergy of renewable energy integration, ACO-driven optimization, and Digital Twin modeling offers a holistic and intelligent approach to propel smart cities towards a sustainable, net-zero energy future. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Integration of digital twin (DT) and wireless channel provides new solution of channel modeling and simulation, and can assist to design, optimize and evaluate intelligent wireless communication system and networks. With DT channel modeling, the generated channel data can be closer to realistic channel measurements without requiring a prior channel model, and amount of channel data can be significantly increased. Artificial intelligence (AI) based modeling approach shows outstanding performance to solve such problems. In this work, a channel modeling method based on generative adversarial networks is proposed for DT channel, which can generate identical statistical distribution with measured channel. Model validation is conducted by comparing DT channel characteristics with measurements, and results show that DT channel leads to fairly good agreement with measured channel. Finally, a link-layer simulation is implemented based on DT channel. It is found that the proposed DT channel model can be well used to conduct link-layer simulation and its performance is comparable to using measurement data. The observations and results can facilitate the development of DT channel modeling and provide new thoughts for DT channel applications, as well as improving the performance and reliability of intelligent communication networking.  © 2013 China Institute of Communications.

AB  - Robotic friction stir welding has become an important research direction in friction stir welding technology. However, the low stiffness of serial industrial robots leads to substantial, difficult-to-measure end-effector deviations under the welding forces during the friction stir welding process, impacting the welding quality. To more effectively measure the deviations in the end-effector, this study introduces a digital twin model based on the five-dimensional digital twin theory. The model obtains the current data of the robot and six-axis force sensor and calculates the real-time end deviations using the robot model. Based on this, a virtual welding model was realized by integrating the FEA model with the digital twin model using a co-simulation approach. This model achieves pre-process simulation by iteratively cycling through the simulated force from the FEA model and the end displacement from the robot model. The virtual welding model effectively predicts the welding outcomes with a mere 6.9% error in lateral deviation compared to actual welding, demonstrating its potential in optimizing welding parameters and enhancing accuracy and quality. Employing digital twin models to monitor, simulate, and optimize the welding process can reduce risks, save costs, and improve efficiency, providing new perspectives for optimizing robotic friction stir welding processes. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Minimizing the effort associated with the pilot and laboratory-scale experiments needed for a successful scale-up of a process from laboratory to production scale is a significant challenge in process development. Efficient scale-up is becoming increasingly important in process development due to the growing pressure to reduce costs and timelines while achieving a first-time-right approach. This article describes innovative technologies that enable direct and efficient process scale-up from the laboratory to production scale, while concurrently optimizing scale-dependent parameters through in-depth process understanding. Those technologies include a dynamic process model (based on a digital twin) and a laboratory-scale imitation (Scale-Down-Reactor) of a specific production-scale reactor (4000 L). The core component of the Scale-Down-Reactor is a 3D-printed metallic insert (H/C-Finger), designed to replicate the heat transfer behavior of the production reactor by maintaining a similar heat transfer coefficient and surface-to-volume ratio. In order to maintain comparable gas-liquid mass transfer between the scales, the Scale-Down-Reactor was designed with geometric similarity to its large-scale counterpart. Both mass transfer and heat transfer were experimentally evaluated for the two scales, and the comparison demonstrated an excellent agreement. To finally prove and validate the concept, a hydrogenation process currently running at the production scale was conducted in the Scale-Down-Reactor. As a second technology, a dynamic process model is described that includes a kinetic model of the chemical reactions and a heat/mass transfer model (digital twin) of the aforementioned production-scale reactor. For the gas-liquid mass transfer model, an improved mathematical description (equation) was developed. Moreover, the production-scale hydrogenation process conditions were efficiently optimized using the dynamic process model. The measured reaction mixture temperature profile of the optimized production batch demonstrated excellent agreement with the profile predicted by the dynamic process model. By enabling direct and efficient process scale-up while concurrently optimizing scale-dependent parameters, the technologies described within this article offer a promising approach to reducing costs and timelines while improving process understanding. © 2023 American Chemical Society

AB  - Additive manufacturing (AM) has revolutionized the way we design, prototype, and produce complex parts with unprecedented geometries. However, the lack of understanding of the functional properties of 3D-printed parts has hindered their adoption in critical applications where reliability and durability are paramount. This paper proposes a novel approach to the functional qualification of 3D-printed parts via physical and digital twins. Physical twins are parts that are printed under the same process conditions as the functional parts and undergo a wide range of (destructive) tests to determine their mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. Digital twins are virtual replicas of the physical twins that are generated using finite element analysis (FEA) simulations based on the 3D shape of the part of interest. We propose a novel approach to transfer learning, specifically designed for the fusion of diverse, unstructured 3D shape data and process inputs from multiple sources. The proposed approach has demonstrated remarkable results in predicting the functional properties of 3D-printed lattice structures. From an engineering standpoint, this paper introduces a comprehensive and innovative methodology for the functional qualification of 3D-printed parts. By combining the strengths of physical and digital twins with transfer learning, our approach opens up possibilities for the widespread adoption of 3D printing in safety-critical applications. Methodologically, this work presents a significant advancement in transfer learning techniques, specifically addressing the challenges of multi-source (e.g., digital and physical twins) and multi-input (e.g., 3D shapes and process variables) transfer learning.

AB  - Dynamic crossflow filtration (DCF) is the state-of-the-art technology for solid–liquid separation from viscous and sensitive feed streams in the food and biopharma industry. Up to now, the potential of industrial processes is often not fully exploited, because fixed recipes are usually applied to run the processes. In order to take the varying properties of biological feed materials into account, we aim to develop a digital twin of an industrial brownfield DCF plant, allowing to optimize setpoint decisions in almost real time. The core of the digital twin is a mechanistic–empirical process model combining fundamental filtration laws with process expert knowledge. The effect of variation in the selected process and model parameters on plant productivity has been assessed using a model-based design-of-experiments approach, and a regression metamodel has been trained with the data. A cyclic program that bidirectionally communicates with the DCF asset serves as frame of the digital twin. It monitors the process dynamics membrane torque and transmembrane pressure and feeds back the optimum permeate flow rate setpoint to the physical asset in almost real-time during process runs. We considered a total of 24 industrial production batches from the filtration of grape juice from the years 2022 and 2023 in the study. After implementation of the digital twin on site, the campaign mean productivity increased by 15% over the course of the year 2023. The presented digital twin framework is a simple example how an industrial established process can be controlled by a hybrid model-based algorithm. With a digital process dynamics model at hand, the presented metamodel optimization approach can be easily transferred to other (bio)chemical processes. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Additive and subtractive (Add/Sub) manufacturing processes are increasingly being combined to produce complex parts with unique geometries and properties. However, the design of such combined processes is often challenging as it requires a deep understanding of the interaction between the different processes. On the other hand, digital twin (DT) technology has become a powerful tool in recent years for optimizing manufacturing processes. This article explores the use of the digital twin technology for a holistic process planning of combined additive and subtractive processes. The article describes the integration of laser metal deposition (LMD) and micro-milling prediction models of resulting geometry (width and height), hardness, and surface roughness into the digital twin. This is then used for combined process planning to achieve different target values regarding resulting geometry and surface roughness. For the planning of this combined process chain, further criteria such as tool life, energy, and process time are considered in the optimization, showing the potential for sustainable and efficient production. Sensorless cutting force estimation is also used to detect small cutting forces, with the potential to use this as a soft sensor for roughness estimation. The measured width, height, and roughness as a result of the process parameters suggested by the optimization algorithms showed a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 4, 17, and 16%, respectively. © 2024 by ASME.

AB  - Industrial manufacturing processes have evolved and improved since the disruption of the Industry 4.0 paradigm, while energy has progressively become a strategic resource required to maintain industrial competitiveness while maximizing quality and minimizing environmental impacts. In this context of global changes leading to social and economic impact in the short term and an unprecedented climate crisis, Digital Twins for Energy Efficiency in manufacturing processes provide companies with a tool to address this complex situation. Nevertheless, already existing Digital Twins applied for energy efficiency in a manufacturing process lack a flexible structure that easily replicates the real behavior of consuming machines while integrating it in complex upper-level environments. This paper presents a combined multi-paradigm approach to industrial process modeling developed and applied during the GENERTWIN project. The tool allows users to predict energy consumption and costs and, at the same time, evaluates the behavior of the process under certain productive changes to maximize consumption optimization, production efficiency and process flexibility. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This paper presents a method that utilizes graph theory and state modelling algorithms to perform automatic complexity analysis of the architecture of cyber-physical systems (CPS). It describes cyber physical systems risk assessment (CPSRA), a tool to provide automatic decision support for enhancing the overall resilience of CPS architectures often used in critical infrastructures. CPRSA is built to enhance industrial risk assessment and improve the resilience of CPS architecture against malicious attacks on the cyber domain that can affect industrial processes, which is critical in a distributed cyber environment. Such attacks often compromise execution states on physical components and lead to hazards or even disasters through plant malfunction. CPSRA is tested against a real-world testbed model of a large SCADA system that is infused with real-world CVE vulnerabilities in some of its components. The tool creates an isomorphic graph of the CPS process model and uses graph algorithms and network analytics on the model to test cyber-attacks and evaluate attack resilience aspects. The tool’s output is then used to pinpoint high-complexity components in terms of influence on the overall CPS architecture and suggest mitigation points for security measure implementation while considering every potential subattack path and subliminal path on the model’s attack graph. The paper complements standardized assessment reports and contributes to automatic architecture assessment for critical infrastructure environments and can be used as the basis to model dependencies and threat propagation in larger digital twins, a need outlined in major NIST publications concerning the security of industrial systems that was previously done manually, without automatic insight into state and vulnerability influences. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Flexible cooperative production workers are important for the performance and flexibility of the production cell. In this paper, a human–machine integrated hybrid modeling method is first proposed, which combines the discrete process model with the multi-agent model to simulate the collaborative behavior of workers in a discrete production process. Model structure, simulation process, and worker collaboration behaviors are illustrated in detail. An embedded framework of digital twins is established based on the simulation. Simulation experiments are then carried out on two changeover-based collaboration schemes in a variable-batch mixed-flow production cell under different production environment conditions, to obtain the dynamic and adaptive collaboration scheme. Both the performance indexes and the flexibility indexes of the production cell are evaluated, to achieve a quantitative evaluation of flexibility. The results show that the impact of workers’ behaviors on production performance differs for the various collaboration schemes and dynamic production environments. Autonomous collaboration scheme shows better performance only under high environmental fluctuation level, but has a higher flexibility considering all fluctuation levels. This study can help managers realize the best match between humans, machines and the environment by improving workers’ collaboration behaviors. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Efficient performance monitoring in production systems holds paramount importance as it enables organizations to optimize their manufacturing processes, enhance productivity, and maintain a competitive edge in the market. Typically, machine and system level performance monitoring systems are investigated independently, whereas an integrated approach that considers both levels can offer valuable insights and benefits. This paper introduces a data-driven approach for evaluating and improving the performance of production lines by monitoring the performance of both individual machines and their interactions as a system. The approach begins with a rigorous methodology for classifying machine states recorded by the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) into finer-grained substates, enabling a comprehensive analysis of machine cycle time variability. Subsequently, these substates are leveraged as a foundation for constructing performance monitoring models at both the machine and system levels, employing probabilistic automata for the machine level and logistic regression for the system level. The system-level performance monitoring model is constructed to predict a Flow metric that enables the prediction of abnormal behaviors and deviations from production targets. This data-driven approach serves as a foundational ingredient of a system-level digital twin, designed to provide production lines with insights that enable proactive implementation of measures aimed at optimizing overall manufacturing efficiency. Through an industrial test case from the automotive industry, the results demonstrate the capability of performance monitoring, capturing errors within confidence intervals, and establishing predictive cause-and-effect relationships between machines within the production system. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Digital twin, visually monitor the dynamic evolution process of part cutting in a digital way, which has attracted widespread attention in smart manufacturing. Under this background, creating a high fidelity and evolvable virtual model has become the key to putting digital twin into practice in the manufacturing field. However, the 3D process model pays scant attention on the dynamically machining process, multi-dimensional evolutionary machining feature, and not even the coupling machining semantics. How to realize the evolution process model creation from the perspective of semantics dimension, time dimension, and feature dimension, an evolutionary concurrent modeling method is proposed based on the process knowledge and machining feature. Firstly, the geometric evolution process of typical features is analyzed, and the association mechanism between processing semantics and evolution features is constructed. Secondly, the mathematical model of the evolution feature is constructed based on the part processing information, and the creation method of processing semantics-driven evolutionary feature is proposed. Thirdly, the association mechanism of "machining semantics-process parameters-geometric features" is built, and the dynamic evolution process model which achieve synchronous evolution with the processing is created based on machining semantics. Finally, a case study is carried out with typical processing feature. The results show that the multi-dimensional evolution modeling of the digital twin process model can realize the synchronous visual monitoring and simulation of product processing. The correlation based on semantic features can improve the efficiency and quality of process model construction and provide solutions for dynamic analysis and decision-making of smart process design. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Many real-life systems are usually controlled through policies replicating experts’ knowledge, typically favouring “safety” at the expense of optimality. Indeed, these control policies are usually aimed at avoiding a system’s disruptions or deviations from a target behaviour, leading to suboptimal performances. This paper proposes a statistical learning approach to exploit the historical safe experience—collected through the application of a safe control policy based on experts’ knowledge— to “safely explore” new and more efficient policies. The basic idea is that performances can be improved by facing a reasonable and quantifiable risk in terms of safety. The proposed approach relies on Gaussian Process regression to obtain a probabilistic model of both a system’s dynamics and performances, depending on the historical safe experience. The new policy consists of solving a constrained optimization problem, with two Gaussian Processes modelling, respectively, the safety constraints and the performance metric (i.e., objective function). As a probabilistic model, Gaussian Process regression provides an estimate of the target variable and the associated uncertainty; this property is crucial for dealing with uncertainty while new policies are safely explored. Another important benefit is that the proposed approach does not require any implementation of an expensive digital twin of the original system. Results on two real-life systems are presented, empirically proving the ability of the approach to improve performances with respect to the initial safe policy without significantly affecting safety. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In the production of the chemical industry, the data from the distributed control system (DCS) is crucial for reflecting the production status of the process. However, due to measurement errors, it often fails to meet the requirements for accurate process modeling and optimization. Conventional process modeling and optimization studies do not fully consider the deviations caused by industrial production and design data. In this work, we proposed a twin modeling framework based on industrial production data of methanol distillation and chemical mechanisms, combined with industrial experience, to guide more accurate optimization of industrial processes. We established material and energy conservation constraints and assigned weights to measurement variables based on the measurement range of instruments. Using nonlinear programming algorithms and chemical mechanism constraints, we calibrated and solved for the calibrated values of the measurement variables. We also proposed a confidence score model for process variables based on the calibrated values and industrial experience to evaluate the confidence of the measurement variables. By constructing a methanol distillation process model which was closer to industrial reality based on the calibrated measurement variables, we achieved more accurate process optimization. The twin modeling approach combining chemical mechanisms and industrial data proposed in this work has significant scientific and practical value for the construction of digital twin systems and intelligent chemical plants. © 2024 Chemical Industry Press Co., Ltd..

AB  - Baghouse filters applied for gas cleaning are subject to digitalization concepts, including process modeling and the development of digital twins in order to improve energy efficiency and lower particle emissions. Modeling equations from literature were adapted to match experimental data from part 1 of this study to calculate the effect of varying filter face velocities, dust concentrations, or tank pressures on energy demand and particle emissions. Based on the model approaches, an operation curve that enables the evaluation of filter operation regarding the trade-off between energy demand and particle emissions can be constructed. The identification of energetically optimal cycle times and favorable operation regions is possible due to the extensive experimental framework of the model. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - From the first to the fourth industrial revolutions (4IR) or Industry 4.0 (i4.0), the manufacturing sector has always been at the forefront of innovation and digital technology adoption. However, 4IR or i4.0 comes with diverse and integrated technologies that tend to sweep off all the old orders. This study undertakes a science mapping of research on the role of virtual reality simulation (VRSIM) in manufacturing in the 4IR, which reveals several roles and benefits. The analysis of the conceptual structure of relevant literature highlights the contexts, applications, and relevance of VRSIM in the i4.0 era, including its potent role in predictive modeling and simulation, digital twin and predictive maintenance, additive manufacturing and 3D printing, and virtual manufacturing and immersive virtual digital factory simulation. VRSIM also offers a realistic virtual environment for mapping human–robot collaboration in different manufacturing environments, such as aircraft and automotive assembly lines, evaluating processes, training factory workers on safety, and assessing workers’ ergonomics in digital production and operations. VRSIM in manufacturing offers active research activities, with increasing literature publications and impacts attracting core sources in industrial engineering, manufacturing systems, production and operations, and information technology. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This article focuses on a multibody model of a new passive articulated suspension tracked robot. The model of the vehicle is developed using the multibody software MSC Adams (acronym for automatic dynamic analysis of mechanical systems) in conjunction with the Adams Tracked Vehicle toolkit. The various subsystems that make up the vehicle assembly are described, with particular attention to the modeling strategies of the swing arms that constitute the suspension system and the characterization of the track belt. The multibody model allows the system performance to be evaluated in advance for fine-tuning of the design parameters and using different configurations, for example, with active and locked suspension. Efforts are also presented to validate the multibody twin against the real prototype, showing a good agreement with field experiments. Once validated, the digital twin is used to assess the performance of the innovative suspension system in various challenging environments. © The Author(s), 2023.

AB  - In order to perform the inspection planning process on the coordinate measuring machine (CMM), it is necessary to model the measuring system with workpiece, CMM and fixture. The metrological analysis of the workpiece is then conducted, followed by the creation of a measurement program for simulation on a virtual measuring machine in a CAD environment. This paper presents the modelling and simulation of a virtual measuring system based on a real CMM using PTC Creo Parametric 5.0 software. The simulation involved programming the measuring path and generating a DMIS (*.ncl) file, which represents the standard modelled types of tolerance. The analysis of the metrology of the measuring part for the given forms of tolerance (location, perpendicularity, flatness, etc.) was performed. The components of the CMM and the assembly with defined kinematic connections are also modelled. Following the simulation and generation of the output DMIS file in PTC Creo using the virtual CMM, the real CMM was programmed and used for actual measurements. Subsequently, a measurement report was generated. The main result of this paper is the modelling of an offline Digital Measuring Twin (DMT) based on the DMIS file. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Currently, most existing remaining useful life (RUL) prediction models for generators' main wall insulation (MI) focus on the statistical life distributions for a large population of products. The shortcoming of these models is that they cannot incorporate individual degradation information of a single product. To address the challenge of fusing common and individual degradation information, this article proposes a digital-twin-driven two-phase RUL prediction model, composing of three parts: common representation model (CRM), individual representation model (IRM), and dynamic evolution model. The proposed digital twin framework integrates the Wiener process model, Kalman filtering (KF) algorithm, and support vector machine (SVM) model. Specifically, a CRM based on the two-phase Wiener process was established to reflect common features. Then, with CRM acting as the state equation, an IRM was established based on KF, which can fuse MI's individual degradation information with common degradation information to reflect the individual features of single product. In addition, SVM is used to address the issue that the covariance matrix of KF algorithm cannot be updated in prediction domains of long-life products, achieving the dynamic evolution of the digital twin system. Finally, the effectiveness and engineering application value of the model were verified through experiments.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Digital twins have emerged as a powerful concept for real-time monitoring and analysis, facilitating Quality by Design integration into biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Traditionally, lyophilization processes are developed through trial-and-error, incorporating high security margins and inflexible process set points. Digital twins enable the integration of adaptable operating conditions and implementation of automation through Advanced Process Control (APC) with Process Analytical Technology (PAT) and validated physicochemical models that rely on heat and mass transfer principles, allowing us to overcome the challenges imposed by the lyophilization process. In this study, a digital twin for freeze-drying processes is developed and experimentally validated. Using the digital twin, primary drying conditions were optimized for controlled nucleation and annealing methods by carrying out a few laboratory tests beforehand. By incorporating PAT and modeling, the digital twin accurately predicts the product’s temperature and drying endpoint, showing smaller errors than the experiments. The digital twin significantly increases productivity by up to 300% while reducing the costs by 74% and the Global Warming Potential by 64%. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Flood control is the main application field of the digital twin basin. The application of flood control in the digital twin basin not only needs to express the natural elements in the basin scientifically but also must describe the characteristics of human activities. Virtual geographic environment integrates natural elements and human elements, focuses on building an immersive experimental and cognitive environment, and provides a new perspective and method for the modeling of man-land relationship, flood scene expression, and risk cognition in the digital twin basin flood control. This article takes the application of digital twin watershed flood control as research field and proposes a four-layer technical framework for digital twin watershed flood control based on virtual geographic environment. The resource layer covers the hardware resources involved in data acquisition, storage, and calculation in the digital twin watershed flood control application, and realizes unified storage from global watershed feature awareness to data baseboard framework. The data layer provides the relevant data foundation for digital twin flood control applications, including four categories of data: basic data, business data, monitoring data, and geographic data. It also provides the twin layer with the necessary data service support through the steps of data resource extraction, aggregation, cleaning, conversion, and governance. The twin layer is the core of the technical framework, reflecting the interactive mapping between the model watershed and the real watershed. Model watersheds focus on building water models and human-land relationship models. Based on the natural laws of the water cycle, mathematical language and methods are used to describe the changes in the elements of a real watershed, reflecting the laws of human activity and the correlation between human activities and the natural elements of the watershed. Real watersheds lead the construction of digital twin watersheds, upgrade traditional monitoring systems, enhance automatic monitoring and computational feedback control of digital twin watersheds, and support flood control construction and management of watersheds. The application layer is based on the main idea of virtual geographic environment, relying on wearable technology, eye movements, gestures, brain wave, large screens, digital sand tables, and other devices to provide a multiuser, touchable, interactive, and scene-responsive digital twin watershed environment. On this basis, the“four pre”application of digital twin watershed flood control is conducted. Subsequently, the paper elaborates on key technologies such as digital watershed scene construction, digital watershed state synchronization, flood spatiotemporal process modeling and experiment, human-land relationship modeling, and flood scene expression and risk perception, and looks forward to the future development of VR/AR applications in digital twin watersheds and public participation in flood control. The research trend of virtual geographic environment in digital twin river basin flood control can be summarized as follows: further developing relevant disciplines such as geographic human-land relationship, geographic spatial cognition, and behavioral geography; constructing an immersive flood evacuation spatial cognitive environment that allows participants to obtain real-time, authentic, and rich environmental information for interdisciplinary research; and conducting cognitive experiment activities with public participation. © 2024 Science Press.

AB  - Optimizing and predicting the energy consumption of industrial manufacturing can increase its cost efficiency. The interaction of different aspects and components is necessary. An overarching framework is currently still missing, and establishing such is the central research approach in this paper. This paper provides an overview of the current demands on the manufacturing industry from the perspective of digitalization and sustainability. On the basis of the developed fundamentals and parameters, a superordinate framework is proposed that allows the modelling and simulation of energy-specific properties on several product and process levels. A detailed description of the individual methods concludes this work and demonstrates their application potential in an industrial context.

AB  - Pharmaceutical manufacturing processes are moving towards automation and real-time process monitoring with the help of process analytical technologies (PATs) and predictive process models representing the real system. In this paper, we present a digital twin developed for an adjuvant manufacturing process involving a microfluidic formation of lipid particles. The twin uses a hybrid model for estimating the current state of the process and predicting system behavior in real time. The twin is used to control the adjuvant particle size, a critical quality attribute, by varying process parameters such as the temperature and inlet flow rates. We describe steps in the design and implementation of the twin, starting from the conception of the mechanistic model, up to the generation of its surrogate model used as state estimator, PATs and the setup of the information technology—Operational technology architecture. We demonstrate the performance of the twin by introducing different disturbances in the process and comparing the effect on the product critical quality attributes with and without the control of the digital twin. Finally, we showcase the digital twin implementation for the process in good manufacturing practice, through an engineering run, which demonstrated the robustness of the process when controlled by the digital twin. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This article reviews and advances existing literature concerning affective and perceptual technologies, metaverse engagement metrics, and intelligent connectivity infrastructures. We contribute to the literature by indicating that immersive 3D worlds develop on Internet of Things-based decision support and distributed autonomous control systems, physics-based modeling and simulation tools, and spatial computing and environment mapping algorithms. Throughout January 2023, a quantitative literature review of the Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest databases was performed, with search terms including “the virtual economy of the meta-verse” + “movement and behavior tracking tools,” “spatial computing and visual perception algorithms,” and “deep learning-based sensing and digital twin tech-nologies.” As research published between 2022 and 2023 was inspected, only 173 articles satisfied the eligibility criteria. By taking out controversial or ambiguous findings (insufficient/irrelevant data), outcomes unsubstantiated by replication, too general material, or studies with nearly identical titles, we selected 33 mainly empirical sources. Data visualization tools: Dimensions (bibliometric mapping) and VOSviewer (layout algorithms). Reporting quality assessment tool: PRISMA.

AB  - Symbiotic simulation systems that incorporate data-driven methods (such as machine/deep learning) are effective and efficient tools for just-in-time (JIT) operational decision making. With the growing interest on Digital Twin City, such systems are ideal for real-time microscopic traffic simulation. However, learning-based models are heavily biased towards the training data and could produce physically inconsistent outputs. In terms of microscopic traffic simulation, this could lead to unsafe driving behaviours causing vehicle collisions in the simulation. As for symbiotic simulation, this could severely affect the performance of real-time base simulation models resulting in inaccurate or unrealistic forecasts, which could, in turn, mislead JIT what-if analyses. To overcome this issue, a physics-guided data-driven modelling paradigm should be adopted so that the resulting model could capture both accurate and safe driving behaviours. However, very few works exist in the development of such a car-following model that can balance between simulation accuracy and physical consistency. Therefore, in this paper, a new "jointly-trained physics-guided Long Short-Term Memory (JTPG-LSTM)"neural network, is proposed and integrated to a dynamic data-driven simulation system to capture dynamic car-following behaviours. An extensive set of experiments was conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model from both modelling and simulation perspectives.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Modeling and simulation is increasingly used in the design process for a wide span of applications. Rising demands and the complexity of modern products also increase the need for models and tools capable to cover areas such as virtual testing, design-space exploration or digital twins, and to provide measures of the quality of the models and the achieved results. The latter is also called credible simulation process. In an article at the International Modelica Conference 2021, we summarized the state of the art and best practice from the viewpoint of a Modelica language user, based on the experience gained in projects in which Modelica models were utilized in the design process. Furthermore, missing features and gaps in the used processes were identified. In this article, new proposals are presented to improve the quality of Modelica models, in particular by adding traceability, uncertainty, and calibration information of the parameters in a standardized way to Modelica models. Furthermore, the new open-source Modelica library Credibility is discussed together with examples to support the implementation of credible Modelica models. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the process flow of skilled consultants who utilize production improvement know-how and digital technology to enhance production systems in external companies. The concept of a Digital Triplet (D3), which expands the authors’ Digital Twin framework to include the intelligent activity world, is adopted as it aligns with this study’s objective. Given the complexity of the problems faced by production system consulting and the resulting inadequacy of reusing decision-making processes of skilled engineers based on the Generalized Process Model (GPM) using D3, a production system consulting modeling method is proposed. This method incorporates the Generalized Production System Consulting Process Model (GCPM) to generalize the production system consulting process. Using the proposed method, a case study focusing on energy-saving improvements was conducted to describe and analyze the consulting process of skilled consultants. The results show that the proposed method effectively captures the process flow of skilled consultants while considering the iterative structure of the GCPM. Additionally, utilizing the GCPM enables a comprehensive view of the entire process, facilitating an understanding of how knowledge and tools are utilized in various contexts. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Collecting and utilizing data in industrial production are becoming increasingly important. One promising approach to utilize data is the concept of digital twin (DT). DTs are virtual representations of physical assets, updated by real data and enhanced by models. This paper provides an overview of DTs for cutting processes. After giving a definition, we discuss requirements derived from representative use cases. As process models are central for DT creation, we present an overview of the latest research as well as conditions for how it can be implemented in industrial environments. The paper concludes with main challenges for future research. © 2023

AB  - The complexity of interrelationships between urban natural environments and human environments is increasing with rapid urbanization. This brings new challenges to urban modeling and simulation in simultaneously meeting the comprehensive needs of the dual integration of data and models, multi-type visualizations, human-centered simulation, geographic collaboration, and interactions between physical and virtual spaces. We here propose virtual geographic environments (VGEs) as a new platform of urban modeling and simulation. After discussing the evolution, definition, and features of VGEs, we design a VGE framework for urban system modeling and simulation. Two typical cases are provided to illustrate how VGEs support urban modeling and simulation on different scales: VGE-based collaborative modeling and the simulation of air pollution dispersion in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) urban agglomeration, and fire emergency crowd evacuation simulation. In the future, VGEs may also play an important role in digital twin cities and urban metaverses. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The digital twin solution is an industry 4.0 specific tool that has grown in the past decade, stemming from the modelling and simulation approaches that existed before, complemented by new sensor capabilities, cloud processing, big data analytics, and implementation mechanisms. As it is being used mostly in the present by manufacturing companies, the primary focus of the solution is to enhance productivity and reduce costs by optimizing processes and enabling real-time problem-solving, sometimes based on decision-making systems and artificial intelligence. However, as companies are being faced with an increasingly steep list of environmental requirements and regulations, ranging from the classical pollution control and waste recycling to full-scale economic models based on circular economy and transformative carbon dioxide elimination programs, the features of the manufacturing digital twins must also evolve to provide an appropriate answer to these challenges. In this paper, the authors propose a framework for building better digital twins for production systems by incorporating environmental-related functions. The demarches start from analysing existing solutions presented in literature from the point of view of environmental suitability, based on the use of the MoSCoW method for differentiating attributes (into Must have, Should have, Could have, Will not have elements) and determining development alternatives based on the employment of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) for feature selection, and the TRIZ method (Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) for application guidelines. The MCDA was performed within a focus group of nine production specialists from regionally successful sectors. We arrive at the conclusion that environmental-related functions are poorly implemented in the digital twins of the present (although more so in integrated solutions and custom-built applications) and that the development of the proper tools, databases, and interpretation keys should proceed immediately in the fields of production engineering, industrial ecology, and software development to support them. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Digital twins are increasingly important in many domains, including for understanding and managing the natural environment. Digital twins of the natural environment are fueled by the unprecedented amounts of environmental data now available from a variety of sources from remote sensing to potentially dense deployment of earth-based sensors. Because of this, data science techniques inevitably have a crucial role to play in making sense of this complex, highly heterogeneous data. This short article reflects on the role of data science in digital twins of the natural environment, with particular attention on how resultant data models can work alongside the rich legacy of process models that exist in this domain. We seek to unpick the complex two-way relationship between data and process understanding. By focusing on the interactions, we end up with a template for digital twins that incorporates a rich, highly dynamic learning process with the potential to handle the complexities and emergent behaviors of this important area. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) has been seen as an appropriate instrument in several works to monitor and aid in the control of seawater intrusion (SWI) in coastal groundwater systems. This study seeks to discuss the synthesis of a digital twin that couples information between the physical space through ERT as a monitoring sensor and the digital space using SWI simulations to accurately model the behavior of SWI in the present and future settings. To showcase the concept, a Python-based simulation was presented that shows (a) the joint forward modeling-simulation scheme for calculating expected ERT apparent resistivity values from simulated SWI and (b) the calibration of the digital coastal aquifer system through genetic algorithm to accurately match the outputs of the SWI simulations with the ERT measurements. © Fuji Technology Press Ltd.

AB  - In view of the serious coupling between processes in the flow manufacturing process, the difficulty of process modeling, low linkage and intelligent level of production activity planning, a multi-dimensional digital twin model of workshop covering the whole variable space of process flow driven by data and model fusion and its system architecture were proposed. By integrating the static model and dynamic data of workshop production, the entity object model of equipment running through different processes in the production process was established. The characteristics of coupling production line entity object were described from geometry, behavior, rules and other dimensions, then the digital accurate mapping of static and dynamic multi-dimensional attributes of process equipment was realized. On this basis, the digital twin system supporting system data interactive mapping workshop which included physical production line, virtual production line and information service was built. Based on OPC UA and Kepware communication technology, the static and dynamic virtual real mapping and iterative operation mechanism were developed that realized the conversion from coupling of workshop physical manufacturing process to coupling of parameters of each twin. The application verification was carried out based on the silk production test line of a process manufacturing enterprise. It provided a method and realization approach to solve the problem of collaborative interaction and iterative operation caused by the complex coupling of process industry. © 2023 CIMS.

AB  - The term 'digital twin' refers to a virtual simulation/model (virtual twin) of a physical plant or object (physical twin), where data flows between the virtual and physical twins. A digital twin can be used for different purposes, such as process optimisation/control, design, training, and maintenance/service. This manuscript found an increasing number of simulation and modelling publications in literature year on year, which illustrates the current trend towards implementing digital twins in a broad range of process engineering applications. A targeted literature review into the area found several commercial off-the-shelf software solutions (COTS) for different industrial applications providing the necessary flexibility to analyse a broad range of industries. However, most of the process modelling software is designed for petroleum and fine chemicals processes. There is still a need for software solutions that can model a broader range of applications. While most of the software found was licensed, open source process modelling software was also available. There is a lack of independent research into the accuracy of these software solutions. The literature review also found that 37% of the research based on process simulations is carried out to improve energy efficiencies. In comparison, 27% of the research found Decarbonization to be a secondary "added"benefit. It can be concluded that digital twins are ideally suited for driving energy efficiency improvements and decarbonisation goals. However, none of the COTS identified in the literature meets all the requirements for a digital twin. A solution to this problem is to create a layered digital twin, combining and interfacing different tools to accomplish a visually similar, self-optimising, self-learning virtual plant.  © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - In this article, a digital twin approach is proposed for modeling a pharmaceutical drying process using machine learning techniques, driven by data from different sensors captured in-line. The current difficulty with the drying process is mainly due to the manual operator control for choosing the end-point for terminating the drying step. This results in significant variability, depending on which human operator is supervising, and due to the multi-tasking nature of the job, generally allows a longer processing time to be sure the material is completely dry. The objective is to automate the end-point identification, thus optimizing the processing duration and therefore the overall energy consumption of the process. The point at which the drying is complete is indicated by the temperature difference between the ingoing and outgoing air flow. However, the stochastic nature of the process makes the data modeling a challenge. Firstly, a wide selection of supervised statistical and machine learning algorithms was benchmarked to find the one (CatBoost) which gave the best performance with the data. Next, the set of hyper-parameters was found for CatBoost which gave the optimum performance. This gave a best performance of 0.788 (R2) fitting of the drying end-point prediction with the real values, for a large number of batches (over 700 K records). This is considered a good result taking into account the high residual of data models for these data and the stochastic nature of the process. The approach has been deployed in a real setting digital twin to control the drying process cutoff in the production plant. The results show the viability of the approach for modeling the process and automatically identifying the optimum end-point for the drying process, thus achieving significant energy savings which have been quantified as approximately 3.7 MWh per year for the pharmaceutical company. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This review paper was written on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Drying Technology Journal. Interestingly, most of the progress made in the domain of drying modeling and simulation has occurred over the last 40 years. Indeed, 40 years ago, the comprehensive formulation of coupled heat and mass transfer in porous media was available; however, its potential use for computational simulation was only in its nascent stage. This is therefore an ideal time span in which to take a full historical context, to present the state-of-the-art and to give insights into its future trajectory. All aspects are deliberately presented in a pedagogical manner with many illustrations to make the text accessible to young scientists. However, for the benefit of experts, detailed formulations are provided in the annexes. The main points addressed in this work include: The description of the comprehensive macroscopic formulation, An historical perspective of the progress made in computational simulation, The contribution of modeling in parameter characterization, The mechanical aspects of drying: strain and stress induced by drying, including the case of large deformations, The impact of non-local equilibrium, The promising domain of the digital twin in parameter tuning and control/command. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Digital Twins (DT) as digital representations are increasingly becoming operational design tools in a variety of contexts. Although a common understanding of the concept and the underlying development procedure would facilitate DT applications, only limited information has been published on the essential stages of development and fundamental development activities. This paper examines the extent to which an abstract, and thus generally applicable model for the development of Digital Twins can be identified. In order to come up with such a reference procedure, a structured analysis of published development experiences has been performed. Three major application domains, namely product lifecycle management, manufacturing, and predictive maintenance, could be detailed and cross-checked. For each of these domains, a contextual development model could be derived from empirically valid design and engineering practices. The data also allowed for the determination of which way each model corresponds to existing Digital Twin concepts. The use of a standard modeling notation enabled the integration of the domain-specific models into a single Digital Twin development model. As a result, developers are guided by domain-independent and -dependent development steps. Due to its generic structure, the model can serve for further domain explorations. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Process simulation is used to develop a digital twin representation of chemical processes typically for process optimization or what-if scenarios. However, it is known to be computationally expensive and there is an increasing need for process remote monitoring and optimization. This is where machine learning models shine, where they can run up to several orders of magnitude faster than their equivalent first principle process simulation models. Most of the previous work in this area tend to demonstrate the ability of machine learning models to accurately capture complex, non-linear relationships between process parameters in various chemical processes. Two important aspects are rarely discussed, namely the construction of machine learning models using operating data and the deployment of these models. In this paper, we address these two aspects and review the different information silos in industrial settings that need to be considered when working with hybrid models (combining process simulation and machine learning). This is illustrated by a case study for an operating natural gas dehydration unit, covering data management, process simulation, machine learning and visualization. We demonstrate how the hybrid models can be constructed and packaged as an online monitoring and a prediction dashboard. Several unique challenges are also highlighted including the reliability of field data and operational deviations due to operability and controllability - all of which need to be understood in order to successfully translate operating systems to process simulation and machine learning models that are reliable and accurate. While the exact implementation may vary from project to project, the current work serves as an example and highlights the important considerations to make when working with such systems. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - With the accelerating digitalization in education, the construction of digital resources and application platforms has caught increasing attention. The framework of MRI equipment digital twin fivedimensional model is constructed to solve the problems in teaching and training for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A modeling and simulation method based on the mechanism model is proposed. The multi-dimensional physical data are obtained to perform digital human modeling, and the virtual acquisition and image reconstruction method is proposed to generate images. The digital twin data are adopted for iterative optimization to implement the whole process of the three-dimensional visual operation including preparation before inspection, coil selection, patient positioning, parameter setting, and image processing. Application verification is carried out based on the imaging sequences of spin echo, gradient echo, and echo planar. Driven by real-time data, the simulation results are consistent with the operation data of the physical equipment. This meets the needs of teaching training and auxiliary design and guarantees personalized and intelligent adaptive learning under massive teaching arrangements. © 2023 School of Education,Oakland City University.

AB  - A novel Particle Swarm Optimisation Tilt Integral Derivative Control (PSO-TID) is introduced in this article for controlling the temperature of a band dryer in pyrotechnics. Sun drying technique is preferred in these industries but to avoid accidents caused due to friction band dryers are proposed. The proposed system helps in completely avoiding the friction by using hot air drying with heat convection. When compared to the state-of-the-art controllers, the proposed model offers a noteworthy optimisation of 5.99 and 6.483% for step input and 11.765 and 13.21% for random input with respect to settling time, overshoot and Root Mean Square values, respectively. The regulatory response tracking provided a better insight when a disturbance is introduced which is requisite for real-time systems for effective output. The optimal set point parameters and disturbance tracking were also ascertained. Mathematical modelling based on system identification is used to model the digital twin of the industrial finned heating element. The validation of the estimated plot with Final Prediction Error and Mean Square Error proved that obtained model is identical to the actual process model. © 2023, Scibulcom Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Digital twin is a core technology for smart power plants aiming to increase the safety and efficiency of power generation in low-carbon transitions. High-precision modelling of in-service power plant thermal systems plays a key role to develop digital twins, but remains a challenge. There is a lack of high-precision modelling for in-service power plant thermal systems over the full working ranges. This work proposes a hybrid modelling framework combining physical mechanism and operation data to develop grey-box models of thermal systems. Key equipment characteristics are figured out through historical operation data. Moreover, system models consisting of mass and energy balances, process mechanism equations and characteristic equations are implemented. An in-service 660 MW ultra-supercritical double reheat power plant, one of the most advanced thermal power generation technologies, is selected as a case study. The grey-box model of high- and intermediate-pressure thermal system is established. An average simulation error of the model of 0.79% over the full working ranges is achieved. Furthermore, key system characteristics are quantified through the model. It demonstrates the high precision of the proposed modelling method over the full working ranges and provides necessary model support for the digital twin development of thermal power plants. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The development of enabling technologies including big data,industrial Internet of things and artificial intelligence has promoted the deep integration of digital twins and high-end equipment operation and maintenance, which make the traditional regular-repair and failure-repair operation and maintenance mode upgrade to intelligent mode preventive-repair and state-repair, and has become a research hotspot in the field of intelligent operation and maintenance of high-end equipment. By fully using information such as mechanism models, real-time sensor data, historical data and expert knowledge and integrating modeling and simulation processes of multi-disciplinary, multi-variable, multi-level, multi-scale, multi-granularity and multi-probability, digital twin could accurately characterize data characteristics and perform efficient and accurate calculations, which achieved high-precision, high-reliability and high-credibility mapping and evolution of virtual and real space. It provided support for state assessment, fault warning and operation and maintenance decision-making of actual physical systems. The development status, key technologies and engineering applications of digital twin technology in high-end equipment intelligent operation and maintenance were reviewed, and the future challenges and difficulties were summarized. © 2022 CIMS.

AB  - In order to comprehensively promote the engineering application of digital train, the construction of digital bogie was taken as the breakthrough point to carry out the research on the key technologies of digital twin modeling and simulation. The blending of virtual and real between physical entity and digital twin was realized, and the effectiveness and accuracy of bogie’s fault diagnosis and health management were improved. The digital twin of bogie was a data-driven virtual model with multi-disciplinary, multi physics, multi-scale and high fidelity. The input of the model was multi-source data such as its own structural parameters, on-board online monitoring data and regular maintenance data. The output was performance evaluation indexes (such as derailment coefficient, wheel load reduction rate) and structural strength indexes (such as stress and cumulative damage) displayed in real time. It can reflect and predict the dynamics and strength performance of the bogie in the whole life cycle, so as to innovate the existing bogie operation and maintenance mode. A frame structure of bogie digital twin construction was proposed, which can realize the real-time dynamic display and feedback design of key technical indexes of dynamics and structural strength. The four key technologies and technical routes of bogie twin modeling were described. The simulation methods and detailed steps of bogie dynamics twin model and structural strength twin model were given. Some simulation test design schemes were compared and analyzed and an optimal proposal scheme was proposed. A technical route of agent model based on deep learning neural network was proposed, and the effectiveness and accuracy of the model were verified by the cases of wheel rail force prediction and wheel-set stress prediction. The results of this study can be used to guide the development of the core module of digital twin engineering application of bogie and deploy it on the ground center. © 2023, Central South University Press.

Chromatography achieves high separation performances, but often has to deal with the yield versus purity trade-off as the optimization criterium regarding through-put. The initial trade-off is often disturbed by the well-known phenomenon of chromatogram shifts over process lifetime, and has to be corrected by operators via adjustment of peak fraction cutting. Nevertheless, with regard to autonomous operation and batch to continuous processing modes, an advanced process control strategy is needed to identify and correct shifts from the optimal operation point automatically. Previous studies have already presented solutions for batch-to-batch variance and process control options with the aid of rigorous physico-chemical process modeling. These models can be implemented as distinct digital twins as well as statistical process operation data analyzers. In order to utilize such models for advanced process control (APC), the model parameters have to be updated with the aid of inline Process Analytical Technology (PAT) data to describe the actual operational status. This updating process also includes any operational change phenomena that occur, and its relation to their physico-chemical root cause. Typical phenomena are fluid dynamic changes due to packing breakage, channelling or compression as well as mass transfer and phase equilibrium-related separation performance decrease due to adsorbent aging or feed and buffer composition changes. In order to track these changes, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained in this work. The ANN training is in this first step, based on the simulation results of a distinct and previously experimentally validated process model. The model is implemented in the open source tool CasADi for Python. This allows the implementation of interfaces to process control systems, among others, with relatively low effort. Therefore, PAT signals can easily be incorporated for sufficient adjustment of the process model for appropriate process control. Further steps would be the implementation of optimization routines based on PAT and ANN predictions to derive optimal operation points with the model. @ by the authors.

AB  - Simulation technology is widely used in computer-aided process planning (CAPP). The part machining process is simulated in the virtual world, which can predict manufacturing errors and optimize the process plan. Simulation accuracy is the guarantee of process decision-making and optimization. This article focuses on the use of digital twin technology to build a high-fidelity process model, taking the advantage of the integration of multiple systems, in order to achieve the dynamic association of real-time manufacturing data and process models. Making use of the CAPP/MES systems, the surface inspection data of the part is fed back to the CAPP system and associated with the digital twin process model. The wavelet transform method is used to reduce the noise of the high-frequency signal of the detection data, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated to verify the noise reduction effect. The surface topography, after noise reduction, was reconstructed in Matlab. On this basis, the Poisson reconstruction algorithm is used to reconstruct the high-fidelity process model for the refined simulation of the subsequent processes. Finally, by comparing the two sets of simulation experiments with the real machining results, we found that the simulation results, based on the digital twin model, are more accurate than the traditional simulation method by 58%. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - In silico medicine describes the application of computational modelling and simulation (CM&S) to the study, diagnosis, treatment or prevention of a disease. Tremendous research advances have been achieved to facilitate the use of CM&S in clinical applications. Nevertheless, the uptake of CM&S in clinical practice is not always timely and accurately reflected in the literature. A clear view on the current awareness, actual usage and opinions from the clinicians is needed to identify barriers and opportunities for the future of in silico medicine. The aim of this study was capturing the state of CM&S in clinics by means of a survey toward the clinical community. Responses were collected online using the Virtual Physiological Human institute communication channels, engagement with clinical societies, hospitals and individual contacts, between 2020 and 2021. Statistical analyses were done with R. Participants (n = 163) responded from all over the world. Clinicians were mostly aged between 35 and 64 years-old, with heterogeneous levels of experience and areas of expertise (i.e., 48% cardiology, 13% musculoskeletal, 8% general surgery, 5% paediatrics). The CM&S terms “Personalised medicine” and “Patient-specific modelling” were the most well-known within the respondents. “In silico clinical trials” and “Digital Twin” were the least known. The familiarity with different methods depended on the medical specialty. CM&S was used in clinics mostly to plan interventions. To date, the usage frequency is still scarce. A well-recognized benefit associated to CM&S is the increased trust in planning procedures. Overall, the recorded level of trust for CM&S is high and not proportional to awareness level. The main barriers appear to be access to computing resources, perception that CM&S is slow. Importantly, clinicians see a role for CM&S expertise in their team in the future. This survey offers a snapshot of the current situation of CM&S in clinics. Although the sample size and representativity could be increased, the results provide the community with actionable data to build a responsible strategy for accelerating a positive uptake of in silico medicine. New iterations and follow-up activities will track the evolution of responses over time and contribute to strengthen the engagement with the medical community. 2023 Lesage, Van Oudheusden, Schievano, Van Hoyweghen, Geris and Capelli.

AB  - Nowadays, forests play an important role in stabilizing the ecological balance, being one of the most important components of the biosphere. Due to the vital activity of forests, the gas composition of the atmosphere is normalized. Mass forest fires have the opposite effect. They cause irreparable damage to flora and fauna, contribute to the melting of Arctic ice, an increase in the Earth’s temperature, and destabilization of the carbon balance. The purpose of this study is to develop an algorithm for calculating the moisture content and time of forest fire maturation of forest combustible materials. To achieve this goal, the main factors determining a forest fire hazard have been studied, as well as a review of existing methods for assessing forest fire danger and scientific papers on forest pyrology. As a result of the analysis of the research aimed at studying the rate of drying of forest combustible materials (FCM), depending on the physical properties and environmental parameters, a dependency of changes in moisture content over time was obtained. With its help, knowing the initial moisture content of FCM, it is possible to calculate the periods of fire maturation for each component of the forest plantation. Cooperative use of the resulting algorithm with a digital twin of a forest stand makes it possible to identify the most fire-hazard forest areas and estimate the period of their fire-prone maturation. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Modern technological industries fused with the Internet-of-Things (IoT) have been advancing rapidly. The joint usage of several technologies has led to the reshaping of the modeling and simulation techniques into the virtualization of physical systems. Thus, the concept of virtual prototyping has emerged as a significant development in distributed IoT applications that includes early exploration, optimization, and security assessments. Several industries have been employing various types of prototyping e.g., virtual platforms, digital twins, and application-specific virtualization techniques, to achieve individual needs for development. In this survey, we clarify some of these concepts and the distinctions between them, provide a comprehensive overview of various prototyping technologies, and discuss how several virtualization technologies play a transformative role in the design and operation of intelligent cyber-physical systems. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Manufacturing organisations must compete with each other while adapting to the ever-changing conditions by building and strengthening their chains of competencies to survive. Therefore, companies are challenged to reform and reconstruct their product, process, and system models as well as to define new goals conforming to evolving complex and dynamic environments. Recent advancements in technologies such as modelling and simulation (M&S), digital twin (DT) and virtual reality (VR) promise new ways for remodelling organisations’ resources, processes, and architectures. Moreover, comprehensive concepts like DT-based virtual factory (VF) exploit the potential for utilising such technological concepts in the application domain by enabling the integration of various tools, methods, and processes. There are a variety of empirical studies focusing either on the distinct use of technologies, methods and processes or very generic concepts and approaches. However, studies focusing on both conceptual and practical aspects for such comprehensive and integrated solutions to handle co-evolution in the complex manufacturing domain are limited for defining, designing and utilising novel technologies. In this paper, therefore, we attempt to close this gap by (1) framing and discussing the conceptual and theoretical foundations of DT-based VF, (2) introducing and discussing the extension of the DT-based VF to virtual enterprise and (3) generalising and interpreting the prescriptive knowledge discovered during the previous VF demonstrations performed at Vestas Wind Systems A/S. Systems and complexity theories, concepts of business cycles and competence-based strategic management are discussed to frame descriptive knowledge as a language for depicting the internal and external nature of complex manufacturing enterprise operations. Furthermore, design principles of the DT-based VF concept are examined based on framed concepts and theories as well as its potential implications and deviations into different application contexts to provide managerial guidelines for utilising such a concept. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Digital Twin (DT) has become the foundation for intelligent manufacturing as a breakthrough application technology framework and can solve complex vibration problems in the machining process. However, this technology is mainly aimed at application development in a specific domain or a particular factor. The process correlation and interaction characteristics of the system have not been reflected, thus making it challenging to capture the dynamic characteristics of the machining process. This paper presents a system-oriented DT framework with process correlation interaction mechanism that integrates multiple models for dynamic process modeling. The data model is constructed as the core driving model of DT. Based on structural dynamics theory, the weak machine components are taken as digital threads of the data model to correlate position variables and cutting excitation variables. Then, the Frequency Response Function (FRF) corresponding to the principal mode of vibration at the weak machine component is used as an intermediate data for overall online process performance characterization and DT model interaction to enable mirror synchronization of the operation process. The results show that the presented DT can provide multifunctional applications such as cutting parameters optimization, process correlated variables visualization, and machining stability assessment. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers

AB  - Integrated or holistic process models may serve as the engine of a digital asset in a multistep-process digital twin. Concatenated individual-unit operation models are effective at propagating errors over an entire process, but are nonetheless limited in certain aspects of recent applications that prevent their deployment as a plausible digital asset, particularly regarding bioprocess development requirements. Sequential critical quality attribute tests along the process chain that form output–input (i.e., pool-to-load) relationships, are impacted by nonaligned design spaces at different scales and by simulation distribution challenges. Limited development experiments also inhibit the exploration of the overall design space, particularly regarding the propagation of extreme noncontrolled parameter values. In this contribution, bioprocess requirements are used as the framework to improve integrated process models by introducing a simplified data model for multiunit operation processes, increasing statistical robustness, adding a new simulation flow for scale-dependent variables, and describing a novel algorithm for extrapolation in a data-driven environment. Lastly, architectural and procedural requirements for a deployed digital twin are described, and a real-time workflow is proposed, thus providing a final framework for a digital asset in bioprocessing along the full product life cycle. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Natural extracts are broadly utilized as remedies, nutrition additives, cosmetics or flavors as well as natural pesticides, fungicides or herbicides. Green manufacturing technologies are of added market value and are sustainable towards the climate neutrality politically demanded for 2045. The concept of digital twins involves experimentally distinct validated process models combined with process analytical technology that is to be adapted to the existing operations. This is a key technology for the autonomous operations in industry 4.0. This paper exemplifies this approach and evaluates the results of the application and implementation efforts of regulated industries. A conductivity sensor for the measurement of the dry residue content and/or Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy for marker/lead or reference substance concentration determination are the most feasible and straight forward solutions. Different process control concepts from simple PID controllers (proportional, integral and differential) to advanced process control using digital twin models are evaluated and discussed in terms of industrialization efforts and benefits. The global warming potential CO2 equivalent per kg of natural product could be decreased by a factor of 5–10 as well as the cost of goods, which makes the pay-out time for the industrialization investment less than 1 year and the approach highly competitive. The success rate of the extraction process under regulatory constraints can be raised to 100%, reducing waste, overall solvent consumption, personnel efforts and energy requirements to a minimum. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune inflammatory disease that affects the central nervous system through chronic demyelination and loss of oligodendrocytes. Since the relapsing-remitting form is the most prevalent, relapse-reducing therapies are a primary choice for specialists. Universal Immune System Simulator is an agent-based model that simulates the human immune system dynamics under physiological conditions and during several diseases, including multiple sclerosis. In this work, we extended the UISS-MS disease layer by adding two new treatments, i.e., cladribine and ocrelizumab, to show that UISS-MS can be potentially used to predict the effects of any existing or newly designed treatment against multiple sclerosis. To retrospectively validate UISS-MS with ocrelizumab and cladribine, we extracted the clinical and MRI data from patients included in two clinical trials, thus creating specific cohorts of digital patients for predicting and validating the effects of the considered drugs. The obtained results mirror those of the clinical trials, demonstrating that UISS-MS can correctly simulate the mechanisms of action and outcomes of the treatments. The successful retrospective validation concurred to confirm that UISS-MS can be considered a digital twin solution to be used as a support system to inform clinical decisions and predict disease course and therapeutic response at a single patient level. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - The exponential increase of data volume and velocity have necessitated a tighter linkage of physical and cyber components in modern Cyber–physical systems (CPS) to achieve faster response times and autonomous component reconfiguration. To attain this degree of efficiency, the integration of virtual and physical components reinforced by artificial intelligence also promises to improve the resilience of these systems against organised and often skillful adversaries. The ability to visualise, validate, and illustrate the benefits of this integration, while taking into account improvements in cyber modelling and simulation tools and procedures, is critical to that adoption. Using Cyber Modelling and Simulation (M&S) this study evaluates the scale and complexity required to achieve an acceptable level of cyber resilience testing in an IoT-enabled critical national infrastructure (CNI). This research focuses on the benefits and challenges of integrating cyber modelling and simulation (M&S) with digital twins and threat source characterisation methodologies towards a cost-effective security and resilience assessment. Using our dedicated DT environment, we show how adversaries can utilise cyber–physical systems as a point of entry to a broader network in a scenario where they are trying to attack a port. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Science and engineering involve discovery, representation, explanation, and exploitation of recurrent patterns, observed as phenomena. Model-based representations describe not only natural phenomena and engineered products, but also the socio-technical systems of systems that carry out scientific study, product engineering, medical practice, public health, commerce, and regulation. The term “Regulatory Science” invites us to represent and understand innovation, regulation and their intended and actual consequences as observable system phenomena in their own right, using scientific and engineering principles, tools, and insights. This article summarizes three classes of model-based reference patterns central to representing, understanding, communicating, and enhancing systems of innovation, regulation, and improvement over life cycles. In order of increasing scale, these pattern classes are (1) the domain-independent pattern of model-based representation of system phenomena (the S*Metamodel) in the sciences and engineering disciplines, underlying all modeling and simulation; (2) domain-specific patterns representing families of natural systems and engineered products in their life cycle contexts; and (3) the large-scale Innovation Ecosystem Pattern, in which science, engineering, commerce, medicine, and regulation are performed, planned, and advanced—including sharing of managed models and data across ecosystems. All three are applied by the Model-Based Patterns Working Group of the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE). © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Biomedical Engineering Society.

AB  - Modeling and simulation has become one of the core technologies in manufacturing industry. However, the existing simulation technology is insufficient for the dynamic response of the manufacturing process. Digital twin provides a solution for dynamic mapping of the simulation system to manufacturing process. At present, there arc still existing the following problems: (1) it is difficult to recognize dynamic disturbances in the process of equipment operation, and the training process of disturbance identification model is limited by computing and data resources, which is time-consuming; (2) data utilized for identification of dynamic disturbance and update of constraints arc offline or semi-offline, which can not meet the requirements of real-time response. To solve the above problems, a method for responding to dynamic disturbances in digital twin manufacturing simulation process based on cloud-fog-edge collaboration was proposed. In the cloud, a universal model was trained by public data sets, and a personalized model further was trained by edge data to improve the accuracy of disturbance recognition. In the fog, the personalized model was deployed to ensure the speed of disturbance recognition, while the recognized disturbance wasupdatedtothe digitaltwinsimulation model.Intheedgeend, real-timesignals werecolected and uploaded to thefog end.Theexperimentalresults showedthatthe disturbance constraint updating mechanism could accurately updatethe disturbanceand makeaquick responsetothe disturbance during operation. © 2023 CIMS.

AB  - The product innovation design is an innovation-intensive process that requires abundant knowledge and design experience, even across industries and disciplines, as a resource for problem solving. Therefore, designers need to have a good command of more design knowledge in this process. However, due to varied expressions of design knowledge (function, principle, structure) in different fields lead to the difficulty in representation of design knowledge, which makes designers unable to innovate by directly using design knowledge. Therefore, to solve the problem above, this paper, analogous to biological gene, proposes a product innovation process model based on functional gene extraction and construction. The proposed process model normalizes design knowledge through functional genes and help designers acquire design knowledge in different fields, which further promotes the product innovation design. The process model consists of four following steps. First, Obtain the overall function of product based on user needs and decompose it. Second, Build the functional gene model based on digital twin ones to expand the breadth of design knowledge and facilitate the retrieval. Third, Screen similar functional gene by the functional similarity algorithm. Finally, Obtain the design scheme through recombination, transcription, and translation of the functional gene. The feasibility of the research method is verified by using a shared bicycle parking device as an example. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Currently, a mega-trend on digitization and servitization using digital technologies and digital twins to support digital (business) transformation can be observed. In literature, emerging digital technologies are considered as an enabler for the creation of additional value, the strengthening of the customer relationship, and as an accelerator of the servitization process in manufacturing. The introduction of such technologies may result in adaptations of the product & service life cycle as well as the business model. A generic product & service life cycle consisting of four phases – design, simulation, manufacturing, and usage of products and services – serves as a foundation for the integration of digital technologies and related data. It can be observed that there is a gap with respect to data integration between the manufacturing and the usage of products and services. A model-based approach including digital twinning is applied to bridge this gap and to show how data can be integrated along the product & service life cycle. The conceptual approach of such a model-based digital twin environment is presented in form of a meta model. To depict how the integration could be eased and guided in manufacturing, findings of the European project Change2Twin, where a digital twin is established for a paint production pilot, are introduced. This industrial manufacturing pilot was supported by production process models. Additionally, a physical experiment was created to raise awareness for the challenges of digitization and servitization. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Digital twin-enabled neural networks will develop innovative processes in feature selection and simulation. In addition, this methodology will have development in autonomous driving, natural language processing, healthcare, and many other fields. Recently sensors have been widely used for environment monitoring, and massive data has to be processed efficiently and effectively, which requires managed neural architectures for sustainable computing. The sustainable digital twin-empowered architectures create new biological evolution simulation algorithms and intelligent system architectures for supervised and unsupervised learning. Some of today's fundamental artificial intelligence issues, including adaptive machine learning and neuromorphic cognitive models, can be overcome by this methodology. The goals of this special issue on digital twin-enabled neural network architecture management for sustainable computing aim to pay attention to the researchers and industries towards recent advances in decision-making algorithms, neural network models and architectures for faster processing. © Authors.

AB  - The new concept of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and the emergent unmanned aerial vehicles are receiving more and more attention by several stakeholders for implementing new transport solutions. However, there are several issues to solve in order to implement successful UAM systems. Particularly, setting a suitable framework is central for including this new transportation system into the existing ones—both ground and aerial systems. Regulation and definition of aerial networks, but also the characterization of ground facilities (vertiports) to allow passengers and freight to access the services are among the most relevant issues to be discussed. To identify UAM transportation networks, suitably connected with ground transportation services, digital twin models could be adopted to support the modelling and simulation of existing—and expected—scenarios with constantly updated data for identifying solutions addressing the design and management of transport systems. In this perspective, a digital twin model applied to an existing urban context—the city of Bologna, in northern Italy—is presented in combination with a novel air transport network that includes the third dimension. The 3D Urban Air Network tries to satisfy the principle of linking origin/destination points by ensuring safe aerial paths and suitable aerial vehicle separations. It involves innovative dynamic links powered by a heuristic cost function. This work provides the initial framework to explore the integration of UAM services into realistic contexts, by avoiding the costs associated with flight simulations in reality. Moreover, it can be used for holistic analyses of UAM systems. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus) is a commensal bacterium with health-promoting properties and with a wide range of applications within the food industry. To improve and optimize the control of L. rhamnosus biomass production in batch and fed-batch bioprocesses, this study proposes the application of artificial neural network (ANN) modelling to improve process control and monitoring, with potential future implementation as a basis for a digital twin. Three ANNs were developed using historical data from ten bioprocesses. These ANNs were designed to predict the biomass in batch bioprocesses with different media compositions, predict biomass in fed-batch bioprocesses, and predict the growth rate in fed-batch bioprocesses. The immunomodulatory effect of the L. rhamnosus samples was examined and found to elicit an anti-inflammatory response as evidenced by the inhibition of IL-6 and TNF-α secretion. Overall, the findings of this study reinforce the potential of ANN modelling for bioprocess optimization aimed at improved control for maximising the volumetric productivity of L. rhamnosus as an immunomodulatory agent with applications in the functional food industry. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - The accurate modelling and simulation of vehicle dynamics is a fundamental prerequisite for the design and experimental flight testing of aerospace vehicles. In the case of high-altitude supersonic sounding rockets, it is critically important to produce realistic trajectory predictions in a representative range of operational and environmental conditions as well as to produce reliable probability distributions of terminal locations. This article proposes a methodology to develop high-fidelity flight dynamics models that accurately capture aeroelastic, turbulence, atmospheric and other effects relevant to sounding rockets. The significance of establishing a high-fidelity model and of addressing such a problem in the context of developing a digital twin are discussed upfront, together with the key tools utilised in the analysis. In addition to state-of-the-art computational methods to determine the aerodynamic forces, moments and mass changes in various flight regimes (including parachute release), a detailed methodology for incorporating the dynamic aeroelastic response of the rocket is presented. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through a simulation case study, which utilises data from an existing rocket prototype. Results corroborate the correct implementation of the proposed algorithms and provide foundations for future research on virtual sensing and digital twin for autonomous navigation and guidance. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - While the combination of virtual reality (VR), industrial internet of things (IIoT) and digital twin (DT) can promote the integration of the physical world (real) and the digital world (virtual), one of the most important challenges that companies face is the choice of architecture. This study intends to utilize VR, IIoT, DT advantages and to reduce some adverse effects the constituent processes produce when they are individually applied. This bridges the existing gap between the physical and digital machines to enable near real-time monitoring control of the manufacturing process. In the realization of this paradigm shift, we use of IIoT infrastructures by adopting a bi-directional communication protocol for conveyance of data and information between the physical and virtual models in hardware in the loop or software in loop configuration. This study takes into account user case industrial application for the formation of silica scale and methods of reducing its production. In systems operating above pH 8.5, magnesium silicate is very likely to form due to the presence of magnesium hydroxide Mg(OH)2 and silicate (SiO4)4− ions. In this research work, the developed platform (VR, IIoT and DT) is used to remotely monitor and control the process that prevents silica scale formation by maintaining an acidic solution (pH < 6.7). A supervisory control is achieved using VR whereby instructions and commands sent to the physical station for execution. The data collected is stored in a data lake and is used to find the PID controller trends for pH 4 dosing and gain actionable insights. Analysis of the data is done by utilization of visualization schemes, diagrams and infographics. Results show the achievement of near real-time control (correlation coefficient at 99.92%) of a cyber-physical machine using VR by the adoption of bi-directional communication between the physical and virtual models in an immersive environment. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korean Society for Precision Engineering.

AB  - Validation and Verification (V&V) of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based cyber physical systems such as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is currently a vexing and unsolved problem. AVs integrate subsystems in areas such as detection, sensor fusion, localization, perception, and path planning. Each of these subsystems contains significant AI content integrated with traditional hardware and software components. The complexity for validating even a subsystem is daunting and the task of validating the whole system is nearly impossible. Fundamental research in advancing the state-of-the-art for AV V&V is required. However, for V&V researchers, it is exceedingly difficult to make progress because of the massive infrastructure requirements to demonstrate the viability of any solution. This paper presents PolyVerif, the world's first open-source solution focused on V&V researchers with the objective of accelerating the state-of-the-art for AV V&V research. PolyVerif provides an AI design and verification framework consisting of a digital twin creation process, an open-source AV engine, access to several open-source physics based simulators, and open-source symbolic test generation engines. PolyVerif's objective is to arm V&V researchers with a framework which extends the state-of-the-art on any one of the many major axes of interest and use the remainder of the infrastructure to quickly demonstrate the viability of their solution. Given its open-source nature, researchers can also contribute their innovations to the project. Using this critical property of open-source environments, the innovation rate of the whole research community to solve these vexing issues can be greatly accelerated. Finally, the paper also presents results from several projects which have used PolyVerif.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Creating a more sustainable world will require a coordinated effort to address the rise of social, economic, and environmental concerns resulting from the continuous growth of cities. Supporting planners with tools to address them is pivotal, and sustainability is one of the main objectives. Modeling and simulation augmenting digital twins can play an important role to implement these tools. Although various green best practices have been utilized over time and there are related attempts at measuring green success, works in the published literature tend to focus on addressing a single problem (e.g., energy efficiency), and a comprehensive approach that takes the multiple facets of sustainable urban planning into consideration has not yet been identified. This paper begins with a review of recent research efforts in green metrics and digital twins. This leads to developing an approach that evaluates organizational green best practices to derive metrics, which are used for computational decision support by digital twins. Furthermore, it leverages these research results and proposes a metric-driven framework for sustainability planning that understands a city as a sociotechnical complex system. Such a framework allows the practitioner to take advantage of recent developments and provides computational decision support for the complex challenge of sustainability planning at the various levels of urban planning and governance. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Manufacturing processes are becoming increasingly data-driven. Integrating manufacturing data and process models in real-time, a digital twin (DT) may function as an autonomous and dynamic digital replica. This, in turn, may enable manufacturers to not only understand and monitor a process but also proactively control it in real-time or a product over its life cycle. This paper examines the DT concept and its evolution and presents a future DT framework. DTs’ key components (e.g., process models) and implementation are focused on additive manufacturing, electrical discharge machining, and electrochemical machining. Furthermore, current challenges and future research directions are summarized. © 2023 CIRP

AB  - Current trends in urban areas pose several challenges to city logistics stakeholders while also offering opportunities for optimization. With its analytics, modelling and simulation capabilities, the Digital Supply Chain Twin (DSCT) technology provides a possibility to optimize urban logistics processes. However, a number of barriers have limited the implementation of holistic DSCTs so far. An integrative, collaborative platform could decrease these barriers. By applying design science research methodology and expert interviews, this paper develops an architecture for a high-level cross-institutional platform for the generation of DSCTs. This framework includes a modular design of the platform through eight functional modules. The platform can facilitate the implementation of DSCTs for urban stakeholders and thus optimize urban logistics processes. © 2023 Tehnicki Glasnik. All rights reserved.

AB  - Siemens AG in Karlsruhe is facing the current challenges of increasing product complexity with a higher number of variants, reduced batch sizes and shorter product life cycles. In order to restructure their manufacturing system towards a .,matrix production in flow", a process model for replanning and restructuring was designed to serve as a guideline. Supported by the digital twin and simulation studies, an optimized module configuration towards a highly flexible manufacturing with driverless transport vehicles is shown. Challenges such as complex production control can be supported by the digital twin.  © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - In the current era of Industry 4.0, smart manufacturing systems seek to achieve a high level of flexibility and efficiency. This can be achieved by means of incorporating a high degree of automation and autonomous robotized systems along with efficient decision-making systems capable to reconfigure the system tasks in real-time according to the external demands and perturbations. For the fast development of the digital twins of manufacturing plants that include some robotic devices, it is advantageous to use discrete-event simulators, for production process modeling, and the existing virtual environments of the robots and automatic devices. This work proposes the design and construction of software architecture capable of integrating discrete-event process simulators with the well-known Robot Operating System (ROS) allowing easily interchange information between the factory components for fast digital twin development of robotized manufacturing systems. In addition, our proposal allows for a straightforward integration between the digital twin with an autonomous decision-making system. The proposed ROS-based architecture is tested using different discrete-event simulators and the free distribution ROS Melodic. Finally, we present an instance of software architecture for a typical complex case study of manufacturing plants and demonstrate its easy integration with an autonomous decision-making system. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Blast furnaces remained the primary producer of hot metal iron despite the competition posed by alternating iron-making processes for the last 50 years. Possibly, when the hydrogen economy becomes a reality, its importance may fade sometime in the distant future. Mathematical modeling and simulation played a crucial role in gaining insights and thereby helped to optimize the process. Authors opine that commercial CFD packages do not offer enough flexibility to incorporate additional physics needed to develop simulation tools for complex processes like a blast furnace. Also, such solutions are not amenable to online deployment for use in operations. Thus, most of the models presented in the literature were developed from scratch by various researchers. However, these codes are neither efficient in computation, suitable for a parallel run nor better in robustness. In this context, to take advantage of new computational paradigms in terms of flexibility offered through open-source codes, in conjunction with parallelization, a comprehensive 2D blast furnace model has been developed using OpenFOAM®. In essence, it has opened a new pathway towards achieving an online digital twin for a complex process such as a blast furnace. The researchers have used standard heat, mass, and momentum balance equations. However, equations do differ when it comes to reaction kinetics, melting phenomena, etc. In the present study, the melting model uses the beginning of softening and the end of melting temperatures to calculate the liquid fraction formed, which is linearly changing with temperature. This has resulted in improved convergence. The model equations and their implementation in OpenFOAM® are presented in detail. As opposed to the prior art of the blast furnace simulation models, the present study demonstrates the grid independence, as well as the convergence of the fusion zone. The model predicts the size and shape of the cohesive zone and is shown to be capable of simulating various scenarios involving different burden distributions and other operating parameters through a parametric study. © 2022, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.

AB  - Pharmaceutical product development guided by Quality by Design (QbD) is based on a complete understanding of the critical process parameters (CPPs) that are important for achieving the desired product critical quality attributes (CQAs). The effect of process settings, such as the screw speed, the throughput, the barrel temperature, and the screw configuration, is a well-known factor in the setup of pharmaceutical hot melt extrusion (HME) processes. A CPP that has not yet been extensively researched is the type of cross-section geometry of the screw elements. Typically, pharmaceutical extruders have double-flighted screw cross-sections, with some elements having a single- or triple-flighted element section. The exception is a NANO16 extruder from Leistritz, with all screw elements having a triple-flighted screw geometry. We investigated the process setup and scale-up to a double-flighted extruder experimentally and in silico via a digital twin. Two formulations were processed on a NANO16 extruder and virtually transferred to a ZSE18 double-flighted co-rotating twin-screw extruder. Detailed smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of all screw elements available from both extruders were performed, and their efficiency in conveying, pressure build-up, and power consumption were studied. Reduced-order 1D HME simulations, which were carried out to investigate the process space and scalability of both extruders, were experimentally validated. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A fire protection system takes on a critical significance to building operation. This paper describes the use of digital twins (DTs) and semantic web technologies for the intelligent control of building fire protection (BFP) systems in fire accidents. Specifically, a data fusion stage and several information-based control mechanisms are involved in the use of the two technologies. A designed BFP ontology is considered as the semantic model and basis of data fusion between the static building geometric information and the dynamic sensing data. The above information is incorporated into a DT data model, which is considered as the mapping of physical space. Moreover, rule models and process models are developed to achieve intelligent control mechanisms and keep the DT data model synced with the physical space. A case study based on a fire accident simulation was conducted to verify the feasibility of the use of DTs and semantic web technologies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this article, we discuss the technical and business risks associated with long-lasting functional digital twins, and describe different strategies for their alleviation. Functional digital twins are based on physics-based simulation models and are operated alongside the life cycle of their physical counterparts. These simulation-based digital twins are built using a simulation software. The problems with most of the commercial modeling and simulation tools are their black box nature and storing data in protective formats, leading to poor interoperability. Since the digital twins of certain assets need to be operated for a long period, even for several decades, there is a possibility that the computing infrastructure, i.e., the computing hardware and software, may not remain the same throughout the product or system life cycle. The computer hardware and operating systems are usually third-party components with limited choices for their users, whereas the selection of simulation tools is more flexible and the designer can choose from, for example, commercial, open-source, or in-house solutions. To avoid substantial costs or business disruption, the digital twin providers must be able to reproduce the underlying simulation models with up-to-date tools and adopt alternative solutions whenever needed. The findings of the study are presented in the form of propositions throughout the article. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - A practical digital twin for machine tools is proposed in this study. The proposed digital twin is capable of time-domain simulation of machine tools and consists of a controller model, machining process model, and machine dynamic model. To predict the quality of the machined surface after the finishing processes, a precise dynamic model is required. The developed dynamic model consists of an interaction force model, vibration model, and friction force model. A linear auto regressive with exogenous inputs (ARX) model is adopted for the interaction and vibration models. Based on a systematic analysis of the disturbance forces of the machine tool, the friction characteris-tics are extracted to a displacement-dependent friction model and velocity-dependent friction model. A non-linear Hammerstein model is adopted to identify the friction. Online identification systems based on the recursive least-squares (RLS) method are developed and tested for each model. © Fuji Technology Press Ltd.

AB  - The digital twin (DT) approach is an enabler for data-driven decision making in architecture, engineering, construction, and operations. Various open data models that can potentially support the DT developments, at different scales and application domains, can be found in the literature. However, many implementations are based on organization-specific information management processes and proprietary data models, hindering interoperability. This article presents the process and information management approaches developed to generate a federated open data model supporting DT applications. The business process modeling notation and transaction and interaction modeling techniques are applied to formalize the federated DT data modeling framework, organized in three main phases: requirements definition, federation, validation and improvement. The proposed framework is developed adopting the cross-disciplinary and multiscale principles. A validation on the development of the federated building-level DT data model for the West Cambridge Campus DT research facility is conducted. The federated data model is used to enable DT-based asset management applications at the building and built environment levels. © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Digital twin is an important emerging technology for digital transformation and intelligent upgrading. Digital twin models are the prerequisite for digital twin applications, and their quality directly affects the quality of digital twin services in monitoring, simulation, prediction, optimization, and other areas. However, researchers have paid insufficient attention to the quality control of digital twin models, thus hindering their effective application. To effectively control model construction and optimize model quality in the design process, this study developed digital twin model quality optimization and control methods based on workflow management. First, a workflow process model integrating digital twin model evaluation was constructed, which integrated the design process and model evaluation methods into workflow management. Then, digital twin model quality control and optimization in different stages were achieved at the macro and micro levels. Thus, the digital twin model quality was effectively controlled during the design process, and targeted design resources were selected to optimize model quality. Finally, the validity of the proposed method of model quality optimization and control was verified using the digital twin models of a practical teaching platform and a multifunctional lift-and-slide experimental line. All evaluation indexes of the model achieved good values, and the target quality optimization of the model could be performed during the design process. The results indicate that the proposed method can effectively control and optimize the model quality, which has excellent feasibility and enables the effective application of the digital twin. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Cellular materials, in particular metal or polymer foams and beam lattices, are characterized by a complex architecture where the material is concentrated in slender struts. This study is concerned with the construction of numerically efficient sample-specific digital twin for the analysis and characterization of the mechanical behavior of such meta-materials. A method to build an explicit, light, and analysis-suitable isogeometric beam model directly from digital images is proposed. More precisely, as a main contribution, the virtual image correlation method is extended to the case of multiple interconnected beams with varying cross-sections. Special care is also given to the initialization for better efficiency and robustness. Synthetic and real examples of increasing complexity, that is, curved beams, lattices, and foams, are presented to account for the performance of the developed workflow from digital images to an isogeometric twin for mechanical modeling and simulation. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Due to the progressive digitalization of the industry, more and more data is available not only as digitally stored data but also as online data via standardized interfaces. This not only leads to further improvements in process modeling through more data but also opens up the possibility of linking process models with online data of the process plants. As a result, digital representations of the processes emerge, which are called Digital Twins. To further improve these Digital Twins, process models in general, and the challenging process design and development task itself, the new data availability is paired with recent advancements in the field of machine learning. This paper presents a case study of an ANN for the parameter estimation of a Steric Mass Action (SMA)-based mixed-mode chromatography model. The results are used to exemplify, discuss, and point out the effort/benefit balance of ANN. To set the results in a wider context, the results and use cases of other working groups are also considered by categorizing them and providing background information to further discuss the benefits, effort, and limitations of ANNs in the field of chromatography. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The article deals with the formation of model implementations of time series of data (based on in-situ data) of controlled and uncontrolled impacts in simulator-training and digital modeling systems. Such simulators are becoming increasingly widespread due to the development of information and computer technologies, automated research systems, training systems, digital modeling technologies (APM modeling), as well as digital counterparts and advanced control systems. The formed implementations of impacts can characterize situations of normal process flow, emergency and pre-emergency states, or specific representative situations for training operators and technological personnel, software testing, research and tuning of algorithms and search for optimal control actions. Using examples from the metallurgical industry, the possibility of forming several interrelated impacts based on models of nonlinear dynamics and multivariate dynamic databases is shown. The Lorentz system describing the thermal convection of a fluid medium is considered as a model of the impacts formation. The model parameters for the low- and high-frequency components are determined separately, by processing in-situ data. Next, a training sample is formed using normalization and relay-exponential smoothing operations. The implementations of the actions are formed taking into account the mutual correlation of data based on models of chemical dynamics and are adjusted to the specified properties on a limited sample of a given volume with the required accuracy using a generator in the form of a closed dynamic system. The generator in form of a closed dynamic system is built on the basis of a multidimensional generating autoregressive model with adjustable coefficients. An example of the formation of data series on technological parameters of a blast furnace (the degree of wear of the furnace lining, temperature sensor readings and heat flux density) is shown. © 2023 National University of Science and Technology MISIS.

AB  - Adoption of digital twins in smart factories, that model real statuses of manufacturing systems through simulation with real time actualization, are manifested in the form of increased productivity, as well as reduction in costs and energy consumption. The sharp increase in changing customer demands has resulted in factories transitioning rapidly and yielding shorter product life cycles. Traditional modeling and simulation approaches are not suited to handle such scenarios. As a possible solution, we propose a generic data-driven framework for automated generation of simulation models as basis for digital twins for smart factories. The novelty of our proposed framework is in the data-driven approach that exploits advancements in machine learning and process mining techniques, as well as continuous model improvement and validation. The goal of the framework is to minimize and fully define, or even eliminate, the need for expert knowledge in the extraction of the corresponding simulation models. We illustrate our framework through a case study. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Digital transformation is at the forefront of manufacturing considerations, but often excludes discrete event simulation and cost modelling capabilities, meaning digital twin capabilities are in their infancy. As cost and time are critical metrics for manufacturing companies it is vital the associated tools become a connected digital capability. The aim is to digitize cost modelling functionality and its associated data requirements in order to couple cost analysis with digital factory simulation. The vast amount of data existing in today's industry alongside the standardization of manufacturing processes has paved the way for a ‘data first' cost and discrete event simulation environment that is required to facilitate the automated model building capabilities required to seamlessly integrate the digital twin within existing manufacturing environments. An ISA-95 based architecture is introduced where phases within a cost modelling and simulation workflow are treated as a series of interconnected modules: process mapping (including production layout definition); data collection and retrieval (resource costs, equipment costs, labour costs, learning rates, process/activity times etc.); network and critical path analysis; cost evaluation; cost optimisation (bottleneck identification, production configuration); simulation model build; cost reporting (dashboard visualisation, KPIs, trade-offs). Different phases are linked to one another to enable automated cost and capacity analysis. Leveraging data in this manner enables the updating of standard operating procedures and learning rates in order to better understand manufacturing cost implications, such as actual cost versus forecasted, and to incorporate cost implications into scheduling and planning decisions. Two different case studies are presented to highlight different applications of the proposed architecture. The first shows it can be used within a feasibility study to benchmark novel robotic joining techniques against traditional riveting of stiffened aero structures. In the second case study discrete event digital factory simulations are used to supply important production metrics (process times, wait times, resource utilisation) to the cost model to provide ‘real-time' cost modelling. This enables both time and cost to be used for more informed decision making within an ever demanding manufacturing landscape. In addition, this approach will add value to simulation processes by enabling simulation engineers to focus on value adding activities instead of time consuming model builds, data gathering and model iterations.  © 2023 SAE International.

AB  - The composite sheet layup process involves stacking several layers of a viscoelastic prepreg sheet and curing the laminate to manufacture the component. Demands for automating functional tasks in the composite manufacturing processes have dramatically increased in the past decade. A simulation system representing a digital twin of the composite sheet can aid in the development of such an autonomous system for prepreg sheet layup. While finite element analysis (FEA) is a popular approach for simulating flexible materials, material properties need to be encoded to produce high-fidelity mechanical simulations. We present a methodology to predict material parameters of a thin-shell FEA model based on real-world observations of the deformations of the object. We utilize the model to develop a digital twin of a composite sheet. The method is tested on viscoelastic composite prepreg sheets and fabric materials such as cotton cloth, felt, and canvas. We discuss the implementation and development of a high-speed FEA simulator based on the VegaFEM library. By using our method to identify sheet material parameters, the sheet simulation system is able to predict sheet behavior within 5 cm of average error and have proven its capability for 10 fps real-time sheet simulation.

AB  - This paper presents a hierarchical Digital Twin architecture and implementation that uses real-time simulation to emulate the physical grid and support grid planning and operation. With the demand for detailed grid information for automated grid operations and the ongoing transformation of energy systems, the Digital Twin can extend data acquisition by establishing a reliable real-time simulation. The system uses observer algorithms to process model information about the voltage dependencies of grid nodes, providing information about the dynamic behavior of the grid. The architecture implements multiple layers of data monitoring, processing, and simulation to create node-specific Digital Twins that are integrated into a real-time Hardware-in-the-Loop setup. The paper includes a simulation study that validates the accuracy of the Digital Twin, in terms of steady-state conditions, dynamic behavior, and required processing time. The results show that the proposed architecture can replicate the physical grid with high accuracy and corresponding dynamic behavior. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused the rapid development of mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) vaccines and new RNA-based therapeutic methods. However, the approval rate for candidates has the potential to be increased, with a significant number failing so far due to efficacy, safety, and manufacturing deficiencies, hindering equitable vaccine distribution during pandemics. This study focuses on optimizing the production of mRNA, a critical component of mRNA-based vaccines, using a scalable machine by investigating the key mechanisms of mRNA in vitro transcription. First, kinetic parameters for the mRNA production process were determined. The validity of the determination and the robustness of the model are demonstrated by predicting different reactions with and without substrate limitations as well as different transcripts. The optimized reaction conditions, including temperature, urea concentration, and concentration of reaction-enhancing additives, resulted in a 55% increase in mRNA yield with a 33% reduction in truncated mRNA. Additionally, the feasibility of a segmented flow approach allowed for high-throughput screening (HTS), enabling the production of 20 vaccine candidates within a short time frame, representing a 10-fold increase in productivity, compared to nonsegmented reactions limited by the residence time in the plug flow reactor. The findings presented for the first time here contribute to the development of a fully continuous and efficient manufacturing process for mRNA and other cell and gene therapy drugs/vaccine candidates as presented in our previous work, which discussed the integration of process analytical technologies and predictive process models in a Biopharma 4.0 facility to enable the production of clinical and large-scale doses, ensuring a rapid and resilient supply of critical therapeutics. The results in this study especially highlight that the same machine and equipment can be used for screening and manufacturing different drug candidates in continuous operation. By streamlining production and adhering to quality standards, this approach enhances the industry’s ability to respond swiftly to pandemics and public health emergencies, addressing the urgent need for accessible and effective vaccines. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Deep drawing is a metalworking procedure aimed at getting a cold metal sheet plastically deformed in accordance with a pre-defined mould. Although this procedure is well-established in industry, it is still susceptible to several issues affecting the quality of the stamped metal products. In order to reduce defects of workpieces, process control approaches can be performed. Typically, process control employs simple proportional-integral-derivative (PID) regulators that steer the blank holder force (BHF) based on the error on the punch force. However, a single PID can only control single-input single-output systems and cannot handle constraints on the process variables. Differently from the state of the art, in this paper we propose a process control architecture based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), which considers a multi-variable system model. In particular, we represent the deep drawing process with a single-input multiple-output Hammerstein-Wiener model that relates the BHF with the draw-in of $n$ different critical points around the die. This allows the avoidance of workpiece defects that are due to the abnormal sliding of the metal sheet during the forming phase. The effectiveness of the proposed process controller is shown on a real case study in a digital twin framework, where the performance achieved by the MPC-based system is analyzed in detail and compared against the results obtained through an ad-hoc defined multiple PID-based control architecture. Note to Practitioners - This work is motivated by the emerging need for the effective implementation of the zero-defect manufacturing paradigm in the Industry 4.0 framework. Especially in the deep drawing process, various quality issues in stamped parts can lead to significant product waste and manufacturing inefficiencies. This turns into considerable economic losses for companies, particularly in the automotive sector, where deep drawing is one of the most used cold sheet metal forming techniques. In most applications, only sample inspections are performed on batches of finished-product, with subsequent losses of time and resources. For the sake of improving the workpiece quality, innovative strategies for real-time process control represent a viable and promising solution. In this context, the proposed MPC-based process control approach allows the correct shaping of the metal sheet that is getting deformed during the forming stroke, thanks to the draw-in monitoring at various locations around the die. The draw-in is indeed one of the most effective forming variables to control in order to provide a correct BHF during the forming stroke. A useful and easy-to-implement non-linear metal sheet deep drawing process model is provided by this paper to perform an innovative process control strategy. A comprehensive methodology is applied in detail to an automotive case study, ranging from process modeling (model identification and validation based on experimental data acquisition) to MPC implementation (controller tuning and testing and software-in-the-loop system validation). The presented method can be easily implemented on any real deep drawing press, providing the multivariable constrained process with a suitable control system able to make the stamped parts well formed.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Medical device regulatory standards are increasingly incorporating computational modelling and simulation to accommodate advanced manufacturing and device personalization. We present a method for robust testing of engineered soft tissue products involving a digital twin paradigm in combination with robotic systems. We developed and validated a digital twin framework for calibrating and controlling robotic-biological systems. A forward dynamics model of the robotic manipulator was developed, calibrated, and validated. After calibration, the accuracy of the digital twin in reproducing the experimental data improved in the time domain for all fourteen tested configurations and improved in frequency domain for nine configurations. We then demonstrated displacement control of a spring in lieu of a soft tissue element in a biological specimen. The simulated experiment matched the physical experiment with 0.09 mm (0.001%) root-mean-square error for a 2.9 mm (5.1%) length change. Finally, we demonstrated kinematic control of a digital twin of the knee through 70-degree passive flexion kinematics. The root-mean-square error was 2.00°, 0.57°, and 1.75° degrees for flexion, adduction, and internal rotations, respectively. The system well controlled novel mechanical elements and generated accurate kinematics in silico for a complex knee model. This calibration method could be applied to other situations where the specimen is poorly represented in the model environment (e.g., human or animal tissues), and the control system could be extended to track internal parameters such as tissue strain (e.g., control knee ligament strain). Further development of this framework can facilitate medical device testing and innovative biomechanics research. © 2023

AB  - In recent years, Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has continued to develop as a standard for designing, managing, and maintaining increasingly complex systems. Unlike the document centric approach, MBSE puts the model at the heart of system design. Among the various MBSE language development efforts, “Systems Modeling Language (SysML)”, is the most anticipated and broadly utilized in the research and in industrial practice. SysML originated from Unified Modeling Language (UML) and follows the Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM). SysML diagrams help users create various systems engineering artifacts, including requirements, use cases, operational concepts, system architecture, system behaviors, and parametric analyses of a system model. In the early days of implementation, MBSE languages, including SysML, typically relied on static viewpoints and limited simulation support to depict and analyze a system model. Due the continuous improvement efforts and new implementation approaches by researchers and organizations, SysML has advanced vastly to encompass dynamic viewpoints, in-situ simulation and enable integration with external modeling and simulation (M&S) tools. Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a user interactive and immersive visualization technology and can depict reality in a virtual environment at different levels of fidelity. VR can play a crucial role in developing dynamic and interactive viewpoints to improve the MBSE approach. In this research paper, the authors developed and implemented a methodology for integrating SysML and VR, enabling tools to achieve three dimensional viewpoints, an immersive user experience and early design evaluations of the system of interest (SOI). The key components of the methodology being followed in this research paper are the SysML, a VR environment, extracted data and scripting languages. The authors initially developed a SysML for a ground-based telescope system following the four pillars of SysML: Structure, Requirements, Behavior and Parametrics. The SysML diagram components are exported from the model using the velocity template language and then fed into a virtual reality game engine. Then, the SysML diagrams are visualized in the VR environment to enable better comprehension and interaction with users and Digital Twin (DT) technologies. In addition, a VR simulation scenario of space objects is generated based on the input from the SysML, and the simulation result is sent back from the VR tool into the model with the aid of parametric diagram simulation. Hence, by utilizing the developed SysML-VR integration methodology, VR environment scenarios are successfully integrated with the SysML. Finally, the research paper mentions a few limitations of the current implementation and proposes future improvements. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The digital twins (DT) has quickly become a hot topic since it was proposed. It appears in all kinds of commercial propaganda and is widely quoted by academic circles. However, the term DT has misstatements and is misused in business and academics. This study revisits DT and defines it to be a more advanced system/product/service modeling and simulation environment that combines most modern information communication technologies (ICTs) and engineering mechanism digitization and characterized by system/product/service life cycle management, physically geometric visualization, real-time sensing and measurement of system operating conditions, predictability of system performance/safety/lifespan, and complete engineering mechanisms-based simulations. The idea of DT originates from modeling and simulation practices of engineering informatization, including virtual manufacturing (VM), model predictive control, and building information modeling (BIM). On the basis of the two-element VM model, we propose a three-element model to represent DT. DT does not have its unique technical characteristics. The existing practices of DT are extensions of the engineering informatization embracing modern ICTs. These insights clarify the origin of DT and its technical essentials. © 2022, Higher Education Press.

AB  - Complex product design, manufacturing, and service are the key elements of a product’s life cycle. However, the traditional manufacturing processes of design, manufacturing, and service are independent of each other, so lack deep integration. The emergence of digital twins offers an opportunity to accelerate the integration of complex product design, manufacturing, and services. For intelligent manufacturing, physical entity and virtual entity transformation can be realized through digital information. A collaborative framework for complex product design, manufactur-ing, and service integration based on digital twin technology was proposed. The solutions of process integration, data flow, modeling and simulation, and information fusion were analyzed. The core characteristics and key technologies of service‐oriented manufacturing, design for service and man-ufacturing, and manufacturing monitoring based on the deep integration of the digital twin were discussed. Finally, the feasibility of the framework was verified by a self‐balancing multistage pump manufacturing case. The performance of the upgraded pump under the framework was tested, and the test results proved the effectiveness of the integrated framework. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Glass lenses are key photoelectric components of laser systems in semiconductor equipment. The circularity, surface quality, and optical axis precision of the glass lens directly affect the efficiency of a laser system. In the processing of conventional glass lenses, centering is often used to meet specification requirements. However, high-precision processing of materials with high hardness and low ductility is difficult. The process of centering a glass lens is performed according to processing parameters determined by experience, the degree of wear of the grinding wheel, and specifications of the glass lens. Circularity errors, edge cracks, and optical axis errors are common defects in lens processing; such defects must be identified through manual inspection and thus result in high scrap rates and production costs. To address this problem, a digital twin-driven (DTD) centering process optimization system for high-precision glass lenses was developed in this study. The proposed system combines an omnidirectional information model of production line manufacturing data, a virtual process model based on sensor signals, and a design of experiment–based genetic algorithm (DOE-GA). The models of the system are connected through data flow and operate simultaneously to create a high-fidelity virtual simulation of the centering process. To facilitate evaluation of the performance of the proposed DTD centering process, the process was implemented in an industrial setting. The test in the real-world production line shows that the proposed DTD system reduces the time of process development from 4 h to 1 h, decreases the inspection from full to 10% sampling inspection and improves the yield rate by 20%. © 2023 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers

AB  - Industry 4.0 has embraced process models in recent years, and the use of model-based digital twins has become even more critical in process systems engineering, monitoring, and control. However, the reliability of these models depends on the model parameters available. The accuracy of the estimated parameters is, in turn, determined by the amount and quality of the measurement data and the algorithm used for parameter identification. For the definition of the parameter identification problem, the ordinary least squares framework is still state-of-the-art in the literature, and better parameter estimates are only possible with additional data. In this work, we present an alternative strategy to identify model parameters by incorporating differential flatness for model inversion and neural ordinary differential equations for surrogate modeling. The novel concept results in an input-least-squares-based parameter identification problem with significant parameter sensitivity changes. To study these sensitivity effects, we use a classic one-dimensional diffusion-type problem, i.e., an omnipresent equation in process systems engineering and transport phenomena. As shown, the proposed concept ensures higher parameter sensitivities for two relevant scenarios. Based on the results derived, we also discuss general implications for data-driven engineering concepts used to identify process model parameters in the recent literature. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Against the background of the rapid development of social economy and advanced industrial manufacturing, emerging technologies are sweeping the world. The overall planning of urban space is also gradually developing in the direction of "intelligence". The real estate market has been booming in recent years. As a result, the available land resources on the surface are declining. It first gives a general introduction to the digital twin technology and operating rules, and then introduces the analytic hierarchy process and the complexity evolution process model for specific analysis. It first determines the relative weight vector, and then verifies the consistency of the judgment matrix to obtain the simulated probability density function. For the calculation of underground space safety accident risk assessment, the Bayesian network is used for evaluation. This facilitates disaster warnings of possible and ongoing accidents and reduces the adverse consequences of accidents. Then, the digital twin technology is applied to the analysis of underground space visualization, underground construction and underground disaster prevention monitoring. During the construction stage, the bottom of the upper structure column has changed a lot. The difference between the difference between the foundation difference between the adjacent color spectrum column of the upper structure is relatively mild. When digging a large area of ​​ground soil, the foundation dropped to 5.6 mm. When the soil on the side of the pile was removed, the ground building was basically settle down, 0.8 mm. When the structure of the pile side soil is completed, it indicates that the technology of the pile foundation base of the surface building is basically. Finish. Subsequent sidewalk soil has almost no effect on the upper structure. At this stage, the final deposition difference is 2.427 mm, which meets the requirements of the neighboring column base in the current regulations. Finally, I studied the prevention of disaster prevention in the underground space, simulated the accident scene, and obtained the most suitable imaging equipment for the monitoring of disaster. After the prevention of disaster testing and simulation accidents for underground space, the most suitable imaging equipment for preventing disaster testing was obtained.

AB  - Considering the new generation of information technology, the digitalization and intellectualization of the machining process have become the major core in intelligent manufacturing. The complex and diverse requirements, as well as the processing sites force the machining sequence to move towards cyber-physical integration. This paper presents a multidimensional modeling approach for machining processes, by introducing Digital Twin (DT) technology. The method is oriented towards the design and execution phases of the machining process and is used to support intelligent machining. The working mechanism of modeling, simulation, prediction and control of machining process is described based on the interpretation of the modeling and application methods of machining process design, inspection process, fault diagnosis and quality prediction, as based on digital twin technology. Finally, key components of diesel engines are targeted as test objects, demonstrating increased material removal rate by 5.1%, reduced deformation by 22.98% and 30.13%, respectively, verifying the effectiveness of the applied framework and the proposed method. © 2022

AB  - Well construction is a complex multi-step process that requires decision-making at every step. These decisions, currently made by humans, are inadvertently influenced by past experiences and human factor issues, such as the situational awareness of the decision-maker. This human bias often results in operational inefficiencies or safety and environmental issues. While there are approaches and tools to monitor well construction operations, there are none that evaluate potential action sequences and scenarios and select the best possible sequence of actions. This paper defines a generalized iterative methodology for setting up a digital twin to address this shortcoming. Depending on its application, the objectives and constraints around the twin are formulated. The digital twin is then built using a cyclical process of defining the required outputs, identifying and integrating the necessary process models, and aggregating the required data streams. The twin is set up such that it is predictive in nature, thus enabling scenario analysis. The method is demonstrated here by setting up twinning systems for two different categories of problems. First, an integrated multi-model twin to replicate borehole cleaning operations for stuck-pipe prevention is developed and tested. Second, the creation, implementation, and testing of a twinning system for assisting with operational planning and logistics is demonstrated by considering the time it takes to drill a well to total depth (TD). These twins are also used to simulate multiple future scenarios to quantify the effects of different actions on eventual outcomes. Such systems can help improve operational performance by allowing more informed human, as well as automated, decision-making. Development of a system for well construction operations that integrates multiple sources of information with process and equipment models to quantify the system state and analyzes different scenarios by evaluating action sequences is a novel contribution of this paper. The approach presented here can be applied to the construction of digital twins for any well construction operation. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - mRNA-based therapeutics are predicted to have a bright future. Recently, a B2C study was published highlighting the critical bottlenecks of mRNA manufacturing. The study focused on supply bottlenecks of various chemicals as well as shortages of skilled personnel. The assessment of existing messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine processing shows the need for continuous manufacturing processes that are capable of about 80% chemical reduction and more than 70% personnel at factor five more efficient equipment utilization. The key technology to solve these problems is both a higher degree of automation and the maximization of process throughput. In this paper, the application of a quality-by-design process development approach is demonstrated, using process models as digital twins. Their systematic application leads to both robust optimized process parameters, with an increase in productivity of up to 108%, and sophisticated control concepts, preventing batch failures and minimizing the operating workload in terms of personnel and chemicals’ consumption. The approach thereby provides a data-driven decision basis for the industrialization of such processes, which fulfills the regulatory requirements of the approval authorities and paves the way for PAT integration. In the process investigated, it was shown that conventional PID-based controls can regulate fluctuations in the input streams sufficiently well. Model-based control based on digital twins may have potential above all in a further increase in productivity, but is not mandatory to implement for the industrialization of continuous mRNA manufacturing. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Integrated Survivability analysis of naval platforms incorporates the domains of susceptibility, vulnerability and recoverability, measured temporally. These are accepted as key elements when holistically assessing naval platform survivability against threat scenarios. Conversely, traditional naval platform survivability assessment only considered the vulnerability domain or a combination of susceptibility and vulnerability. However, emphasis is now placed on the interdependence of susceptibility, vulnerability and recoverability. Unfortunately, there are shortcomings with historic survivability modelling and assessment capabilities pertaining to Integrated Survivability. This has resulted in the need to clearly define the concept of Integrated Survivability, and identify modelling requirements to assess platforms exposed to the threat environments. A naval platform Integrated Survivability assessment capability, derived from those survivability modelling requirements, will enable naval architects and mission planners to quantify the effects of platform survivability. Assessments will consider platform safety systems and survivability control measures, and changes to those systems and control measures. Outcomes from the assessments will contribute to platform configuration optimisation for resilience against the threat environment and enable mission success. This paper presents the need for an Integrated Survivability assessment capability, defining relevant terminology, and elucidating modelling requirements to develop such a capability. © 2022

AB  - The development and optimization of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations through hydrodynamic mixing is critical for ensuring the efficient and cost-effective supply of vaccines. Continuous LNP formation through microfluidic mixing can overcome manufacturing bottlenecks and enable the production of nucleic acid vaccines and therapeutics. Predictive process models developed within a QbD Biopharma 4.0 approach can ensure the quality and consistency of the manufacturing process. This study highlights the importance of continuous LNP formation through microfluidic mixing in ensuring high-quality, in-specification production. Both empty and nucleic acid-loaded LNPs are characterized, followed by a TFF/buffer exchange to obtain process parameters for the envisioned continuous SPTFF. It is shown that LNP generation by pipetting leads to a less preferable product when compared to continuous mixing due to the heterogeneity and large particle size of the resulting LNPs (86–104 nm). Particle size by continuous formation (71 nm) and the achieved encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 88% is close to the targeted parameters for Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine (66–93 nm, 88%EE). With the continuous encapsulation of nucleic acids in LNPs and the continuous production of mRNA in in vitro transcription, the basis for the holistic continuous production of mRNA is now established. We already showed that a fully autonomous process requires the incorporation of digital twins and a control strategy, with predictive process models and state-of-the-art PAT enabling real-time-release testing. This autonomous control can considerably improve productivity by about 15–20% and personnel as well as chemical reduction of about 30%. The results of this work complement this, laying the basis for fully continuous, bottleneck-free production of mRNA and other cell- and gene-therapeutic drug/vaccine candidates in a GMP- and QbD-compliant Biopharma 4.0 facilities on a flexible scale. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Digital twins are among the most important trends of the fourth industrial revolution. They present a crucial tool for protecting critical mission systems and the development of new services, products, and processes. This paper presents the first digital twin for a data center. The rapid growth of the Internet of things and the areas of modeling and simulation results in high demand for the development of data center digital twins (DCDT) to ensure the safety/protection of critical and costly mission infrastructure and guarantee business continuity, enhance efficiency, and sustain development. This paper presents the design and implementation of a digital twin for a university data center. Different sensory data like temperature, humidity, smoke, and water leakage are analyzed using an intelligent event detection approach, which detects abnormalities using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) fed with the minimum ratio between successive real-time data streams. The performance of ELM has outperformed that of both Learning Vector Quantization and Radial Basis Function-based neural network classifiers and proved much faster in abnormal event detection. © 2023 University of Kuwait.

AB  - Systems engineering practices are evolving to address fast-changing needs in fielding complex systems. These needs create an environment in which system needs evolve or change too quickly to be tracked or managed by humans' natural capabilities. We propose that systems engineering must aid systems engineering managers by providing architectural alternatives and design options. Further, as systems become more complex and dynamic, there is an increased need to identify hidden risks, model emergent behavior, and expose hidden patterns in the behavior of stakeholders. Systems engineering needs to evolve to build fast-fielded, resilient, and adaptive systems that leverage positive reinforcement feedback loops with multiple experimental and real-world information sources. The very basis of systems engineering must evolve from today's development paradigms to a future that leverages modeling, simulation, and artificial intelligence to drastically improve the capability and agility for developing new systems. This paper proposes a common way forward to enable this new form of complex adaptive systems engineering.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Reliable and robust simulation of individual patients using patient-specific models (PSMs) is one of the next frontiers for modeling and simulation (M&S) in healthcare. PSMs, which form the basis of digital twins, can be employed as clinical tools to, for example, assess disease state, predict response to therapy, or optimize therapy. They may also be used to construct virtual cohorts of patients, for in silico evaluation of medical product safety and/or performance. Methods and frameworks have recently been proposed for evaluating the credibility of M&S in healthcare applications. However, such efforts have generally been motivated by models of medical devices or generic patient models; how best to evaluate the credibility of PSMs has largely been unexplored. The aim of this paper is to understand and demonstrate the credibility assessment process for PSMs using patient-specific cardiac electrophysiological (EP) modeling as an exemplar. We first review approaches used to generate cardiac PSMs and consider how verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) apply to cardiac PSMs. Next, we execute two simulation studies using a publicly available virtual cohort of 24 patient-specific ventricular models, the first a multi-patient verification study, the second investigating the impact of uncertainty in personalized and non-personalized inputs in a virtual cohort. We then use the findings from our analyses to identify how important characteristics of PSMs can be considered when assessing credibility with the approach of the ASME V&V40 Standard, accounting for PSM concepts such as inter- and intra-user variability, multi-patient and “every-patient” error estimation, uncertainty quantification in personalized vs non-personalized inputs, clinical validation, and others. The results of this paper will be useful to developers of cardiac and other medical image based PSMs, when assessing PSM credibility.

AB  - Energy and resource efficiency as well as reduction of emissions are nowadays significant objectives for production companies. Industry 4.0, through extensive digitalization along the value chain, enables the achievement of these objectives not only in the construction of new facilities but also in existing facilities as well. This requires an interdisciplinary approach, extending over production and logistic processes as well as the building, technical building services, and energy supply systems, consolidated through integrated modeling and simulation-based optimization. The research question this study addresses is how to digitally couple these subsystems and optimize the overall system’s performance in terms of energy and resource efficiency, by distancing from silo-field thinking while using an integrated analysis approach. The article briefly presents a holistic modeling and simulation framework, utilizing modular digital twins (DTs) of all elements that may constitute a given industrial unit. The integration of multiple DTs of these subsystems in a hybrid (continuous and discrete) simulation forms a holistic DT ecosystem of an existing facility. The particular focus of the study is the building representation in this DT ecosystem for energy-efficient production. Based on a methodology including hybrid simulation, building information modeling (BIM), and visual programming, a semi-automated data acquisition workflow was proposed. The hybrid simulation is based on Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) formalism, where the building is incorporated as a building energy model (BEM). Within the abstracted representation of the overall system, the article explores the possibilities of parametrizing the DT of the building, interconnected with the rest of the factory elements, by acquiring information directly from existing BIM models. Through a comparative case study, the proposed workflow is compared to a manual one in terms of integrity and benefits. The study’s contribution lies in: 1) the detection of the required building level of abstraction for a holistic DT ecosystem, 2) the definition of the interconnections between the building-related counterparts and the rest of the virtual environment as well as the data required for their parameterization, and 3) proposing a semi-automated workflow via virtual programming, for BIM-based creation of the building model within a holistic DT ecosystem.

AB  - In order to improve the accuracy of thermal power unit dynamic process model under variable power conditions to meet the requirements of digital twin model, a series structure hybrid model was constructed. Quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm was used to build global model and interval type-2 T-S fuzzy model (IT2TSK) was introduced to realize the precise evolution of the twin submodel and the transition process. Aiming at the problem that the fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules are difficult to determine in IT2TSK model, a two-step iterative method was designed to determine the parameters of the front and rear parts, so as to ensure that the parameters of fuzzy set can reflect the uncertainty between different state sets vertically, and the fuzzy rules can realize the smooth transition between sub-models horizontally, which ensured that digital twin body model is highly approximate to the dynamic process under all working conditions. Results show that taking the air preheater as an example, the output of parameter online adaptive hybrid model based on IT2TSK fuzzy model can track the actual value more accurately and the overall precision is higher on the variable power training set, compared with the simplified fixed condition model and type-1 T-S fuzzy model. © 2023 Shanghai Power Equipment Research Institute.

AB  - Digital Twin, as an emerging technology related to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT), has attracted increasing attentions during the past decade. Conceptually, a Digital Twin is a digital replica of a physical entity in the real world, and this technology is leveraged in this study to design a cooperative driving system at non-signalized intersections, allowing connected vehicles to cooperate with each other to cross intersections without any full stops. Within the proposed Digital Twin framework, we developed an enhanced first-in-first-out (FIFO) slot reservation algorithm to schedule the sequence of crossing vehicles, a consensus motion control algorithm to calculate vehicles' referenced longitudinal motion, and a model-based motion estimation algorithm to tackle communication delay and packet loss. Additionally, an augmented reality (AR) human-machine-interface (HMI) is designed to provide the guidance to drivers to cooperate with other connected vehicles. Agent-based modeling and simulation of the proposed system is conducted in Unity game engine based on a real-world map in San Francisco, and the human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation results prove the benefits of the proposed algorithms with 20% reduction in travel time and 23.7% reduction in energy consumption, respectively, when compared with traditional signalized intersections.  © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Megacasting is a new concept in the automotive industry. A large number of sheet metal parts will be replaced with one large aluminum casting i.e., a megacasting. This helps to reduce weight, opens up for larger design flexibility, allows for a more circular production, and takes away a large number of assembly steps in the production process. However, there are also challenges related to the use of megacastings. This position paper outlines challenges associated with the geometrical quality of the final product. It covers robust design and tolerancing in early product development phases as well as inspection preparation during pre-production and digital twin setup during full production to ensure the geometrical quality of a product containing a megacasting. Simulations of both part-level and assembly-level deviation and variation are discussed. The paper outlines a geometry assurance process for products containing megacastings in the automotive industry, and what research challenges that are the most important ones to address in this area. It is concluded that computer-aided tolerancing tools must be able to predict the dimensional effects from joining methods such as flow-drill fasteners or self-pierced riveting, to use casting simulation as input, and to handle combinations of solid and surface meshes. Furthermore, there might be a need for adjustments to the joining process based on digital twins to achieve proper quality at a reasonable price. Experiences in using megacastings in the body-inwhite are lacking and a fast learning curve is required. Copyright © 2023 by ASME.

AB  - Light detection and ranging technology allows for the creation of detailed 3D point clouds of physical objects and environments. Therefore, it has the potential to provide valuable information for the operation of various kinds of cyber-physical systems that need to be aware of, and interact with, their surroundings, such as autonomous vehicles and robots. Point clouds can also become the basis for the creation of digital representations of different assets and a system’s operational environment. This article outlines a system architecture that integrates the geo-spatial context information provided by LiDAR scans with behavioral models of the components of a cyber-physical system to create a digital twin. The clear distinction between behavior and data sets the proposed digital twin architecture apart from existing approaches (that primarily focus on the data aspect), and promotes contextual digital twin generation through executable process models. A vaccine logistics automation use case is detailed to illustrate how information regarding the environment can be used for the operation of an autonomous robot carrying out transport preparation tasks. Besides supporting operation, we propose to combine context data retrieved from the system at different points in the logistics process with information regarding instances of executable behavior models as part of the digital twin architecture. The twin can subsequently be used to facilitate system and process monitoring through relevant stakeholders and structure context data in a user-centric fashion. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Model-based methods have a key role in achieving the technical, economical, and environmental performance improvements of the mineral processing systems. However, unmodeled process phenomena and disturbances leading to unreliable modeling results, may prevent the efficient online utilization of these methods at the operational level after the deployment of the model. This study demonstrates the feasibility of online adaptation of a dynamic, mechanistic process models in mineral beneficiation application at a pilot environment. At first, a digital twin of the grinding and flotation stages of a pilot-scale plant was developed. In the experimental campaign, a change from copper-zinc-pyrite ore to a mixture of pyrite-rich and non-sulfide gangue-rich material was carried out. Thus, during experiments, a notable change in the flotation performance was observed, which could not be replicated by a constant-parameter digital twin model. The proposed parameter adaptation framework, encompassing stochastic optimization in moving time windows, was found to be suitable for finding new optimal model parameters during the changing experimental conditions by using the elemental grades in different flotation stages. In addition, simulation studies are presented to highlight the challenges of digital twin parameter adaptation in mineral processing applications, where often only a sparse and disturbance influenced data from the key process variables are available. The adaptive digital twin allows applying the dynamic, mechanistic process models efficiently for predictive simulations in operational decisions leading to more sustainable and resource-efficient minerals processing. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - I draw on a substantial body of theoretical and empirical research on sensory data mining techniques, metaverse assets and services, and virtual twin and holographic imaging technology. With increasing evidence of immersive metaverse and remote sensing technologies, spatial computing devices, and blockchain token-based digital assets, there is an essential demand for comprehending whether 3D modeling and simulation technologies, data mining and virtual navigation tools, and photorealistic synthetic imagery shape extended reality environments. In this research, prior findings were cumulated indicating that the blockchain-based virtual economy integrates remote sensing and ontology-based semantic technologies, visual analytics systems, geolocation data mining and tracking, and 3D holographic avatars. I carried out a quantitative literature review of ProQuest, Scopus, and the Web of Science throughout January 2023, with search terms including “immersive hyper-connected virtual spaces” + “digital twin and metaverse technologies,” “geospatial simulation and sensor fusion tools,” and “object perception and motion control algorithms.” As I analyzed research published in 2022 and 2023, only 178 papers met the eligibility criteria. By removing controversial or unclear findings (scanty/unimportant data), results unsupported by replication, undetailed content, or papers having quite similar titles, I decided on 32, chiefly empirical, sources.

AB  - The production of food is highly complex due to the various chemo-physical and biological processes that must be controlled for transforming ingredients into final products. Further, production processes must be adapted to the variability of the ingredients, e.g., due to seasonal fluctuations of raw material quality. Digital twins are known from Industry 4.0 as a method to model, simulate, and optimize processes. In this vision paper, we describe the concept of a digital food twin. Due to the variability of the raw materials, such a digital twin has to take into account not only the processing steps but also the chemical, physical, or microbiological properties that change the food independently from the processing. We propose a hybrid modeling approach, which integrates the traditional approach of food process modeling and simulation of the bio-chemical and physical properties with a data-driven approach based on the application of machine learning. This work presents a conceptual framework for our digital twin concept based on explainable artificial intelligence and wearable technology. We discuss the potential in four case studies and derive open research challenges. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Digital twin (DT) is not only a core technology of smart manufacturing but also a dynamic intelligent system. By organically combining virtual and realistic models with multiple data sources, DT is used in monitoring product operation status and in predicting product life. A systematic modeling method with high fidelity, punctuality, and efficiency has an important meaning to DT model. However, most of the current DT modeling approaches focus on individual objects and individual aspects of products, and lack of modeling approaches for the whole life cycle and multiple objects, which is not conducive to the mining and utilization of data from all aspects of products. On account of this, a part-level DT modeling approach is proposed based on PLM/PDM theory, integrating the property model, the process model, the simulation model, and the feedback model within a digital thread communication framework, with their modeling methods and application algorithms investigated separately. The results of the Part Digital Twin Model (PDTM) are presented by virtue of a visualization platform. There is interaction among customers, designers, and processors throughout the entire system, ensuring real-time monitoring of product manufacturing process. Finally, a test case of hanging axle is implemented, aiming at validating the proposed part-level DT modeling method. According to the result of this case, the proposed method in this paper can be used in generating the property of hanging axle, and giving real-time monitoring to the whole lifecycle of hanging axle, thereby demonstrating its feasibility. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - For the next coming years, metaverse, digital twin and autonomous vehicle applications are the leading technologies for many complex applications hitherto inaccessible such as health and life sciences, smart home, smart agriculture, smart city, smart car and logistics, Industry 4.0, entertainment (video game) and social media applications, due to recent tremendous developments in process modeling, supercomputing, cloud data analytics (deep learning, etc.), communication network and AIoT/IIoT/IoT technologies. AIoT/IIoT/IoT is a crucial research field because it provides the essential data to fuel metaverse, digital twin, real-time Industry 4.0 and autonomous vehicle applications. However, the science of AIoT is inherently multidisciplinary, and therefore, it is difficult for readers to understand its evolution and impacts. Our main contribution in this article is to analyze and highlight the trends and challenges of the AIoT technology ecosystem including core hardware (MCU, MEMS/NEMS sensors and wireless access medium), core software (operating system and protocol communication stack) and middleware (deep learning on a microcontroller: TinyML). Two low-powered AI technologies emerge: TinyML and neuromorphic computing, but only one AIoT/IIoT/IoT device implementation using TinyML dedicated to strawberry disease detection as a case study. So far, despite the very rapid progress of AIoT/IIoT/IoT technologies, several challenges remain to be overcome such as safety, security, latency, interoperability and reliability of sensor data, which are essential characteristics to meet the requirements of metaverse, digital twin, autonomous vehicle and Industry 4.0. applications. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The paper describes the state-of-the-art in modeling and simulation of surface texture and topography generation at micro and nano dimensional scales. Three main classes of manufacturing processes used for the generation of engineering surfaces are considered: material removal processes, material conservative processes, and material additive processes. Types of modeling techniques for the simulation of surface generation are reviewed and discussed including analytical models, numerical multi-physics models, and data-driven methods. After presenting the application of those modeling techniques for the prediction of characteristics and geometry of surfaces generated by different manufacturing processes, their performance, implementation, and accuracy are discussed. Finally, a roadmap for the realization of a complete surface generation digital twin in manufacturing is outlined. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - The combination of machine learning methods together with computational modeling and simulation of the cardiovascular system brings the possibility of obtaining very valuable information about new therapies or clinical devices through in-silico experiments. However, the application of machine learning methods demands access to large cohorts of patients. As an alternative to medical data acquisition and processing, which often requires some degree of manual intervention, the generation of virtual cohorts made of synthetic patients can be automated. However, the generation of a synthetic sample can still be computationally demanding to guarantee that it is clinically meaningful and that it reflects enough inter-patient variability. This paper addresses the problem of generating virtual patient cohorts of thoracic aorta geometries that can be used for in-silico trials. In particular, we focus on the problem of generating a cohort of patients that meet a particular clinical criterion, regardless the access to a reference sample of that phenotype. We formalize the problem of clinically-driven sampling and assess several sampling strategies with two goals, sampling efficiency, i.e., that the generated individuals actually belong to the target population, and that the statistical properties of the cohort can be controlled. Our results show that generative adversarial networks can produce reliable, clinically-driven cohorts of thoracic aortas with good efficiency. Moreover, non-linear predictors can serve as an efficient alternative to the sometimes expensive evaluation of anatomical or functional parameters of the organ of interest. © Copyright © 2021 Romero, Lozano, Martínez-Gil, Serra, Sebastián, Lamata and García-Fernández.

AB  - The use of digital technologies affects all stages of agricultural production, transforming and improving business processes, models, and structures. In this regard, the efficiency of implementing the digital platform in the strategic development of an agricultural enterprise is an urgent scientific task. The purpose of this research is to develop practical recommendations for improving the information support of agricultural enterprises in conditions of digitalization based on the elaboration of the digital platform for the agro-industrial complex. The research is methodologically based on a systematic approach, methods of analysis and ITIL-based modeling. As part of the research, an organizational and economic mechanism has been developed to improve the information support of an agricultural enterprise in conditions of digitalization, the main components of which are the ITIL methodology and the ITSM-based management approach, material and technical, personnel, scientific and information consulting, and financial and economic support. Application of the organizational and economic mechanism developed will significantly facilitate the elaboration of similar projects. The authors have developed the model of the digital platform for the agroindustrial complex of the Komi Republic, which includes the necessary modules, with the prospect of subsequent strategic development based on the introduction of Digital Twins Technology. Operation of the digital platform proposed will make it possible to proactively use best practices, optimize the resources used in production, expand the agricultural producers’ access to information on markets and prices, enhance the authorities’ interaction with various economic entities, and ensure digital literacy among industry workers © 2022, International Journal of Technology.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The construction machinery arm is the key component of construction machinery to complete the operation task; its assembly link directly affects the product quality and operational performance of the whole machinery. To solve the problems of low assembly efficiency and the inability to fully reflect the assembly process indexes and product characteristics in the traditional construction machinery arm assembly, this paper studies assembly process modeling and simulation for the construction machinery arm based on assembly sensing data and digital twin. By extracting and processing the assembly resource data and field measurement data of the machinery arm, the assembly process information database under the digital twin environment is constructed, which lays the foundation for the virtual assembly model construction of the machinery arm. Through the real-time data interaction between virtual space and physical space, a complete assembly of digital twin spaces is formed. Finally, taking the assembly line of an excavator armed as an example, it is shown that the digital twin-based assembly simulation can monitor the assembly process in real-time and optimize its configuration to improve assembly efficiency. Therefore, an effective closed-loop feedback mechanism is constructed for the whole assembly process of the construction machinery arm. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Transportation of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) by sea has been intensified in the current shipping environment, opening new markets and trade routes. LNG carriers are inherently complex vessels, featuring a high degree of integration of their energy conversion systems, all operating under time and load varying mission profiles, making design decisions non-trivial. To this end, DNVGL COSSMOS (Complex Ship Systems Modelling and Simulation) in-house process modelling framework is used to build digital twins of the propulsion and cargo module of LNG carriers, modelling the entire energy conversion process from cargo tanks to useful energy required for propulsion, electricity and heat. Emphasis is given on reliquefaction systems and the improvement they provide in performance, comparing the currently available technologies and giving deeper insight for the Joule-Thomson systems. The overall ship system performance is improved by 5–15% along the low vessel speed range and 25–40% for the anchorage loaded port condition, when partial reliquefaction systems are considered, depending on the configuration they are compared to. Engine technology also plays an important role, with high-pressure engines exhibiting 3–10% better performance, depending on the reliquefaction technology coupled with, along the high vessel speed range, mainly because of their inherent better performance. © 2020

AB  - To realize the deep integration of complex product manufacturing and operation and maintenance processes, while eliminate the phenomenon of information islands generated in the manufacturing and operation and maintenance links, in the light of the lack of in-depth integration in the manufacturing and operation and maintenance process of complex products. With the help of digital twin technology, this paper puts forward the overall framework manufacturing and operation and maintenance integration of a complex product based on digital twin and the system integration mode of virtual and real integration. The solutions of complex product integration of manufacturing and operations and maintenance, data fusion, modeling and simulation, and manufacturing plant operation mode based on digital twin are analyzed. The key technologies based on digital twin deep integration of manufacturing and operation and maintenance, fault prediction, and knowledge base/case library construction are discussed. Finally, combined with the fault prediction case of a certain type of electric multiple units (EMU) bogie, the associated operation mode between the operation and maintenance process of the EMU and the manufacturer is demonstrated, which proves the feasibility and effectiveness of the integration method. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In biomechanical field, several studies used OpenSim software to compute the joint reaction forces from kinematics and ground reaction forces measurements. The bio-inspired joints design and their manufacturing need the usage of mechanical modeling and simulation software tools. This paper proposes a new hybrid methodology to determine biological joint reaction forces from in vivo measurements using both biomechanical and mechanical engineering softwares. The methodology has been applied to the horse forelimb joints. The computed joint reaction forces results would be compared to the results obtained with OpenSim in a previous study. This new hybrid model used a combination of measurements (bone geometry, kinematics, ground reaction forces..) and also OpenSim results (muscular and ligament forces). The comparison between the two models showed values with an average difference of 8% at trotting and 16% at jumping. These differences can be associated with the differences between the modelling strategies. Despite these differences, the mechanical modeling method allows the computation of advanced simulations to handle contact conditions in joints. In future, the proposed mechanical engineering methodology could open the door to define a biological digital twin of a quadruped limb including the real geometry modelling of the joint.  © J.

AB  - The pandemic of 2019 has led to an enormous interest in all aspects of modeling and simulation of infectious diseases. One central issue is the redesign and deployment of ventilation systems to mitigate the transmission of infectious diseases, produced by respiratory emissions such as coughs. This work seeks to develop a combined Digital-Twin and Machine-Learning framework to optimize ventilation systems by building on rapidly computable respiratory emission models developed in Zohdi (Comput Mech 64:1025–1034, 2020). This framework ascertains the placement and flow rates of multiple ventilation units, in order to optimally sequester particles released from respiratory emissions such as coughs, sneezes, etc. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the framework. © 2021, CIMNE, Barcelona, Spain.

AB  - Automation, artificial intelligence and sensor-enabled applications are part of everyday life comprising technical systems that utilize environment-perceiving sensors. Here, rough environments often require robust sensor technologies such as radar, coupled with application-specific software evaluating the measured data. The rising complexity of underlying sensor systems (hard- and software) and complex physical interactions with dynamic environments require development-related validations that use virtual methods primarily focusing on close-to-reality sensor simulation. To allow for a wide range of applications, we propose the use of reusable building blocks that generically model and mimic the physical structure from the real world. This includes the whole path between sensor and 3D environment with respect to sensor-intrinsic characteristics as well as environmental influences such as rain. At the same time, computational scalability of each building block allows physical simulations generating reliable sensor data even in real-time applications. As a result, Digital Twins of relevant components, systems and environments are no longer acting on their own but interacting within Virtual Testbeds allowing for virtual validation of radar-based applications with respect to the operational environment. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Industrial discrete event dynamic systems (DEDSs) are commonly modeled by means of Petri nets (PNs). PNs have the capability to model behaviors such as concurrency, synchronization, and resource sharing, compared to a step transition function chart or GRAphe Fonctionnel de Commande Etape Transition (GRAFCET) which is a particular case of a PN. However, there is not an effective systematic way to implement a PN in a programmable logic controller (PLC), and so the implementation of such a controller outside a PLC in some external software that will communicate with the PLC is very common. There have been some attempts to implement PNs within a PLC, but they are dependent on how the logic of places and transitions is programmed for each application. This work proposes a novel application-independent and platform-independent PN implementation methodology. This methodology is a systematic way to implement a PN controller within industrial PLCs. A great portion of the code will be validated automatically prior to PLC implementation. Net structure and marking evolution will be checked on the basis of PN model structural analysis, and only net interpretation will be manually coded and error-prone. Thus, this methodology represents a systematic and semi-compiled PN implementation method. A use case supported by a digital twin (DT) is shown where the automated solution required by a manufacturing system is carried out and executed in two different devices for portability testing, and the scan cycle periods are compared for both approaches. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Cities are complex systems connected to economic, ecological, and demographic conditions and change. They are also characterized by diverging perceptions and interests of citizens and stakeholders. Thus, in the arena of urban planning, we are in need of approaches that are able to cope not only with urban complexity but also allow for participatory and collaborative processes to empower citizens. This to create democratic cities. Connected to the field of smart cities and citizens, we present in this paper, the prototype of an urban digital twin for the 30,000-people town of Herrenberg in Germany. Urban digital twins are sophisticated data models allowing for collaborative processes. The herein presented prototype comprises (1) a 3D model of the built environment, (2) a street network model using the theory and method of space syntax, (3) an urban mobility simulation, (4) a wind flow simulation, and (5) a number of empirical quantitative and qualitative data using volunteered geographic information (VGI). In addition, the urban digital twin was implemented in a visualization platform for virtual reality and was presented to the general public during diverse public participatory processes, as well as in the framework of the "Morgenstadt Werkstatt" (Tomorrow's Cities Workshop). The results of a survey indicated that this method and technology could significantly aid in participatory and collaborative processes. Further understanding of how urban digital twins support urban planners, urban designers, and the general public as a collaboration and communication tool and for decision support allows us to be more intentional when creating smart cities and sustainable cities with the help of digital twins. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the presented results and further research directions. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The realisation of precision cardiology requires novel techniques for the non-invasive characterisation of individual patients’ cardiac function to inform therapeutic and diagnostic decision-making. Both electrocardiography and imaging are used for the clinical diagnosis of cardiac disease. The integration of multi-modal datasets through advanced computational methods could enable the development of the cardiac ‘digital twin’, a comprehensive virtual tool that mechanistically reveals a patient's heart condition from clinical data and simulates treatment outcomes. The adoption of cardiac digital twins requires the non-invasive efficient personalisation of the electrophysiological properties in cardiac models. This study develops new computational techniques to estimate key ventricular activation properties for individual subjects by exploiting the synergy between non-invasive electrocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and modelling and simulation. More precisely, we present an efficient sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation-based inference method, integrated with Eikonal simulations and torso-biventricular models constructed based on clinical CMR imaging. The method also includes a novel strategy to treat combined continuous (conduction speeds) and discrete (earliest activation sites) parameter spaces and an efficient dynamic time warping-based ECG comparison algorithm. We demonstrate results from our inference method on a cohort of twenty virtual subjects with cardiac ventricular myocardial-mass volumes ranging from 74 cm3 to 171 cm3 and considering low versus high resolution for the endocardial discretisation (which determines possible locations of the earliest activation sites). Results show that our method can successfully infer the ventricular activation properties in sinus rhythm from non-invasive epicardial activation time maps and ECG recordings, achieving higher accuracy for the endocardial speed and sheet (transmural) speed than for the fibre or sheet-normal directed speeds. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - In the context of Industry 4.0, a growing use is being made of simulation-based decision-support tools commonly named Digital Twins. Digital Twins are replicas of the physical manufacturing assets, providing means for the monitoring and control of individual assets. Although extensive research on Digital Twins and their applications has been carried out, the majority of existing approaches are asset specific. Little consideration is made of human factors and interdependencies between different production assets are commonly ignored. In this paper, we address those limitations and propose innovations for cognitive modeling and co-simulation which may unleash novel uses of Digital Twins in Factories of the Future. We introduce a holistic Digital Twin approach, in which the factory is not represented by a set of separated Digital Twins but by a comprehensive modeling and simulation capacity embracing the full manufacturing process including external network dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce novel approaches for integrating models of human behavior and capacities for security testing with Digital Twins and show how the holistic Digital Twin can enable new services for the optimization and resilience of Factories of the Future. To illustrate this approach, we introduce a specific use-case implemented in field of Aerospace System Manufacturing. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Fabricated wind turbine blades have unavoidable deviations from their designs due to imperfections in the manufacturing processes. Model updating is a common approach to enhance model predictions and therefore improve the numerical blade design accuracy compared to the built blade. An updated model can provide a basis for a digital twin of the rotor blade including the manufacturing deviations. Classical optimization algorithms, most often combined with reduced order or surrogate models, represent the state of the art in structural model updating. However, these deterministic methods suffer from high computational costs and a missing probabilistic evaluation. This feasibility study approaches the model updating task by inverting the model through the application of invertible neural networks, which allow for inferring a posterior distribution of the input parameters from given output parameters, without costly optimization or sampling algorithms. In our use case, rotor blade cross sections are updated to match given cross-sectional parameters. To this end, a sensitivity analysis of the input (material properties or layup locations) and output parameters (such as stiffness and mass matrix entries) first selects relevant features in advance to then set up and train the invertible neural network. The trained network predicts with outstanding accuracy most of the selected cross-sectional input parameters for different radial positions; that is, the posterior distribution of these parameters shows a narrow width. At the same time, it identifies some parameters that are hard to recover accurately or contain intrinsic ambiguities. Hence, we demonstrate that invertible neural networks are highly capable for structural model updating. © 2021 The Authors. Wind Energy published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This paper introduces a new framework for understanding, modelling and software engineering in construction information activities. The current framework is based on understanding that products are the results of processes, which are performed by actors. Such frameworks are influenced by the available technology. The Internet of today is supporting also other kinds of human activities: communication and social interactions among humans. The construction industry uses them as well but without having a proper understanding of their role. There is a gap in the current framework. In this paper, the relevant theories to specify this gap in terms of what could exist in theory and what is offered by technology are analysed. As a result, a new framework of construction information activities that fills the gap is proposed. The key concepts and relations among them are identified and elaborated within the existing framework. The framework introduces the third major integrative element of the otherwise fragmented construction information activities–the social network–the existing two being the physical building and its digital twin. The framework provides a theoretical and conceptual basis for designing, planning, creating, monitoring and evaluating construction-related online services that include a strong social component and use social media services. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - A continuous integrated bioprocess available from the earliest stages of process development allows for an easier, more efficient and faster development and characterization of an integrated process as well as production of small-scale drug candidates. The process presented in this article is a proof-of-concept of a continuous end-to-end monoclonal antibody production platform at a very small scale based on a 200 ml alternating tangential flow filtration perfusion bioreactor, integrated with the purification process with a model-based design and control. The downstream process, consisting of a periodic twin-column protein A capture, a virus inactivation, a CEX column and an AEX column, was compactly implemented in a single chromatography system, with a purification time of less than 4 hr. Monoclonal antibodies were produced for 17 days in a high cell density perfusion culture of CHO cells with titers up to 1.0 mg/ml. A digital twin of the downstream process was created by modelling all the chromatography steps. These models were used for real-time decision making by the implementation of control strategies to automatize and optimize the operation of the process. A consistent glycosylation pattern of the purified product was ensured by the steady state operation of the process. Regarding the removal of impurities, at least a 4-log reduction in the HCP levels was achieved. The recovery yield was up to 60%, and a maximum productivity of 0.8 mg/ml/day of purified product was obtained. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Building information modelling (BIM) technology has been focusing on the creation, sharing and use of a comprehensive digital twin of the facility under construction or renovation. It is believed that a more comprehensive, structured and complete model would be better. The aim of this paper and the underlying research is to reaffirm the view that the essence of information is to inform the user and that the main purpose of information models is that they are informative-that they contain the necessary information. Parsimonious information is information that is necessary but as simple as possible. Our hypothesis is that in many cases simpler models could be more useful, as they do not introduce technological barriers with the usually involved low-and medium-level contractors. One such case is the energy retrofitting of existing buildings. Many public and residential buildings with poor energy performance are located all over the world, especially in Eastern and Central Europe, as well as in China. They are an efficient target for a significant improvement in their energy performance by improving the building envelope and openings. The paper presents an economical process model for the modernisation of existing buildings. This model provides a basis for a parsimonious product model, which is currently under development. The broader objective of the research presented is to examine cases where a heavy information model may not be necessary and where a detailed process definition-as described in the BIM implementation plan and related documents-would lead to over-specification that would limit the free dynamics of a workflow.  © 2022 iga Turk et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - This paper presents a brief introduction to competition-driven digital transformation in the machining sector. On this basis, the creation of a digital twin for machining processes is approached firstly using a basic digital twin structure. The latter is sub-grouped into information and data models, specific calculation and process models, all seen from an application-oriented perspective. Moreover, digital shadow and digital twin are embedded in this framework, being discussed in the context of a state-of-the-art literature review. The main part of this paper addresses models for machine and path inaccuracies, material removal and tool engagement, cutting force, process stability, thermal behavior, workpiece and surface properties. Furthermore, these models are superimposed towards an integral digital twin. In addition, the overall context is expanded towards an integral software architecture of a digital twin providing information system. The information system, in turn, ties in with existing forward-oriented planning from operational practice, leading to a significant expansion of the initially presented basic structure for a digital twin. Consequently, a time-stratified data layer platform is introduced to prepare for the resulting shadow-twin transformation loop. Finally, subtasks are defined to assure functional interfaces, model integrability and feedback measures. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a creative generation process model based on the quantum modeling simulation method. This model is mainly aimed at generating the running trajectory of a dancing robot and the execution plan of the dancing action. First, we used digital twin technology to establish data mapping between the robot and the computer simulation environment to realize intelligent controllability of the robot's trajectory and the dance movements described in this paper. Second, we conducted many experiments and carried out a lot of research into information retrieval, information fidelity, and result evaluation. We constructed a multilevel three-dimensional spatial quantum knowledge map (M-3DQKG) based on the coherence and entangled states of quantum modeling and simulation. Combined with dance videos, we used regions with convolutional neural networks (R-CNNs) to extract character bones and movement features to form a movement library. We used M-3DQKG to quickly retrieve information from the knowledge base, action library, and database, and then the system generated action models through a holistically nested edge detection (HED) network. The system then rendered scenes that matched the actions through generative adversarial networks (GANs). Finally, the scene and dance movements were integrated, and the creative generation process was completed. This paper also proposes the creativity generation coefficient as a means of evaluating the results of the creative process, combined with artificial brain electroenchalographic data to assist in evaluating the degree of agreement between creativity and needs. This paper aims to realize the automation and intelligence of the creative generation process and improve the creative generation effect and usability of dance movements. Experiments show that this paper has significantly improved the efficiency of knowledge retrieval and the accuracy of knowledge acquisition, and can generate unique and practical dance moves. The robot's trajectory is novel and changeable, and can meet the needs of dance performances in different scenes. The creative generation process of dancing robots combined with deep learning and quantum technology is a required field for future development, and could provide a considerable boost to the progress of human society. © Copyright © 2020 Mei, Ding, Jin, Zhang and Jiao.

AB  - Nowadays, several manufacturing systems are evolving towards a greater collaboration between human and robots. The development of such systems requires integrated design tasks involving many disciplines and domains such as systems engineering, safety analyses and multiphysics. Furthermore, the increasing presence of multiple and structured requirements makes the use of models inevitable during the designing phases and also strongly helpful during other phases of the system life-cycle. Besides, for a better efficiency, there is an increasing demand to have a Digital Twin of the system to be used for different purposes such as design improvements by playing different scenarios, virtual commissioning and controlling maintenance activities. In this paper, we first summarize the research context, the reference methodologies, and the emerging needs for Digital Twin creation. Then, we apply a design approach including Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), Model-Based Safety Assessment (MBSA) and multi-physics modeling for the design of a collaborative workplace for the assembly of Electro-Mechanical Actuators on an aircraft wing. An operational flow to integrate MBSE, MBSA and multi-physics modelling activities is provided. Then, after having identified some relevant scientific barriers, we provide a meta-model for system models integration within a digital twin framework. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The requirements for sorbitized wire rod are formulated, the use of which makes it possible to abandon the initial operation of patenting before drawing. The features of heat transfer on the line of accelerated air cooling of wire rod and round steel with a diameter of 5.5 to 11 mm are studied. A mathematical model has been built for calculating the air flow velocity diagrams depending on the switched on fan power, the design of the blast systems and the position of the control dampers. The reasons for the uneven properties of wire rod along the length of the coil are established. A review of the concepts of digital twins regarding their application in the metallurgical industry has been carried out. A comparative analysis of digital twins and SCADA systems is presented. A digital model of the air cooling line has been formed in the AutodeskRevit environment. Experimental and pilot rollings were carried out under the conditions of the operating mill. Samples were taken in characteristic sections of rolled products corresponding to the center, left and right edges of the width of the conveyor of the air cooling line. More than 100 microsections were prepared and studied, as well as more than 150 samples for studying mechanical properties: Tensile strength, relative reduction, relative elongation. The results of processing experimental batches of wire rod in the conditions of drawing production are analyzed. Technical, technological and organizational solutions for the stage-by-stage improvement of wire rod accelerated cooling lines using a digital process model are proposed. © 2022, Ore and Metals Publishing house.

AB  - The overall aim of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm in the built environment by drawing inspiration from existing DT research in manufacturing. The DT is a Product Life Management information construct that has migrated to the built environment while research on the subject has grown intensely in recent years. Common to early research phases, DT research in the built environment has developed organically, setting the basis for mature definitions and robust research frameworks. As DT research in manufacturing is the most developed, this paper seeks to advance the understanding of DTs in the built environment by analysing how the DT systems reported in manufacturing literature are structured and how they function. Firstly, this paper presents a thorough review and a comparison of DT, cyber-physical systems (CPS), and building information modelling (BIM). Then, the results of the review and categorisation of DT structural and functional descriptions are presented. Fifty-four academic publications and industry reports were reviewed, and their structural and functional descriptions were analysed in detail. Three types of structural models (i.e. conceptual models, system architectures, and data models) and three types of functional models (process and communication models) were identified. DT maturity models were reviewed as well. From the reviewed descriptions, four categories of DT conceptual models (prototypical, model-based, interface-oriented, and service-based) and six categories of DT process models (DT creation, DT synchronisation, asset monitoring, prognosis and simulation, optimal operations, and optimised design) were defined and its applicability to the AECO assessed. While model-based and service-based models are the most applicable to the built environment, amendments are still required. Prognosis and simulation process models are the most widely applicable for AECO use-cases. The main contribution to knowledge of this study is that it compiles the DT's structural and functional descriptions used in manufacturing and it provides the basis to develop DT conceptual and process models specific to requirements of the built environment sectors. © 2021

AB  - This paper analyzes the ability of different machine learning techniques, able to operate in the low-data limit, for constructing the model linking material and process parameters with the properties and performances of parts obtained by reactive polymer extrusion. The use of data-driven approaches is justified by the absence of reliable modeling and simulation approaches able to predict induced properties in those complex processes. The experimental part of this work is based on the in situ synthesis of a thermoset (TS) phase during the mixing step with a thermoplastic polypropylene (PP) phase in a twin-screw extruder. Three reactive epoxy/amine systems have been considered and anhydride maleic grafted polypropylene (PP-g-MA) has been used as compatibilizer. The final objective is to define the appropriate processing conditions in terms of improving the mechanical properties of these new PP materials by reactive extrusion. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Rising demands for biopharmaceuticals and the need to reduce manufacturing costs increase the pressure to develop productive and efficient bioprocesses. Among others, a major hurdle during process development and optimization studies is the huge experimental effort in conventional design of experiments (DoE) methods. As being an explorative approach, DoE requires extensive expert knowledge about the investigated factors and their boundary values and often leads to multiple rounds of time-consuming and costly experiments. The combination of DoE with a virtual representation of the bioprocess, called digital twin, in model-assisted DoE (mDoE) can be used as an alternative to decrease the number of experiments significantly. mDoE enables a knowledge-driven bioprocess development including the definition of a mathematical process model in the early development stages. In this chapter, digital twins and their role in mDoE are discussed. First, statistical DoE methods are introduced as the basis of mDoE. Second, the combination of a mathematical process model and DoE into mDoE is examined. This includes mathematical model structures and a selection scheme for the choice of DoE designs. Finally, the application of mDoE is discussed in a case study for the medium optimization in an antibody-producing Chinese hamster ovary cell culture process.

AB  - Climate change is driving the transformation of energy systems from fossil to renewable energies. In industry, power supply systems and electro-mobility, the need for electrical energy storage is rising sharply. Lithium-based batteries are one of the most widely used technologies. Operating parameters must be determined to control the storage system within the approved operating limits. Operating outside the limits, i.e., exceeding or falling below the permitted cell voltage, can lead to faster aging or destruction of the cell. Accurate cell information is required for optimal and efficient system operation. The key is high-precision measurements, sufficiently accurate battery cell and system models, and efficient control algorithms. Increasing demands on the efficiency and dynamics of better systems require a high degree of accuracy in determining the state of health and state of charge (SOC). These scientific contributions to the above topics are divided into two parts. In the first part of the paper, a holistic overview of the main SOC assessment methods is given. Physical measurement methods, battery modeling, and the methodology of using the model as a digital twin of a battery are addressed and discussed. In addition, adaptive methods and artificial intelligence methods that are important for SOC calculation are presented. Part two of the paper presents examples of the application areas and discusses their accuracy.  © 2022. The Author(s).

AB  - In pharmaceutical manufacturing, the utmost aim is reliably producing high quality products. Simulation approaches allow virtual experiments of processes in the planning phase and the implementation of digital twins in operation. The industrial processing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) into tablets requires the combination of discrete and continuous sub-processes with complex interdependencies regarding the material structures and characteristics. The API and excipients are mixed, granulated if required, and subsequently tableted. Thereby, the structure as well as the properties of the intermediate and final product are influenced by the raw materials, the parametrized processes and environmental conditions, which are subject to certain fluctuations. In this study, for the first time, an agent-based simulation model is presented, which enables the prediction, tracking, and tracing of resulting structures and properties of the intermediates of an industrial tableting process. Therefore, the methodology for the identification and development of product and process agents in an agent-based simulation is shown. Implemented physical models describe the impact of process parameters on material structures. The tablet production with a pilot scale rotary press is experimentally characterized to provide calibration and validation data. Finally, the simulation results, predicting the final structures, are compared to the experimental data. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This paper aims at introducing the main technologies enabling the construction of physicsaware digital twins, the so-called Hybrid Twins™, embracing physics-based and data-driven functionalities, both enriching mutually. Both should proceed in almost real-time, and the last being able to proceed in the scarce data limit. When applied to materials, structures and processes, model order reduction technologies enable the construction of parametric solutions (surrogates), whereas data-driven modelling, based in advanced regressions, works with experimental or synthetic data, encompassing rapidity and accuracy, even in the low data limit. This paper describes both the state of the art, as well as an outlook, on the most advanced technologies at the origin of the so-called Hybrid Twin™. In the associated talk, some examples concerning car design, maintenance and operation will be addressed, emphasizing the benefits provided by the tools here described. © 2022 the authors.

AB  - From the perspective of the system of systems development, system-level functional testing is required for designing subsystems. This study utilizes modeling and simulation techniques to analyze the operational behaviors of the subsystems and confirm data communication between them. The targeted system in the study is a naval combat system (NCS), which is a typical type of defense cyber-physical system (CPS). Three types of models were designed for the simulation testing of the NCS: a combat-management model for simulating the overall computational activities, physical models to confirm the intrasubsystem behaviors, and data integration models to test the intersubsystem communications. These models are realized with the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern, which strongly facilitates graphical user interfaces being decoupled from model logic and data. We consider underwater combat scenarios as an application. Six significant physical subsystems within the NCS are simulated and tested: a ship-steering system, an inertial navigation system, a global navigation satellite system, a periscope, sonar systems, and a plotting board. We expect that the proposed work will play a principal role when analyzing the behaviors and communications of defense CPSs and providing an environment for functional testing as a digital twin. © 2022 Dong-Chul Lee et al.

AB  - Crystallization is the main thermal process resulting in the formation of solid products and, therefore, is widely spread in all kinds of industries, from fine chemicals to foods and drugs. For these high-performance products, a quality by design (QbD) approach is applied to maintain high product purity and steady product parameters. In this QbD-context, especially demanded in the foods and drugs industry, the significance of models to deepen process understanding and moving toward automated operation is steadily rising. To reach these aspired goals, besides major process influences like crystallization temperature, other impacting parameters have to be evaluated and a model describing these influences is sought-after. In this work, the suitability of a population balance-based physico-chemical process model for the production of sugar is investigated. A model overview is given and the resulting model is compared to a statistical DoE scheme. The resulting process model is able to picture the effects of secondary process parameters, alongside temperature or temperature gradients, the influences of seed crystal size and amount, stirrer speed, and additives. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Digital Twins (DTs) are receiving considerable attention from multiple disciplines. Much of the literature at this time is dedicated to the conceptualization of digital twins, and associated enabling technologies and challenges. In this paper, we consider these propositions for the specific application of nuclear power. Our review finds that the current DT concepts are amenable to nuclear power systems, but benefit from some modifications and enhancements. Further, some areas of the existing modeling and simulation infrastructure around nuclear power systems are adaptable to DT development, while more recent efforts in advanced modeling and simulation are less suitable at this time. For nuclear power applications, DT development should rely first on mechanistic model-based methods to leverage the extensive experience and understanding of these systems. Model-free techniques can then be adopted to selectively, and correctively, augment limitations in the model-based approaches. Challenges to the realization of a DT are also discussed, with some being unique to nuclear engineering, however most are broader. A challenging aspect we discuss in detail for DTs is the incorporation of uncertainty quantification (UQ). Forward UQ enables the propagation of uncertainty from the digital representations to predict behavior of the physical asset. Similarly, inverse UQ allows for the incorporation of data from new measurements obtained from the physical asset back into the DT. Optimization under uncertainty facilitates decision support through the formal methods of optimal experimental design and design optimization that maximize information gain, or performance, of the physical asset in an uncertain environment. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Reductionism and splitting application domain into disciplines and identify the smallest required model-granules, termed “basic entity” combined with systematic construction of the behaviour equations for the basic entities, yields a systematic approach to process modelling. We do not aim toward a single modelling domain, but we enable to address specific application domains and object inheritance. We start with reductionism and demonstrate how the basic entities are depending on the targeted application domain. We use directed graphs to capture process models, and we introduce a new concept, which we call “tokens” that enables us to extend the context beyond physical systems. The network representation is hierarchical so as to capture complex systems. The interacting basic entities are defined in the leave nodes of the hierarchy, making the overall model the interacting networks in the leave nodes. Multi-disciplinary and multi-scale models result in a network of networks. We identify two distinct network communication ports, namely ports that exchange tokens and ports that transfer information of tokens in accumulators. An ontology captures the structural elements and the applicable rules and defines the syntax to establish the behaviour equations. Linking the behaviours to the basic entities defines the alphabet of a graphical language. We use this graphical language to represent processes, which has proven to be efficient and valuable. A set of three examples demonstrates the power of the graphical language. The Process Modelling framework (ProMo) implements the ontology-centred approach to process modelling and uses the graphical language to construct process models. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Industrial process modeling is currently undergoing a fundamental transformation, leading towards interconnected close-loop twins of models, i.e., the parametrically-controlled real-world physics model, and its corresponding digitalized virtual system model. Between these models, a highly time-sensitive mutual validation mechanism and a coherent and consistent control strategy are applied, which demand complex virtual-and-real world model-based information mapping and synchronization. Thus, this research proposes a semantic conceptual framework for industrial process modeling in the context of digital twins. Based on a hierarchical structure of digital twins, this framework modularizes the modeling process in terms of the semantic information modules of physics in the real-world phenomena, and clarifies inter-module associations and near-real-time data transmission coupled with virtual analysis in CAE environment so that the time-sensitive phenomenon information objects distributed on virtually-separated sub-level physics models can be supported for representing the real-world process comprehensively. Advanced feature concept is adopted to construct the digital models as the basic compositions of any virtual industrial process. The related feature definitions are extended in this work so that the common characteristics in the concept of digital twins could be generically and concisely represented. To validate the modeling method, the digital model of a prototyped High-velocity Oxygen-fuel (HVOF) coating process system was constructed as the case study. The data from the nozzle trajectory, the flame, and the in-flight particle behavior, and the transient thermal performance of the coating layer and substrate were synchronously incorporated for simulating the transient phenomena of the substrate component temperature and coating thickness distribution on the substrate surface. The final simulation result validates that the feature-based digital model is able to comprehensively reflect the real-world scenario on the virtual side. To illustrate how the developed model provides meaningful feedback to the real-world control, a general digital twin setup of the model is given at the end of the case study. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, more manufacturing enterprises are building automated flexible production lines (AFPLs) to satisfy the dynamic and diversified demand. Currently, static planning methods can hardly meet the requirements of the dynamic resource allocation for AFPLs. The technologies of the digital twin can help solve dynamic problems. Therefore, we propose a data-driven cloud simulation architecture for AFPLs in smart factories. First, we design a cloud simulation platform as the architecture foundation. Second, we use the data-driven modelling and simulation method to achieve automated modelling. Third, we implement the system on the cloud using Java, MySQL, and the Anylogic platform, and verify the efficiency of the proposed method by experiments in the real workshop of a 3C (Computer, Communication, Consumer electronics) company. The experimental results show the proposed architecture can support the real-time resource allocation decisions to maximise the throughput in AFPLs. This paper makes contributions by proposing an architecture realising automatic modelling and data-driven simulation first in the cloud simulation environment, and filling the gap of dynamic resource allocation in the research of AFPLs. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - An efficient and all-inclusive health management encompassing condition-based maintenance (CBM) environment plays a pivotal role in enhancing the useful life of mission-critical systems. Leveraging high fidelity digital modelling and simulation, scalable to digital twin (DT) representation, quadruples their performance prediction and health management regime. The work presented in this paper does exactly the same for an electric braking system (EBS) of a more-electric aircraft (MEA) by developing a highly representative digital model of its electro-mechanical actuator (EMA) and integrating it with the digital model of anti-skid braking system (ABS). We have shown how, when supported with more-realistic simulation and the application of a qualitative validation approach, various fault modes (such as open circuit, circuit intermittence, and jamming) are implemented in an EMA digital model, followed by their impact assessment. Substantial performance degradation of an electric braking system is observed along with associated hazards as different fault mode scenarios are introduced into the model. With the subsequent qualitative validation of an EMA digital model, a complete performance as well as reliability profile of an EMA can be built to enable its wider deployment and safe integration with a larger number of aircraft systems to achieve environmentally friendly objectives of the aircraft industry. Most significantly, the qualitative validation provides an efficient method of identifying various fault modes in an EMA through rapid monitoring of associated sensor signals and their comparative analysis. It is envisaged that when applied as an add-on in digital twin environment, it would help enhance its CBM capability and improve the overall health management regime of electric braking systems in more-electric aircraft. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - This contribution presents a model for cyber-resilience of critical cyber infrastructures (CCI) based on the implementation of a digital twin. It addresses the risks associated with the integration of computational, communication and physical aspects of CCIs. We focus specifically on cybersecurity in the electric power sector due both to its salience and to the potential risks associated to failures in guaranteeing resilience. Informed by the literature on information security management, situational awareness (SA) and common operational picture (COP), we derive an overarching model to provide CCIs’ actors with increased cyber situational awareness, common understanding of incidents and enhanced response capacity. On the practical side, the model seeks to minimize response time and to reduce the impact of cyber-attacks on the organizations and on society as a whole. We develop a process model and validate three design propositions through a formative evaluation in the context of a digital twin implementation in the EU electrical power sector. We discuss the implications of this model for further research as well as practical applications for the electrical power sector. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Continuous plastics compounding processes are highly complex from a physicochemical point of view and correspondingly difficult to optimize. Model-based digital twins suitable for this purpose require complex simulation approaches, trained personnel and input variables that are difficult to determine. However, data-based digital twins, which are in principle suitable for this purpose, often fail because of the enormous trial effort which is required to generate a sufficiently large database. To overcome this problem this paper describes a hybrid approach for generating the necessary database for a data-based digital twin. By intelligent combination of real experiments, adaptation of the physical-chemical process model to these few experimental data and subsequent data cloud generation with the adapted process model results in a sufficient data base for the digital twin. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Advances are being made in applying digital twin (DT) and human–robot collaboration (HRC) to industrial fields for safe, effective, and flexible manufacturing. Using a DT for human modeling and simulation enables ergonomic assessment during working. In this study, a DT-driven HRC system was developed that measures the motions of a worker and simulates the working progress and physical load based on digital human (DH) technology. The proposed system contains virtual robot, DH, and production management modules that are integrated seamlessly via wireless communication. The virtual robot module contains the robot operating system and enables real-time control of the robot based on simulations in a virtual environment. The DH module measures and simulates the worker’s motion, behavior, and physical load. The production management module performs dynamic scheduling based on the predicted working progress under ergonomic constraints. The proposed system was applied to a parts-picking scenario, and its effectiveness was evaluated in terms of work monitoring, progress prediction, dynamic scheduling, and ergonomic assessment. This study demonstrates a proof-of-concept for introducing DH technology into DT-driven HRC for human-centered production systems. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Lyophilization stabilizes formulated biologics for storage, transport and application to patients. In process design and operation it is the link between downstream processing and with final formulation to fill and finish. Recent activities in Quality by Design (QbD) have resulted in approaches by regulatory authorities and the need to include Process Analytical Technology (PAT) tools. An approach is outlined to validate a predictive physical‐chemical (rigorous) lyophilization process model to act quantitatively as a digital twin in order to allow accelerated process design by modeling and to further‐on develop autonomous process optimization and control towards real time release testing. Antibody manufacturing is chosen as a typical example for actual biologics needs. Literature is reviewed and the presented procedure is exemplified to quantitatively and consistently validate the physical‐chemical process model with aid of an experimental statistical DOE (design of experiments) in pilot scale. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - By analyzing the feasibility of the digital twin technology in the assembly of construction machinery, the assembly process of the construction manipulator in the engineering environment is discussed. According to the application criteria and modeling requirements of digital twin, the overall framework of digital twin engineering manipulator assembly modeling and simulation is constructed from three aspects: model layer, data layer, and application layer. According to the operation task characteristics of space engineering manipulator, the feasibility of the control method based on joint angular velocity is analyzed, and the task environment of space engineering manipulator based on Markov model is defined. Aiming at the application of the algorithm in the control task of the space engineering manipulator, a reward function with the addition of the angular velocity soft bound term is designed, which improves the strategy optimization process of the algorithm and obtains a better control effect of the engineering manipulator. The motion trajectory of the end of the engineering manipulator is directly given on the simulation platform, and the expected motion of each joint of the engineering manipulator is calculated through the kinematics of the engineering manipulator. It can be seen from the simulation results that the controllers designed in this study can achieve ideal control effects. With the help of Baxter robot platform, the control algorithm designed in this study is applied to the actual engineering manipulator control, and the effectiveness of the control algorithm is further proved by the actual control effect. © 2022 Hao Guo et al.

AB  - The development of new biologics is becoming more challenging due to global competition and increased requirements for process understanding and assured quality in regulatory approval. As a result, there is a need for predictive, mechanistic process models. These reduce the resources and time required in process development, generating understanding, expanding the possible operating space, and providing the basis for a digital twin for automated process control. Monoclonal antibodies are an important representative of industrially produced biologics that can be used for a wide range of applications. In this work, the validation of a mechanistic process model with respect to sensitivity, as well as accuracy and precision, is presented. For the investigated process conditions, the concentration of glycine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and glutamine have been identified as significant influencing factors for product formation via statistical evaluation. Cell growth is, under the investigated process conditions, significantly dependent on the concentration of glucose within the investigated design space. Other significant amino acids were identified. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to simulate the cultivation run with an optimized medium resulting from the sensitivity analysis. The precision of the model was shown to have a 95% confidence interval. The model shown here includes the implementation of cell death in addition to models described in the literature. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Process planning is the core of guiding process production and one of the most critical parts to realize intelligent manufacturing of products. In order to realize the monitoring, simulation, prediction and control of the physical space in the intelligent manufacturing mode, the digital twin technology is used to guide the process planning. This research describes a modeling method of digital twin process model (DTPM) for manufacturing process and the contents of DT data, discusses the acquisition method of real-time data and the management method of simulation data. Aiming at the data fusion between physical space and virtual space, a hierarchical model and mapping strategy for multi-source heterogeneous data in machining process are proposed to generate the DT data.

AB  - Surrogate Modeling (SM) is often used to reduce the computational burden of time-consuming system simulations. However, continuous advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the spread of embedded sensors have led to the creation of Digital Twins (DT), Design Mining (DM), and Soft Sensors (SS). These methodologies represent a new challenge for the generation of surrogate models since they require the implementation of elaborated artificial intelligence algorithms and minimize the number of physical experiments measured. To reduce the assessment of a physical system, several existing adaptive sequential sampling methodologies have been developed; however, they are limited in most part to the Kriging models and Kriging-model-based Monte Carlo Simulation. In this paper, we integrate a distinct adaptive sampling methodology to an automated machine learning methodology (AutoML) to help in the process of model selection while minimizing the system evaluation and maximizing the system performance for surrogate models based on artificial intelligence algorithms. In each iteration, this framework uses a grid search algorithm to determine the best candidate models and perform a leave-one-out cross-validation to calculate the performance of each sampled point. A Voronoi diagram is applied to partition the sampling region into some local cells, and the Voronoi vertexes are considered as new candidate points. The performance of the sample points is used to estimate the accuracy of the model for a set of candidate points to select those that will improve more the model’s accuracy. Then, the number of candidate models is reduced. Finally, the performance of the framework is tested using two examples to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, dynamic process models have grown even more important in the context of Industry 4.0 and the use of digital twins. However, the accuracy of the corresponding model parameter estimates is determined by the quantity and quality of data and the parameter identification solving methodologies used. Standard methods are based on the ordinary least squares framework. Still, other options are available that might be more sensitive to model parameter variations and ensure more precise parameter estimates. The paper presents a novel technique for parameter identification based on incorporating neural ordinary differential equations for surrogate modeling and differential flatness, i.e., a systems theory concept in control engineering. This approach may lead to improved parameter sensitivities, as demonstrated with a simulation study of a distributed-parameter identification problem assuming a diffusion-type parabolic partial differential equation. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Thermal power plants gather large energy infrastructure; therefore, massive historical and real-time data of equipment operation will be generated in daily operation. Digital industrialization puts forward higher requirements for the use of big data than simple tasks, such as generating reports. MWorks is a multidomain unified modeling and simulation platform based on the Modelica language. In this study, MWorks is used to realize the modeling of multidomain systems, including electrical, thermal, mechanical, fluid, and heat transfer, in power plants. The test, calibration, verification, parameter optimization, and fault diagnosis of the thermal power plant mathematical models, which are historical and real-time data-driven, are discussed. The technology of three-flow fusion, including material flow, energy flow, and information flow, and its application in thermal power digital twin are explored.  © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Patient-specific cardiac models are now being used to guide therapies. The increased use of patient-specific cardiac simulations in clinical care will give rise to the development of virtual cohorts of cardiac models. These cohorts will allow cardiac simulations to capture and quantify inter-patient variability. However, the development of virtual cohorts of cardiac models will require the transformation of cardiac modelling from small numbers of bespoke models to robust and rapid workflows that can create large numbers of models. In this review, we describe the state of the art in virtual cohorts of cardiac models, the process of creating virtual cohorts of cardiac models, and how to generate the individual cohort member models, followed by a discussion of the potential and future applications of virtual cohorts of cardiac models.

AB  - With the focus of smart construction project management, this paper presents a closed-loop digital twin framework under the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), and data mining (DM) techniques. To be specific, IoT connects the physical and cyber world to capture real-time data for modeling and analyzing, and data mining methods incorporated in the virtual model aim to discover hidden knowledge in collected data. The proposed digital twin has been verified in a practical BIM-based project. Based on large inspection data from IoT devices, the 4D visualization and task-centered or worker-centered process model are built as the virtual model to simulate both the task execution and worker cooperation. Then, the high-fidelity virtual model is investigated by process mining and time series analysis. Results show that possible bottlenecks in the current process can be foreseen using the fuzzy miner, while the number of finished tasks in the next phase can be predicted by the multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) model. Consequently, tactic decision-making can realize to not only prevent possible failure in advance, but also arrange work and staffing reasonably to make the process adapt to changeable conditions. In short, the significance of this paper is to build a data-driven digital twin framework integrating with BIM, IoT, and data mining for advanced project management, which can facilitate data communication and exploration to better understand, predict, and optimize the physical construction operations. In future works, more complex cases with multiple data streams will be used to test the developed framework, and more detailed interpretations with the actual observations of construction activities will be given. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Model-based definitions (MBDs) aim to capture both geometric and non-geometric data in digital product definitions using 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models, as a form of product definition baseline, to disseminate product information across different stages of the lifecycle. MBDs can potentially eliminate error-prone information exchange associated with traditional paper-based drawings and improve the fidelity of component details, captured using 3D CAD models. A component's behavior during its lifecycle stages influences its downstream performance, and if included within the MBD of a part, could be used to forecast performance upfront during the design and explore newer designs to enhance performance. However, current CAD capabilities limit associating behavioral information with the component's shape definition. This paper presents a CAD-based tool to store and retrieve metadata using point objects within a CAD model, creating linkages to spatial locations within the component. The tool is illustrated for storage and retrieval of bulk residual stresses developed during the manufacturing of a turbine disk acquired from process modeling and characterization. Further, variations in residual stress distribution owing to process model uncertainties have been captured as separate instances of the disk's CAD models to represent part-to-part variability as an analogy to track individual serialized components for digital twins. The propagation of varying residual stresses from these CAD models within the damage tolerance analysis performed at critical locations in the disk has been demonstrated. The combination of geometric and non-geometric data inside the MBD, via storage of spatial and feature varying information, presents opportunities to create digital twin(s) of actual component(s). © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

AB  - A cyber-physical system (CPS) is a new trend in smart manufacturing-related research, where the physical system acts as a data access role with sensors and communication systems to collect real-world information and communicate to computation modules (i.e. cyber layer), which further analyse and notify the findings to the corresponding physical systems through multiple feedback loops. This paper develops a conceptual framework for a new paradigm called smart factory based on CPS by applying virtual-real mapping and fusion, digital twin, big data-driven, virtualisation, and edge-to-cloud service technology to the manufacturing system. The definitions, characteristics, architectures and previous case studies on smart factory based on CPS are explained in detail. In the paradigm, the digital twin merges the physical system modelling and cyberspace simulation to provide an intelligence solution simulation analysis ability. This generates a variety of digital designs of production processes, quality, cost, efficiency and environmental impact analysis about smart factory business mode in the preproduction phase based on big data which can be analysed, and provide authoritative solutions for actual physical space. The proposed system is applied and validated in a real case study from the circuit breaker production industry. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Aims: Post-procedure conduction abnormalities (CA) remain a common complication of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), highlighting the need for personalized prediction models. We used machine learning (ML), integrating statistical and mechanistic modelling to provide a patient-specific estimation of the probability of developing CA after TAVI. Methods and results: The cohort consisted of 151 patients with normal conduction and no pacemaker at baseline who underwent TAVI in nine European centres. Devices included CoreValve, Evolut R, Evolut PRO, and Lotus. Preoperative multi-slice computed tomography was performed. Virtual valve implantation with patient-specific computer modelling and simulation (CM&S) allowed calculation of valve-induced contact pressure on the anatomy. The primary composite outcome was new onset left or right bundle branch block or permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) before discharge. A supervised ML approach was applied with eight models predicting CA based on anatomical, procedural and mechanistic data. CA occurred in 59% of patients (n = 89), more often after mechanical than first or second generation self-expanding valves (68% vs. 60% vs. 41%). CM&S revealed significantly higher contact pressure and contact pressure index in patients with CA. The best model achieved 83% accuracy (area under the curve 0.84) and sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and F1-score of 100%, 62%, 76%, 100%, and 82%. Conclusion: ML, integrating statistical and mechanistic modelling, achieved an accurate prediction of CA after TAVI. This study demonstrates the potential of a synergetic approach for personalizing procedure planning, allowing selection of the optimal device and implantation strategy, avoiding new CA and/or PPI. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Autonomous ships are expected to change water-based transport of both cargo and people, and large investments are being made internationally. There are many reasons for such transformation and interest, including shifting transport of goods from road to sea, reducing ship manning costs, reduced dangerous exposure for crew, and reduced environmental impact. Situational awareness (SA) systems and Autonomous navigation systems (ANS) are key elements of autonomous ships. Safe deployment of ANS will not be feasible based on real-life testing only, but will require large-scale, systematic simulation-based testing in addition to assurance of the development process. DNV GL proposes to use a digital twin, meaning a digital representation of key elements of the autonomous ship as a key tool for simulation-based testing. The digital twin contains comprehensive mathematical models of the ship and its equipment, including all sensors and actuators. The complete simulation-based test system complementing the digital twin should consist of a virtual world to simulate environmental conditions, geographical information and interaction with other maritime traffic. Finally, the test system must include a test management system that controls simulation of the digital twin and the virtual world, generates test scenarios as well as evaluates the test scenario results. An automatic scenario generation tool should search for low ANS performance, and ultimately establish sufficient coverage of the possible scenario space. The test scenario evaluation should automatically consider safety, conformance to collision regulations at sea (COLREG), and possibly also the efficiency of the ship navigation. This paper presents a comprehensive prototype of a test system for ANS. Key topics are simulation-based testing, interfacing the simulator and ANS, cooperation with ANS manufacturers, dynamic test scenario generation, automatic assessment towards COLREG and experiences from the cooperation with The Norwegian Defense Establishment (FFI). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - High-performance aerospace component manufacturing requires stringent in-process geometrical and performance-based quality control. Real-time observation, understanding and control of machining processes are integral to optimizing the machining strategies of aerospace component manufacturing. Digital Twin can be used to model, monitor and control the machining process by fusing multi-dimensional in-context machining process data, such as changes in geometry, material properties and machining parameters. However, there is a lack of systematic and efficient Digital Twin modeling method that can adaptively develop high-fidelity multi-scale and multi-dimensional Digital Twins of machining processes. Aiming at addressing this challenge, we proposed a Digital Twin modeling method based on biomimicry principles that can adaptively construct a multi-physics digital twin of the machining process. With this approach, we developed multiple Digital Twin sub-models, e.g., geometry model, behavior model and process model. These Digital Twin sub-models can interact with each other and compose an integrated true representation of the physical machining process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed biomimicry-based Digital Twin modeling method, we tested the method in monitoring and controlling the machining process of an air rudder. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers

AB  - Machining plan is the core of guiding manufacturing production and is regarded as one of the keys to ensure the quality of product processing. Existing process design methods are inefficient to quickly handle the machining plan changed induced by the unpredictable events in real-time production. It inevitably causes time and economic losses for the enterprise. In order to express the evolutionary characteristics of product processing, the construction method of digital twin process model (DTPM) is proposed based on the knowledge-evolution machining features. Three key technologies include correlation structure of process knowledge, expression method of the evolution geometric features and the association mechanism between two are solved. On this basis, the construction framework of DTPM is illustrated. Then, the organisation and management mechanism of multi-source heterogeneous data is discussed in detail. At last, a case study of the complex machined part is researched, the results show that the processing time reduced by about 7% and the processing stability improved by 40%. Meanwhile, the implementation scheme, application process and effect of this case are described in detail to provide reference for enterprises. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Modelling and simulation of spatially or temporally varying geo-data play a pivotal role in the development of digital twins of civil infrastructures and smart cities. Measurements on geo-data are however often sparse, and it is challenging to model or simulate the spatiotemporally varying geo-data directly from sparse measurements. Non-parametric methods are appealing to tackle this challenge because they bypass the difficulty in the selection of suitable parametric models or function forms and offer great flexibility for mimicking complicated characteristics of geo-data in a data-driven manner. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of non-parametric modelling and simulation of spatiotemporally varying geo-data under the framework of spectral representation or compressive sensing/sampling (CS). Similarity and differences between the spectral representation-based methods and the CS-based methods are discussed, including modelling of unknown trend function, marginal probability density function (PDF), and spatial or temporal autocovariance structure. Advantages of the CS-based methods are highlighted, such as superior performance for sparse measurements (i.e. capable of dealing with a sampling frequency lower than Nyquist frequency) and incorporation of the uncertainty associated with the interpretation of sparse measurements. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate both spectral representation-based methods and CS-based methods. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Aiming at the practical engineering application problems such as the disconnection of assembly model, data and information, the inaccurate accuracy prediction, and lack of effective guidance for field assembly during the assembly of complex products, a model expression and accuracy prediction method of digital twin-based assembly model for complex products were proposed. The overall process of assembly accuracy prediction for complex products based on digital twin was given. The digital twin-based assembly model was divided into digital twin-based assembly object model and digital twin-based assembly process model, and the accurate modeling mechanism of product digital twin-based assembly model was clarified. On this basis, by the update and iteration mechanism of assembly deviation transfer based on measuring data, the product assembly error analysis and assembly accuracy prediction that integrate multi-dimensional error sources were used to be realized. Taking a certain type of satellite structure assembly as example, the corresponding software and hardware system platform of digital twin assembly for complex products was built, and the feasibility of the above method was verified through an example, which provided a feasible new idea and new way for assembly accuracy prediction and assurance for complex products. © 2021, Editorial Department of CIMS.

AB  - Citizen sensing applications need to have a number of users defined that ensures their effectiveness. This is not a straightforward task because neither the relationship between the size of the userbase or its effectiveness is easily quantified, nor is it clear which threshold for the number of users would make the application ‘effective’. This paper presents an approach for estimating the number of users needed for location‐based crowdsourcing applications to work successfully, depending on the use case, the circumstances, and the criteria of success. It circumvents various issues, ethical or practical, in performing real‐world controlled experiments and tackles this challenge by developing an agent‐based modelling and simulation framework. This framework is tested on a specific scenario, that of missing children and the search for them. The search is performed with the contribution of citizens being made aware of the disappearance through a mobile application. The result produces an easily reconfigurable testbed for the effectiveness of citizen sensing mobile applications, allowing the study of the marginal utility of new users of the application. The resulting framework aims to be the digital twin of a real urban scenario, and it has been designed to be easily adapted and support decisions on the feasibility, evaluation, and targeting of the deployment of spatial crowdsourcing applications. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - With cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence and other new information technologies going into space, the era of space intelligence is coming. The spacecraft is facing more frequent and multi-task tests in an unprecedented complex environment, which set higher requirements for self-management. The current challenge lies in how to further build an integrated system of the virtual and physical space for spacecraft. In this tendency, the integration of Digital twin(DT) with spacecraft is also in its evolutionary trend. DT provides a data and model-based systematic approach for operation and management in the entire service life of on-orbit spacecraft. In this context, as a basic space system entity, the method of constructing DT of spacecraft is explored in this paper. Firstly, the concept of Spacecraft Digital twin (SDT) is put forward and four stages of simulation development are discussed from the perspective of DT. Moreover, the conceptual structure of four-dimensional model is proposed to adapt spatial distribution. After that, the key problems of SDT are discussed, including data acquisition, system configuration, and data service model. Accordingly, the future intelligent applications of spacecraft based on DT in autonomous cognition, autonomous operation and maintenance, as well as cluster collaboration are presented respectively. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The demand on biologics has been constantly rising over the past decades and has become crucial in modern medicine. Promising approaches to cope with widespread diseases like cancer and diabetes are gene therapy, plasmid DNA, virus-like particles, and exosomes. Due to progress that has been made in upstream processing (USP), difficulties arise in downstream processing and demand for innovative solutions. This work focuses on the integration of precipitation using a quality by design (QbD) approach for process development. Selective precipitation is achieved with PEG 4000 resulting in an HCP depletion of =80% respectively to IgG. Dissolution was executed with a sodium phosphate buffer (pH = 5/50 mM) reaching an IgG recovery of =95%. However, the central challenge in process development is still an optimal process design, which is transferable for a broad molecular variety of new products. This is where rigorous modeling becomes vital in order to generate digital twins to support early-stage process development and reduce the experimental overhead. Therefore, a model development and validation concept for construction of a process model for precipitation is also presented. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The emerging demand for advanced structural and biological materials calls for novel modeling tools that can rapidly yield high-fidelity estimation on materials properties in design cycles. Lattice spring model, a coarse-grained particle spring network, has gained attention in recent years for predicting the mechanical properties and giving insights into the fracture mechanism with high reproducibility and generalizability. However, to simulate the materials in sufficient detail for guaranteed numerical stability and convergence, most of the time a large number of particles are needed, greatly diminishing the potential for high-throughput computation and therewith data generation for machine learning frameworks. Here, we implement CuLSM, a GPU-accelerated compute unified device architecture C++ code realizing parallelism over the spring list instead of the commonly used spatial decomposition, which requires intermittent updates on the particle neighbor list. Along with the image-to-particle conversion tool Img2Particle, our toolkit offers a fast and flexible platform to characterize the elastic and fracture behaviors of materials, expediting the design process between additive manufacturing and computer-aided design. With the growing demand for new lightweight, adaptable, and multi-functional materials and structures, such tailored and optimized modeling platform has profound impacts, enabling faster exploration in design spaces, better quality control for 3D printing by digital twin techniques, and larger data generation pipelines for image-based generative machine learning models.

AB  - Currently, Kenya supplies its energy demand predominantly through hydroelectric power, which fluctuates due to poor and unpredictable rainfall in particular years. Geothermal energy is proposed as a clean and reliable energy source in meeting Kenya’s increasing energy demand. During geothermal drilling operations, disruptions due to tool wear and breakages increases the cost of operation significantly. Some of these causes can be mitigated by real-time monitoring of the tool head during operations. This paper presents the design and implementation of a digital twin model of a drilling tool head, represented as a section of a mechatronic assembly system. The system was modelled in Siemens NX and programmed via the TIA portal using S7 1200 PLC. The digital model was programmed to exactly match the operations of the physical system using OPC (open platform communications) standards. These operations were verified through the motion study by simultaneous running of the assembly system and digital twin model. The study results substantiate that a digital twin model of a geothermal drilling operation can closely mimic the physical operation. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Maximizing the value of each available data point in bioprocess development is essential in order to reduce the time-to-market, lower the number of expensive wet-lab experiments, and maximize process understanding. Advanced in silico methods are increasingly being investigated to accomplish these goals. Within this contribution, we propose a novel integrated process model procedure to maximize the use of development data to optimize the Stage 1 process validation work flow. We generate an integrated process model based on available data and apply two innovative Monte Carlo simulation-based parameter sensitivity analysis linearization techniques to automate two quality by design activities: determining risk assessment severity rankings and establishing preliminary control strategies for critical process parameters. These procedures are assessed in a case study for proof of concept on a candidate monoclonal antibody bioprocess after process development, but prior to process characterization. The evaluation was successful in returning results that were used to support Stage I process validation milestones and demonstrated the potential to reduce the investigated parameters by up to 24% in process characterization, while simultaneously setting up a strategy for iterative updates of risk assessments and process controls throughout the process life-cycle to ensure a robust and efficient drug supply. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In the course of digitalization, the concept of the digital twin (DT) has become increasingly important in recent years. Hereby, initial concept approaches focus on use cases in industrial production. Although the concept has diverse potential for the asset intensive and increasingly important German rail transport sector. Due to the still low level of research of the DT, there are few empirical values on how this promising concept can be implemented in a target‐oriented manner. In a qualitative‐explorative research design, this work focuses on answering the question of how a generic implementation strategy (GIS) of DTs in logistics systems of German rail transport can be designed. The central result of this work is a validated GIS which has a sufficient level of detail for the targeted implementation of DTs. Due to its socio‐technical system focus, this process model enables user‐oriented development and consideration of the complex framework conditions of German rail transport for the first time. The perspective use of the GIS as well as the utilization of the derived recommendations for action contribute to realizing DTs. Consequently, this work is to be regarded as an important instrument for achieving the operational optimization and intelligent management of rail transport assets. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a valuable modality in the diagnosis and characterization of cardiovascular diseases, since it can identify abnormalities in structure and function of the myocardium non-invasively and without the need for ionizing radiation. However, in clinical practice, it is commonly acquired as a collection of separated and independent 2D image planes, which limits its accuracy in 3D analysis. This paper presents a completely automated pipeline for generating patient-specific 3D biventricular heart models from cine magnetic resonance (MR) slices. Our pipeline automatically selects the relevant cine MR images, segments them using a deep learning-based method to extract the heart contours, and aligns the contours in 3D space correcting possible misalignments due to breathing or subject motion first using the intensity and contours information from the cine data and next with the help of a statistical shape model. Finally, the sparse 3D representation of the contours is used to generate a smooth 3D biventricular mesh. The computational pipeline is applied and evaluated in a CMR dataset of 20 healthy subjects. Our results show an average reduction of misalignment artefacts from 1.82 ± 1.60 mm to 0.72 ± 0.73 mm over 20 subjects, in terms of distance from the final reconstructed mesh. The high-resolution 3D biventricular meshes obtained with our computational pipeline are used for simulations of electrical activation patterns, showing agreement with non-invasive electrocardiographic imaging. The automatic methodologies presented here for patient-specific MR imaging-based 3D biventricular representations contribute to the efficient realization of precision medicine, enabling the enhanced interpretability of clinical data, the digital twin vision through patient-specific image-based modelling and simulation, and augmented reality applications.

AB  - A digital twin has recently received considerable attention in various industry domains. The digital twin replicates physical objects (e.g., people, objects, spaces, systems, and processes) in the real world into digital objects in the digital world. It also provides various simulations to solve problems in the real world or to improve situational operations. Therefore, the digital twin is a convergence of various technologies, such as advanced machine-learning algorithms, data analytics, super-resolution visualization and modeling, and simulation. Because the digital twin is a complicated technology, a step-by-step implementation that includes many technology elements should be considered to create a digital twin model. In this study, implementation layers are introduced to guide practical implementations of the digital twin. In addition, technology elements were suggested for the presented implementation layers. Because the suggested technology elements include clear technology definitions, various application domains (e.g., energy, transportation, logistics, environment, manufacturing, and smart cities) can easily utilize the introduced implementation layers and technology elements according to the intended purpose. Furthermore, this paper describes the evolution of digital twins. Digital twin technology has evolved continuously since 2002, when the digital twin concept was first introduced. In the described evolution levels, we show the future aspects of digital twin technology, according to the technological evolution direction. Therefore, the digital twin model can be efficiently created by considering the evolution direction and future aspects by using the suggested digital twin evolution levels.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Transdermal drug delivery systems are a key technology to administer drugs with a high first-pass effect in a non-invasive and controlled way. Physics-based modeling and simulation are on their way to become a cornerstone in the engineering of these healthcare devices since it provides a unique complementarity to experimental data and additional insights. Simulations enable to virtually probe the drug transport inside the skin at each point in time and space. However, the tedious experimental or numerical determination of material properties currently forms a bottleneck in the modeling workflow. We show that multiparameter inverse modeling to determine the drug diffusion and partition coefficients is a fast and reliable alternative. We demonstrate this strategy for transdermal delivery of fentanyl. We found that inverse modeling reduced the normalized root mean square deviation of the measured drug uptake flux from 26 to 9%, when compared to the experimental measurement of all skin properties. We found that this improved agreement with experiments was only possible if the diffusion in the reservoir holding the drug was smaller than the experimentally measured diffusion coefficients suggested. For indirect inverse modeling, which systematically explores the entire parametric space, 30,000 simulations were required. By relying on direct inverse modeling, we reduced the number of simulations to be performed to only 300, so a factor 100 difference. The modeling approach’s added value is that it can be calibrated once in-silico for all model parameters simultaneously by solely relying on a single measurement of the drug uptake flux evolution over time. We showed that this calibrated model could accurately be used to simulate transdermal patches with other drug doses. We showed that inverse modeling is a fast way to build up an accurate mechanistic model for drug delivery. This strategy opens the door to clinically ready therapy that is tailored to patients. © Copyright © 2021 Defraeye, Bahrami and Rossi.

AB  - A generic well-defined methodology for the construction and operation of dynamic process models of discrete industrial systems following a number of well-defined steps is introduced. The sequence of steps for the application of the method as well as the necessary inputs, conditions, con-straints and the results obtained are defined. The proposed methodology covers the classical offline modelling and simulation applications as well as their online counterpart, which use the physical system in the context of digital twins, with extensive data exchange and interaction with sensors, actuators and tools from other scientific fields as analytics and optimisation. The implemented process models can be used for what-if analysis, comparative evaluation of alternative scenarios and for the calculation of key performance indicators describing the behaviour of the physical systems under given conditions as well as for online monitoring, management and adjustment of the physical industrial system operations with respect to given rules and targets. An application of the proposed methodology in a discrete industrial system is presented, and interesting conclusions arise and are discussed. Finally, the open issues, limitations and future extensions of the research are considered. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In recent years, the concept of digital twin (DT) is attracting more and more attention from researchers and engineers. But there is still no consensus on what a right DT is. On one hand, some common models are renamed as DTs. On the other hand, some DTs extremely pursue ‘the same’ as physical objects, which bring unnecessary complexities to them. In this paper, we try to answer two questions from the point of view of model engineering: how to define a right digital twin, and how to build a right digital twin. The concept and related technologies of model engineering are introduced. Some basic principles and a set of metrics for a right DT are given. An evolutionary concurrent modeling method for DT (ECoM4DT) is proposed not only inheriting the theory from classic M&S methods but also highlighting the characteristics of DT compared with traditional models to systemically guide the DT modeling process. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers

AB  - A future-oriented approach is the application of Digital Twins for process development, optimization and finally during manufacturing. Digital Twins are detailed virtual representations of bioprocesses with predictive capabilities. In biotechnology, Digital Twins can be used to monitor processes and to provide data for process control and optimization. Central and crucial components of Digital Twins are mathematical process models, which are capable to describe and predict cultivations with high fidelity. Detailed mechanistic models in particular are suitable for both use in Digital Twins and for the development of process control strategies.In this chapter the requirements that process models must fulfil in order to be used for process optimization and finally in Digital Twins will be described. Different types of models, including mechanistic as well as compartmentalized models, are outlined and their application in Digital Twins and for process optimization is explained.

AB  - With the increasing panoramic information of load, weather, equipment, electricity-gas-heat multi-energy flow in the power system operation, it is difficult for the traditional power system modeling and simulation technology to adapt to the needs of future intelligent energy system operation control. The digital twin technology combined with machine learning, communication network, high-performance analysis and calculation, and internet of things can effectively solve this technical problem. Firstly, according to the basic definition and application scenarios of digital twin technology in different fields at home and abroad, this paper discusses the construction modes and the future development ideas of digital twin technology for a smart energy system, and designs the digital twin and multi-agent control architecture of the smart microgrid considering multi communication protocol interaction. Considering the physical space, the digital space and their coupling relationship, this paper decomposes the whole life cycle management process of the smart microgrid, and constructs the regulation resource agent, the regulation process agent and the regulation service agent. Then, it constructs the digital and physical twin of the system, and uses the twin data of the distributed components and the surrounding environment collected by the sensors to update the database. Finally, the smart microgrid test model based on the Opal-RT hardware in the loop simulation platform is constructed, and the UDP(user datagram protocol) is used to sense the test data in real time to verify the control strategy proposed in this paper in the two working scenarios of microgrid grid connection and island. The results show that the smart microgrid is implemented in the actual system according to the optimized test scheme of the digital twin, and the implementation interacts with the digital twin system in real time to provide the operation guidance for the whole life cycle management. © 2021, Power System Technology Press.

AB  - A digital twin of pharmaceutical quality control laboratory was developed and employed as a benchmarking platform to estimate the performance of a new facility under alternative governance models. Key performance metrics, such as sample processing times and utilisation rates of analytical staff and equipment were computed and compared under alternative governance scenarios, to determine solutions to be implemented in practice. Two frameworks were evaluated, leading to the conclusion that higher efficiency can be achieved under a novel, free-for-all governance, without the need to procure additional resources. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Traditional extraction processes of natural product are widespread, especially in regulated industries. Possibilities of extraction development and manufacturing optimization in regulated industries is limited. Regulatory approvals are often based on traditional preparations of phyto-pharmaceuticals. The dependence on traditional processes can result in sub-optimal extraction parameters causing unnecessary costs and product variability. Innovative methods like Quality-by-Design (QbD), including process analytical technology (PAT), open opportunities for manufacturers to cope with regulatory demanded, narrow batch-to-batch variability. In addition, such validated process models represent perfect digital twins which could be utilized for advanced process control and life cycle analysis. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - We present our recent development of an integrated mesoscale digital twin (DT) framework for relating processing conditions, microstructures, and mechanical responses of additively manufactured (AM) metals. In particular, focusing on the laser powder bed fusion technique, we describe how individual modeling and simulation capabilities are coupled to investigate and control AM microstructural features at multiple length and time scales. We review our prior case studies that demonstrate the integrated modeling schemes, in which high-fidelity melt pool dynamics simulations provide accurate local thermal profiles and histories to subsequent AM microstructure simulations. We also report our new mechanical response modeling results for predicted AM microstructures. In addition, we illustrate how our DT framework has been validated through modeling–experiment integration, as well as how it has been practically utilized to guide and analyze AM experiments. Finally, we share our perspectives on future directions of further development of the DT framework for more efficient, accurate predictions and wider ranges of applications. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Sensors play an important role in monitoring manufacturing processes and update their digital twins. However, the data transmission bandwidth and sensor placement limitations in the physical systems may not allow us to collect the amount or the type of data that we wish. Recently, a physics-based compressive sensing (PBCS) approach was proposed to monitor manufacturing processes and obtain high-fidelity information with the reduced number of sensors by incorporating physical models of processes in compressed sensing. It can recover and reconstruct complete three-dimensional temperature distributions based on some limited measurements. In this paper, a constrained orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is developed for PBCS, where coherence exists between the measurement matrix and the basis matrix. The efficiency of recovery is improved by introducing a boundary-domain reduction approach, which reduces the size of PBCS model matrices during the inverse operations. The improved PBCS method is demonstrated with the measurement of temperature distributions in the cooling and real-time printing processes of fused filament fabrication. © 2021 by ASME

AB  - Simulation is a key technology for developing planning and exploratory models to optimize decision making as well as the design and operations of complex and smart production systems. It could also aid companies to evaluate the risks, costs, implementation barriers, impact on operational performance, and roadmap toward Industry 4.0. Although several advances have been made in this domain, studies that systematically characterize and analyze the development of simulation-based research in Industry 4.0 are scarce. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the state-of-the-art research performed on the intersecting area of simulation and the field of Industry 4.0. Initially, a conceptual framework describing Industry 4.0 in terms of enabling technologies and design principles for modeling and simulation of Industry 4.0 scenarios is proposed. Thereafter, literature on simulation technologies and Industry 4.0 design principles is systematically reviewed using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology. This study reveals an increasing trend in the number of publications on simulation in Industry 4.0 within the last four years. In total, 10 simulation-based approaches and 17 Industry 4.0 design principles were identified. A cross-analysis of concepts and evaluation of models’ development suggest that simulation can capture the design principles of Industry 4.0 and support the investigation of the Industry 4.0 phenomenon from different perspectives. Finally, the results of this study indicate hybrid simulation and digital twin as the primary simulation-based approaches in the context of Industry 4.0. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Process Model for Creating Digital Twins for Production and Logistics. The digital twin is an important component of Industry 4.0 and enables applications such as predictive maintenance, virtual prototyping or 3D simulations of entire factories. The problem with the development of the digital twin arises from the lack of standards and norms. There is no universal methodology for structuring the process. The purpose of this article is to present a process model for the creation of a digital twin in the area of production and logistics. The process model helps to classify the use cases for which a digital twin can be developed, which steps must be taken during implementation, and provides an overview of the requirements and complexity of development. The central element is the targeted preparation and analysis of the underlying data using the CRISP-DM process model established in the industry. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston, Germany ISSN 0947-0085 · e-ISSN 2511-0896.

AB  - In recent years process modelling has become an established method which generates digital twins of manufacturing plant operation with the aid of numerically solved process models. This article discusses the benefits of establishing process modelling, in-house or by cooperation, in order to support the workflow from process development, piloting and engineering up to manufacturing. The examples are chosen from the variety of botanicals and biologics manufacturing thus proving the broad applicability from variable feedstock of natural plant extracts of secondary metabolites to fermentation of complex molecules like mAbs, fragments, proteins and peptides.Consistent models and methods to simulate whole processes are available. To determine the physical properties used as model parameters, efficient laboratory-scale experiments are implemented. These parameters are case specific since there is no database for complex molecules of biologics and botanicals in pharmaceutical industry, yet.Moreover, Quality-by-Design approaches, demanded by regulatory authorities, are integrated within those predictive modelling procedures. The models could be proven to be valid and predictive under regulatory aspects. Process modelling does earn its money from the first day of application. Process modelling is a key-enabling tool towards cost-efficient digitalization in chemical-pharmaceutical industries.

AB  - Cyber-physical system (CPS) is a comprehensive technical system that supports the deep integration of information and industrialization. The classical modeling and simulation method fail to satisfy the application requirements of the CPS. Therefore, a digital twin oriented dynamic data driven modeling and simulation method is proposed, and a random finite set (RFS) is used to build the data driven simulation model of physical entities and sensors of CPS. The Bayesian inference based prediction and update method is proposed to run the CPS model. The proposed method can implement the virtual and real combined simulation running for digital twin very well. It can also enable the data driven model running, and improve the accuracy and credibility of simulation results by using the data from the real space. Finally, the feasibility and validity of the proposed method is certified by using the operational application cases of the surface ships. © 2020, Editorial Office of Systems Engineering and Electronics.

AB  - Virtual commissioning is a key technology in Industry 4.0 that can address issues faced by engineers during early design phases. The process of virtual commissioning involves the creation of a Digital Twin—a dynamic, virtual representation of a corresponding physical system. The digital twin model can be used for testing and verifying the control system in a simulated virtual environment to achieve rapid set-up and optimization prior to physical commissioning. Additionally, the modular production control systems, can be integrated and tested during or prior to the construction of the physical system. This paper describes the implementation of a digital twin emulator of an automated mechatronic modular production system that is linked with the running programmable logic controllers and allow for exchanging near real-time information with the physical system. The development and deployment of the digital twin emulator involves a novel hybrid simulation- and data-driven modeling approach that combines Discrete Event Simulation and Agent Based Modeling paradigms. The Digital Twin Emulator can support design decisions, test what-if system configurations, verify and validate the actual behavior of the complete system off-line, test realistic reactions, and provide statistics on the system’s performance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this paper, the interplay and relationship between digital twin and Industrial Internet are discussed at first. The sensing/transmission network capability, which is one of the main characteristics of Industrial Internet, can be a carrier for providing digital twin with a means of data acquisition and transmission. Conversely, with the capability of high-fidelity virtual modeling and simulation computing/analysis, digital twin evolving from lifecycle management for a single product to application in production/manufacturing in the shop-floor/enterprise, can further greatly enhance the simulation computing and analysis of Industrial Internet. This paper proposes a digital twin enhanced Industrial Internet (DT-II) reference framework towards smart manufacturing. To further illustrate the reference framework, the implementation and operation mechanism of DT-II is discussed from three perspectives, including product lifecycle level, intra-enterprise level and inter-enterprise level. Finally, steam turbine is taken as an example to illustrate the application scenes from above three perspectives under the circumstance of DT-II. The differences between with and without DT-II for design and development of steam turbine are also presented. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper addresses the development of a digital twin, based on an inversion procedure, integrating process monitoring with simulation of composites manufacturing to provide a real time probabilistic estimation of process outcomes. A computationally efficient surrogate model was developed based on Kriging. The surrogate model reduces the computational time allowing inversion in real time. The tool was implemented in the filling stage of an resin transfer molding processing of a carbon fiber reinforced part resulting in the probabilistic prediction of unknown parameters. Flow monitoring data were acquired using dielectric sensors. The inverse scheme based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo uses input parameters, such as permeability and viscosity, as unknown stochastic variables. The scheme enhances the model by reducing model parameter uncertainty yielding an accurate on line estimation of process outcomes and critical events such as racetracking. The inverse scheme provides a prediction of filling duration with an error of about 5% using information obtained within the first 30% of the process. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - To fully use the real-time data of the physical workshop to realize the accurate mapping of the data to the virtual workshop and drive the simulation and optimization of the manufacturing system, a data mapping method for the digital twin simulation of production performance is proposed. The fusion process of simulation data and production logic model is analyzed from the aspects of simulation data modeling, storage and updating. Focusing on the production performance simulation requirements, the redundancy analysis, outlier analysis and elimination, statistics and fitting of the original production site sample data is preprocessed. The real-time mapping update process of the simulation data of machine equipment and WIP is given in detail, and the simulation operation, production performance analysis and optimization of the digital twin of production performance are driven. The application process of the approach is showed by a case of a manufacturing workshop, which verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the simulation data mapping method. © 2021, The Editorial Board of Journal of System Simulation.

AB  - Imagine the possibility to save a simulation at any time, modify or analyze it, and restart again with exactly the same state. The conceptualization and its concrete manifestation in the implementation OntologySim is demonstrated in this paper. The presented approach of a fully ontology-based simulation can solve current challenges in modeling and simulation in production science. Due to the individualization and customization of products and the resulting increase in complexity of production, a need for flexibly adaptable simulations arises. This need is exemplified in the trend towards Digital Twins and Digital Shadows. Their application to production systems, against the background of an ever increasing speed of change in such systems, is arduous. Moreover, missing understandability and human interpretability of current approaches hinders successful, goal oriented applications. The OntologySim can help solving this challenge by providing the ability to generate truly cyber physical systems, both interlocked with reality and providing a simulation framework. In a nutshell, this paper presents a discrete-event-based open-source simulation using multi-agency and ontology. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Based on the entire digital coordination transfer process in manufacturing process, with the strategy of 'fusion of virtuality and reality, control the reality with virtuality', the optimization-feedback-improvement loop mechanism of assembly process that driven by digital twin model is studied. Firstly, the essence and technical composition of (1) the quantitative partition/solution/evaluation of assembly unit, (2) the construction of digital twin model, and (3) assembly precision controlling with a closed-loop are analyzed, and the research status and existing problems are summarized. Then considering the detailed constraints of design in virtual field and assembly in physical field, three key technology are proposed, i. e. (1) assembly process planning and evaluation with the thought of DFA, (2) dynamic construction and analysis of twinning process model considering physical topological relation, (3) optimization-feedback-improvement ring mechanism construction orienting for the actual assembly field. Then the specific solutions and possible innovation directions are given. With the above analysis, the connotation of manufacturing technology based on virtual model can be expanded. Finally, the closed-loop optimization decision of production activity and the change of product development mode are expected to be realized in product development and production, and the assembly accuracy/consistency and assembly efficiency can be improved. © 2019 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

AB  - Solar drying is regarded as a less reliable process compared to continuous hot-air drying due to the intermittency of solar radiation. This problem is mitigated by equipping solar dryers with thermal storage, dehumidifier units, or auxiliary heating that enhances drying continuity during night time. In this study, we combine a mechanistic fruit drying model, quality models (vitamin C decay and browning reaction) and weather data to evaluate the drying characteristics and quality evolution of apple fruit with and without the aforementioned improvement strategies. By coupling to measured weather conditions, a digital twin of the drying fruit is established. The twin outputs drying times and final product quality for a specific fruit type and size, a particular dryer configuration, and specific weather conditions. The trade-offs between drying time, final product quality and energy use for the different improvement strategies of solar drying are documented. We found that solar drying may benefit from the slower drying due to the improvement of product quality. Compared to the other improvement strategies, dehumidification of the drying air is shown to be superior in retaining the vitamin C content and prohibiting the browning reaction. However, in general, drying with auxiliary heating is found to balance the trade-offs between drying time, final product quality and energy use since the weather-dependency of the process is mitigated. Additionally, we quantified the impact of a pre-treatment process that modifies the permeability of the fruit tissue by breaking the cell membrane. We found that inducing such lysis is more effective in decreasing the drying time when drying is conducted at low (room) temperature. This study shows that using the developed digital twin, future drying process and control strategies could be optimized in real-time for every single drying run. © Copyright © 2021 Prawiranto, Carmeliet and Defraeye.

AB  - Prediction and control of the product properties in crystallization processes are practical challenges in the pharmaceutical industry. Effective crystallization process design and operation techniques are needed to meet the critical quality attributes (CQAs) and minimize batch-to-batch variation. Mathematical modeling can enhance process understanding and save a considerable amount of time, effort and raw material when used in process development following the guidelines of the Quality-by-Design (QbD) framework. When the mathematical model of the process is fitted and validated with experimental data, it provides a digital twin of the process that enables execution of in silico design of experiments (DoEs), which is particularly beneficial when the number of factors increases or if the material is expensive or sparingly available, e.g., during early stage development. This work presents the benefits of crystallization process modeling by studying an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) from Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., referred hereafter as Compound A. A framework for crystallization model construction, parameter estimation and validation are demonstrated through the case study of Compound A by using the population balance modeling (PBM) approach. Secondary nucleation, size dependent growth (SDG), and size dependent dissolution mechanisms are considered. Size dependency is introduced with a new formulation capturing the considerably slower growth of small crystals (D90 < 10 μm) while having size dependency for the larger crystal size domain (D90 > 200 μm) similar to the models from the literature. To make the model parameter estimation more industrially relevant, a novel method developed recently by the authors is applied to use the focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) data directly in the parameter estimation without further transformations. The kinetic parameters are estimated by minimizing the difference between measured and simulated concentrations, crystal size distributions (CSDs) and maximizing the correlation between the simulated crystal number density and measured FBRM counts. The paper also illustrates that the novel SDG rate expression can capture the CSD dynamics considerably better than the standard SDG rate models. The digital twin is used for in silico DoE and process optimization, and the simulation results are validated experimentally, demonstrating the benefits of model-based digital design for crystallization process development. © 2021 American Chemical Society

AB  - Grinding is a critical technology in the manufacturing of high added-value precision parts, accounting for approximately 20-25% of all machining costs in the industrialized world. It is a commonly used process in the finishing of parts in numerous key industrial sectors such as transport (including the aeronautical, automotive and railway industries), and energy or biomedical industries. As in the case of many other manufacturing technologies, grinding relies heavily on the experience and knowledge of the operatives. For this reason, considerable efforts have been devoted to generating a systematic and sustainable approach that reduces and eventually eliminates costly trial-and-error strategies. The main contribution of this work is that, for the first time, a complete digital twin (DT) for the grinding industry is presented. The required flow of information between numerical simulations, advanced mechanical testing and industrial practice has been defined, thus producing a virtual mirror of the real process. The structure of the DT comprises four layers, which integrate: (1) scientific knowledge of the process (advanced process modeling and numerical simulation); (2) characterization of materials through specialized mechanical testing; (3) advanced sensing techniques, to provide feedback for process models; and (4) knowledge integration in a configurable open-source industrial tool. To this end, intensive collaboration between all the involved agents (from university to industry) is essential. One of the most remarkable results is the development of new and more realistic models for predicting wheel wear, which currently can only be known in industry through costly trial-and-error strategies. Also, current work is focused on the development of an intelligent grinding wheel, which will provide on-line information about process variables such as temperature and forces. This is a critical issue in the advance towards a zero-defect grinding process. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The modeling and simulation results of Collision Warning System (CWS) are difficult to be reacted the real expression of physical domain. As the fusion of information and physical domain, the digital twin provides an opportunity for it. In addition, the existing CWS is limited to in-car warning, and users get less warning information. Aiming at these problem, an extended CWS service architecture was put forward, its composition and operation process were discussed, and its digital twin modeling process was elaborated based on the five-dimensional framework of digital twin. To realize the conceptualization for extended CWS at the functional level, the functional model of extended CWS was carried out based on Theory of Invention Problem Solving (TRIZ) function model. In this way, the functions of the extended CWS could be fully expressed, and an overall solution integrating intelligent products and electronic services could be formed. The Analytic Hierarchy Process-Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (AHP-FCE) was used to evaluate the constructed conceptual scheme. Case study showed that the model could utilize the interactive fusion feature of physical and virtual entity of the digital twin to make the function modeling and development of extended CWS possible at the conceptual level. © 2021, Editorial Department of CIMS.

AB  - Pepper is a humanoid robot capable of expressing body language, perceiving, and interacting with its surrounding environment, thanks to a wide set of sensors and actuators and exposing capabilities and high-level interfaces for natural interaction with humans. In this article, we present the development of VPepper, the Pepper virtual replica, by describing experiences focused on the interaction of the digital twin with the replicas of the smart objects in a smart home. Pepper robot has been featured with arms and hands, but its motors and actuators cannot support intensive experimental sessions and training procedures to learn how safely touch objects. Here, digital twin metaphor plays a crucial role. By a virtual and reliable replica of the robot, machine learning procedures can be seamlessly moved to/from the digital twin with a significant speedup and preventing the physical robot from deterioration. As a practical application, the reported case study is inspired to ambient-assisted living in elderly assistance. The experience, as well as the entire design and development process, has revealed VPepper and the smart environment to offer interesting opportunities for the physical accuracy of the simulation and for the availability of machine learning instruments that may be converted and adopted for real settings. A final empirical evaluation, performed involving 25 volunteer caregivers, confirms the perceived value and the potential usefulness of the system. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - The special mechanisms underneath the flow and transport behaviors in unconventional reservoirs are still challenging an accurate and reliable production estimation. As an emerging approach in intelligent manufacturing, the concept of digital twin has attracted increasing attentions due to its capability of monitoring engineering processes based on modeling and simulation in digital space. The application potential is highly expected especially for problems with complex mechanisms and high data dimensions, because the utilized platform in the digital twin can be easily extended to cover more mechanisms and solve highly complicated problems with strong nonlinearity compared with experimental studies in physical space. In this paper, a digital twin is designed to numerically model the representative mechanisms that affect the production unconventional reservoirs, such as capillarity, dynamic sorption, and injection salinity, and it incorporates multiscale algorithms to simulate and illustrate the effect of these mechanisms on flow and transport phenomena. The preservation of physical laws among different scales is always the first priority, and simulation results are analyzed to verify the robustness of proposed multiscale algorithms.  © 2020 Tao Zhang et al.

AB  - Fast Forward The digital twin is a virtual plant—a dynamic model containing the process, mechanical, and electrical/control design information in one place. Model predictive control provides an additional tool to improve the control of critical processes where PID or rule-based expert control is not well suited. With the digital twin and the process model, coupled with the DCS and the control model, the behavior of the autonomous mill can be analyzed over a range of production rates, operational settings, and constraints.

AB  - Digital twins are virtual replicas of real physical entities in computers. They can be considered as abstract digital models of data and behavior for objects of interest. Nevertheless, they are not perfectly consistent with conventional data or simulation models because they achieve prediction and optimization by simulating the abstract digital model of a particular system. To maintain the characteristics of digital twins in the virtual space, digital simulation models that continue to update, change, and evolve according to continuous changes of corresponding physical factors must be used. Owing to the various advantages of digital twin technology, digital twins have gained more attention. However, the method to create digital twins is still unclear. Additionally, the availability and sufficiency of information on physical entities to which digital twins will be applied must be considered, and a model suitable for their application must be designed. Therefore, multimedia knowledge-based bridge health monitoring using digital twins is proposed herein. It synchronizes real and virtual spaces to reflect the reality based on various data collected using sensors of real systems. In this study, various situations of virtual bridge twins in a facility management area are simulated to provide digital services to ensure bridge health. This digital bridge health service analyzes situations based on a small amount of data collected from a bridge, predicts the optimal time point for maintenance, and then applies it to the real world. Hence, maintenance costs can be reduced and the bridge’s lifespan extended. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Despite great efforts to develop a vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS if untreated, no approved HIV vaccine is available to date. A promising class of vaccines are virus-like particles (VLPs), which were shown to be very effective for the prevention of other diseases. In this study, production of HI-VLPs using different 293F cell lines, followed by a three-step purification of HI-VLPs, was conducted. The quality-by-design-based process development was supported by process analytical technology (PAT). The HI-VLP concentration increased 12.5-fold while >80% purity was achieved. This article reports on the first general process development and optimization up to purification. Further research will focus on process development for polishing and formulation up to lyophilization. In addition, process analytical technology and process modeling for process automation and optimization by digital twins in the context of quality-by-design framework will be developed. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This paper presents a review of the state of the art for digital twins in the application domain of engineering dynamics. The focus on applications in dynamics is because: (i) they offer some of the most challenging aspects of creating an effective digital twin, and (ii) they are relevant to important industrial applications such as energy generation and transport systems. The history of the digital twin is discussed first, along with a review of the associated literature; the process of synthesizing a digital twin is then considered, including definition of the aims and objectives of the digital twin. An example of the asset management phase for a wind turbine is included in order to demonstrate how the synthesis process might be applied in practice. In order to illustrate modeling issues arising in the construction of a digital twin, a detailed case study is presented, based on a physical twin, which is a small-scale three-story structure. This case study shows the progression toward a digital twin highlighting key processes including system identification, data-Augmented modeling, and verification and validation. Finally, a discussion of some open research problems and technological challenges is given, including workflow, joints, uncertainty management, and the quantification of trust. In a companion paper, as part of this special issue, a mathematical framework for digital twin applications is developed, and together the authors believe this represents a firm framework for developing digital twin applications in the area of engineering dynamics. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

AB  - This paper describes the application of a novel virtual prototyping methodology to wind turbine blade design. Numeric modelling data and experimental data about turbine blade geometry and structural/dynamical behaviour are combined to obtain an affordable digital twin model useful in reducing the undesirable uncertainties during the entire turbine lifecycle. Moreover, this model can be used to track and predict blade structural changes, due for example to structural damage, and to assess its remaining life. A new interactive and recursive process is proposed. It includes CAD geometry generation and finite element analyses, combined with experimental data gathered from the structural testing of a new generation wind turbine blade. The goal of the research is to show how the unique features of a complex wind turbine blade are considered in the virtual model updating process, fully exploiting the computational capabilities available to the designer in modern engineering. A composite Sandia National Laboratories Blade System Design Study (BSDS) turbine blade is used to exemplify the proposed process. Static, modal and fatigue experimental testing are conducted at Clarkson University Blade Test Facility. A digital model was created and updated to conform to all the information available from experimental testing. When an updated virtual digital model is available the performance of the blade during operation can be assessed with higher confidence. Copyright © 2019 Techno-Press, Ltd.

AB  - The current paper presents the design of a glass panels recycling flow and the method used for establishing the optimal processing installation architecture. In the solution provided in the current research, a novel approach centred on applying digital twinning in the design of the requested processing architecture is presented. It involves designing the virtual prototype of the diffused processing architecture and modelling the glass waste flow as a hybrid material flow. Dedicated analysis and simulation software is then used for establishing installation architecture and the specific parameters for each processing and transport capacity. The assessment of different processing scenarios by virtual modelling and simulations can also be used for exploring options to increase productivity and profit for other different recycling architectures. The main practical value of the study consists of creating the means to improve the waste recycling of automotive windshields, float glass or construction glass panels with metallic meshes, all representing categories of waste insufficiently recycled in Romania. The simulation results of the study were validated by tests made on the glass panel recycling installation. Also, a recovery glass rate of minimum 85% of the amount of waste loaded into the recycling system was achieved, obtaining a waste recycling quantity three times higher than initially anticipated. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - As smart factories are emerging, the importance of modeling and simulation (MS) continues to increase in the production system. As a result, various commercial tools and environments are provided for production simulation, and manufacturing companies are also applying them to establish a smart manufacturing system. This is used in various ways, such as optimal layout design, scheduling, and fault diagnosis using the acquired smart manufacturing model. However, these model constructions are generally done through a stand-alone environment in which the work type or user level is not considered. It is necessary to use different environments depending on the user level or to rely on MS experts. Therefore, this paper eliminates this inefficiency and proposes an integrative user-level customized smart manufacturing MS environment for all users in the production system. It provides three-phase modeling environments appropriate for the user level, including an automatic model synthesis interface and a production line generator. Using this environment, anyone can easily make capacity and logistic models, and simulate them. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Classic automation control strategies use regulatory controls to maintain process variables at predefined set-points (Al-Rubeai 2015). Regulatory loops such as proportional, proportional-integral, and proportional-integral-derivative, are used to enable feedback control strategies. These control strategies aim to control the process outcome by controlling the process set-points to predefined values and within pre-defined ranges. The pre-defined set-points are locked down under the assumption that they are a global optimal or very close to a global optimal (within equipment constraints). Nevertheless, other sources of variability (such as human intervention, equipment drift, environmental fluctuations and raw material variability) could disturb the manufacturing process leading to deviations from optimal state/conditions. In these cases, it is desirable to re-calculate, in real-time, new optimal conditions to increase, or decrease, a particular process output based on the new disturbed process state. Based on the new conditions, new set-points can be directed to the controller to ensure output optimality within the new state. Control strategies that recalculate new optimal set points based on the process condition use process models at their core and are part of the Advanced Process Control (APC) toolbox. It is advisable that models used to optimize complex processes are either based on first principles, or at least hybrids (i.e. combination between empirical and first principles). Scientifically sound models are critical to ensure control strategy robustness. Generating hybrid models is not trivial as a certain degree of fundamental relationships needs to be translated to mathematical terms and combined with empirical relationships. This paper presents our team efforts to construct a hybrid model to simulate a high titer production bioreactor. © 2019 Russell Publishing LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - Digital Twin technology is considered to be able to achieve the fusion and iterative optimization of product physical model and information model, thus shortening the product development cycle and reducing the cost of rework. Aiming at the problem of poor multi-disciplinary collaboration and high research and development cost of complex products, the concept of digital twin was introduced into the multi-disciplinary collaborative design of complex mechanical products. The research progress of multi-disciplinary collaborative design and digital twin was analyzed, and the information expression, integration and data interaction of digital twin model of product, production and their performance were discussed from the perspective of life cycle, and the evolution process model of digital twin was given. Based on the analysis of multi-stage modeling process of product digital twin, a reference architecture of multi-disciplinary collaborative design modeling for digital twin of product was designed. The method of mechatronics multi-disciplinary collaborative design and virtual engineering and the key technology of multi-disciplinary collaborative design for digital twin of product were proposed. The digital twin model of complex mechanical products was constructed by optimizing simulation and virtual commissioning, which solved the problems of cyber physical fusion of mechanical, electrical and automation multi-disciplinary systems in product life cycle. The feasibility of the proposed digital twin multidisciplinary modeling theory and its optimization method was verified by a case study. © 2019, Editorial Department of CIMS. All right reserved.

AB  - For the production process of cardboard cans, the bottom of the packaging and the paper roll are joined together (flanged and glued) in a flanging process. During this process, the paperboard is plastically deformed and high elongations can occur in the product, which, under unfavourable process conditions, lead to damage of the paperboard surface. By combining a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach with a realistic system simulation (digital twin, FEM simulation) and experimental validation in laboratory tests, the time and cost required to obtain an optimized tool geometry (flanging process) could be significantly reduced. © 2019 Expert Verlag.

AB  - Aiming at the three typical problems in solid rocket motor design such as the separation of solid rocket motor design and simulation, the separation of numerical simulation and physical tests and the difficulty of data unmeasurable, uncertainty and incompletely in ground tests, and to innovate the traditional experience based and semi-experience based mode of solid motor design, a concept system of digital twin of solid rocket motor was established. The digital twin of solid rocket motor was defined from the view of process, model and data. On this basis, a 5-layer architecture model of the digital twin in the design stage of solid rocket motor was established and illustrated. The connotation of each layer was explained, as well as the relationship between layers. According to the conception of process twinning, model twinning and data twinning, the operation mechanism of digital twin was discussed. The formal description of process twinning, model twinning and data twinning was presented. The characteristic of digital twin was analyzed, the possible application method of digital twin in solid rocket design was discussed, and the preliminary realization scheme was given, which provided theoretical reference for future application. © 2019, Editorial Department of CIMS.

AB  - Establishing production environments requires joint decision-making by stakeholders from many disciplines at different levels of aggregation, because of the significant, unpredictable, and risky investments involved. Pilot plants offer a platform to develop, test, improve, and upscale (parts of) a production environment. They consist of physical and virtual components that are integrated, based on the digital twin concept. This concept synthesises sensoring/measurement (in situ and ex situ) with the modelling and simulation of existing and evolving resources/processes at operational, tactical, and strategic levels. Virtual dashboards supplement the pilot plant to provide an insightful basis for decision-making for all the perspectives and stakeholders involved. © 2018, South African Institute of Industrial Engineering.

AB  - As the teeth of CNC machine tools, cutting tools are of great importance to machining efficiency, quality, cost and energy consumption. Precise usage of cutting tools is believed to improve economic, environmental and social benefits greatly. However, the problem that the physical cutting tool was difficult to be reacted by modelling and simulation of its degradation process made the cutting tool usage, replacement and sharpening lack of reliable support, which affected optimization and control for precise usage of cutting tools and dynamic adjustment of machining system. Based on the concept of digital twin, a digital twin model for cutting tools in machining process was proposed, and its concept, structure, function and running procedure were investigated in detail. Digital twin-driven cutting tool wear condition monitoring, remaining useful life prediction, cutting tool selection decision-making and cutting service were also addressed deeply. A prototype was developed to illustrate and validate the model. Through interaction and fusion of physical cutting tools and virtual models, the digital twin model for cutting tools in machining process enabled an intelligent, proactive and predictive cutting tool management mode to support optimization, decision-making and service. © 2019, Editorial Department of CIMS.

AB  - As a key and core technology in aircraft manufacturing industry, assembly coordination technology is important to improve the competitiveness and manufacturing level. To get accurate dimensional size/shape/spatial position and coordination accuracy, according to characteristics of the working mode based on hard master tooling, working mode based on digital coordination model (DCM) is developed. Firstly, with the idea of digital twin, by analyzing the controlling method for coordination accuracy, a principle of the working mode based on DCM is proposed. The defined DCM is a process model that mirrors a practical assembly site, which consists of coordination element (CE), coordination relationship (CR), and control method for coordination accuracy (CMCA). It can replace hard master tooling as the only basis for the transfer process of dimension/shape/position in aircraft manufacturing. Secondly, the principle and detailed function process based on DCM in the whole aircraft manufacturing stage are presented. It is shown that the foundation of this mode is DCM, the focus of this mode is error transfer process in assembly, the direct analysis basis of this mode is measuring data, the core factor of this mode is dynamic feedback adjustment, and the ultimate goal is to control the consistency of accumulated error between assemblies. In contrast with the working mode based on hard master tooling, under the measuring field and virtual simulation/analysis environment, the function process of this mode is a dynamic closed loop comprising CEs/CRs that can be adjusted continually in real time with CMCA. Lastly, flexible assembling of four wing flap components is verified. Benefit results showed that the propagation of dimension/shape/position for products and flexible tooling can be completed under the working mode based on DCM. Furthermore, assembly accuracy and coordination accuracy can fit design requirements well, and the assembly efficiency with this new working mode is increased about 40%. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background and Purpose: The aim of this paper is to present the influence of Industry 4.0 on the development of the new simulation modelling paradigm, embodied by the Digital Twin concept, and examine the adoption of the new paradigm via a multiple case study involving real-life R&D cases involving academia and industry. Design: We introduce the Industry 4.0 paradigm, presents its background, current state of development and its influence on the development of the simulation modelling paradigm. Further, we present the multiple case study methodology and examine several research and development projects involving automated industrial process modelling, presented in recent scientific publications and conclude with lessons learned. Results: We present the research problems and main results from five individual cases of adoption of the new simulation modelling paradigm. Main lesson learned is that while the new simulation modelling paradigm is being adopted by big companies and SMEs, there are significant differences depending on company size in problems that they face, and the methodologies and technologies they use to overcome the issues. Conclusion: While the examined cases indicate the acceptance of the new simulation modelling paradigm in the industrial and scientific communities, its adoption in academic environment requires close cooperation with industry partners and diversification of knowledge of researchers in order to build integrated, multi-level models of cyber-physical systems. As shown by the presented cases, lack of tools is not a problem, as the current generation of general purpose simulation modelling tools offers adequate integration options. © 2017 Blaž Rodič, published by De Gruyter Open.
