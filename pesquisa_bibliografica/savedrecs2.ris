AB  - In the context of system architecture design, design changes are deemed as an important issue in the field of cyber-physical systems. This is due to their costs that can increase up to several folds with each step of the life cycle, from conceptual design to operation. Accordingly, before putting such changes into practice, their impacts need to be analyzed based on traceability of dependencies among elements in system artifacts. However, traceability-based Change Impact Analysis (CIA) is time consuming and error-prone process, if performed manually. Thus, a number of tools have been developed in this regard. Yet, in the absence of approaches guiding the specification and implementation of such tools, research reveals their inadequacy for the needs of the industry. To overcome this, this paper proposes a domain-specific modeling approach for the conceptualization of traceability-based CIA tools. Such approach is composed of three building blocks. First, a language for traceability-based CIA designed around the concept of "CIA parameters" (i.e., all kind of information that could contribute to quantitative or qualitative change impact assessment). Second, a modeling procedure referring to a multi-view modeling approach that explains how to use the traceability language to allow creation and machine processing of models (i.e., analysis of models in terms of change impact). Third, mechanisms and algorithms focusing on the implementation of the modeling procedure on a metamodeling platform. The proposed approach is thus an attempt to bridge the gap between design and implementation of traceability-based CIA tools. The approach is illustrated on an example from the aviation field.

TI  - Barriers to blockchain-based decentralised energy trading: a systematic review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The increasing adoption of clean energy technologies, including solar and wind generation, demand response, energy efficiency, and energy storage (e.g. batteries and electric vehicles) have led to the evolution of the traditional electricity markets from centralised energy trading systems into Distributed Energy Trading (DET) systems. Consequently, savvy business executives are exploring how blockchain might impact their competitive advantage in the emerging DET markets. Due to its salient features of distributed ledger, consensus mechanisms, cryptography, and smart contracts, blockchain technology is being used to provide decentralised trust, immutability, security and privacy, and transparency in DET system. However, integrating blockchain in DET systems is facing technical, administrative, standardisation and economic barriers. Consequently, we seek to conduct a comprehensive market analysis to identify the specific challenges hindering the integration of blockchain in DET systems. Nonetheless, we noticed that there isn't any evaluation and review framework for conducting a systematic literature review on blockchain-based DET systems. Therefore, in this work we first proposed a conceptual evaluation and review framework for conducting a systematic literature review on blockchain-based DET systems. Then, using the proposed framework, we reviewed the current studies on blockchain-based DET systems to the identify specific challenges hindering the adoption of blockchain and their proposed solutions. Our review found that, although there has been tremendous progress in addressing the technical barriers, the administrative, standardisation and economic barriers have grossly been under reviewed.

AB  - The emergence of new Information and Communication Technologies, such as the Internet of Things and big data and data analytics provides opportunities as well as challenges for the domain of interest, and this paper discusses their importance in condition monitoring and maintenance. In addition, the Open system architecture for condition-based maintenance (OSA-CBM), and the Predictive Health Monitoring methods are gone through. Thereafter, the paper uses bearing fault data from a simulation model with the aim to produce vibration signals where different parameters of the model can be controlled. In connection to the former mentioned a prototype was developed and tested for purposes of simulated rolling element bearing fault systems signals with appropriate fault diagnostic and analytics. The prototype was developed taking into consideration recommended standards (e.g., the OSA-CBM). In addition, the authors discuss the possibilities to incorporate the developed prototype into the Arrowhead framework, which would bring possibilities to: analyze various equipment geographically dispersed, especially in this case its rolling element bearing; support servitization of Predictive Health Monitoring methods and large-scale interoperability; and, to facilitate the appearance of novel actors in the area and thus competition.

TI  - Ontology Learning for Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extant systems engineering standards are so fragmented that the conceptualization of a cohesive body of knowledge is not easy. The discrepancies between different standards lead to misunderstanding and misinterpretation, making communication between stakeholders increasingly difficult. Moreover, these standards remain document centric, whereas systems engineering is transforming from paper-based to a model-based discipline. This requires the use of advanced information exchange schema and digital artifacts to enhance interoperability. Ontologies have been advocated as a mechanism to address these problems, as they can support the model-based transition and formalize the domain knowledge. However, manually creating ontologies is a time-consuming, error-prone, and tedious process. Little has been known about how to automate the development and little work has been conducted for building systems engineering ontologies. Therefore, in this article, we propose an ontology learning methodology to extract a systems engineering ontology from the extant standards. This methodology employs natural language processing techniques to carry out the lexical and morphological analyses on the standard documents. From the learning process, important terminologies, synonyms, concepts, and relations constructing the systems engineering body of knowledge are automatically recognized and classified. A formal and sophisticated system engineering ontology is achieved, which can be used to harmonize the extant standards, unify the languages, and improve the interoperability of the model-based systems engineering approach.

TI  - A Risk Assessment Framework for Cyber-Physical Security in Distribution Grids with Grid-Edge DERs
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Integration of inverter-based distributed energy resources (DERs) is reshaping the landscape of distribution grids to fulfill the socioeconomic, environmental, and sustainability goals. Addressing the technological challenges of DER grid integration requires an adaptive communication layer for efficient DER management and control. This transition has given rise to a cyberphysical system (CPS) architecture within the distribution system, causing new vulnerabilities for cyberphysical attacks. To better address potential threats, this paper presents a comprehensive risk assessment framework for cyberphysical security in distribution grids with grid-edge DERs. The framework incorporates a detailed CPS model accounting for dynamic DER characteristics within the distribution grid. It identifies vulnerabilities in DER communication systems, models attack scenarios, and addresses communication latency crucial for inverter control timescales. Subsequently, the quantification of attack impacts employs an attack probability model including both the vulnerability and criticality of cyber components. The proposed risk assessment framework was validated through testing on the modified IEEE 13-node and 123-node test feeders.

TI  - High-Confidence Medical Device Software Development
T2  - FOUNDATIONS AND TRENDS IN ELECTRONIC DESIGN AUTOMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The design of bug-free and safe medical device software is challenging, especially in complex implantable devices. This is due to the device's closed-loop interaction with the patient's organs, which are stochastic physical environments. The life-critical nature and the lack of existing industry standards to enforce software validation make this an ideal domain for exploring design automation challenges for integrated functional and formal modeling with closed-loop analysis. The primary goal of high-confidence medical device software is to guarantee the device will never drive the patient into an unsafe condition even though we do not have complete understanding of the physiological plant.There are two major differences between modeling physiology and modeling man-made systems: first, physiology is much more complex and less well-understood than man-made systems like cars and airplanes, and spans several scales from the molecular to the entire human body. Secondly, the variability between humans is orders of magnitude larger than that between two cars coming off the assembly line.Using the implantable cardiac pacemaker as an example of closed-loop device, and the heart as the organ to be modeled, we present several of the challenges and early results in model-based device validation. We begin with detailed timed automata model of the pacemaker, based on the specifications and algorithm descriptions from Boston Scientific. For closed-loop evaluation, a real-time Virtual Heart Model (VHM) has been developed to model the electrophysiological operation of the functioning and malfunctioning (i.e., during arrhythmia) hearts. By extracting the timing properties of the heart and pacemaker device, we present a methodology to construct tim-edautomata models for formal model checking and functional testing of the closed-loop system. The VHM's capability of generating clinically-relevant response has been validated for a variety of common arrhythmias. Based on a set of requirements, we describe a framework of Abstraction Trees that allows for interactive and physiologically relevant closed-loop model checking and testing for basic pacemaker device operations such as maintaining the heart rate, atrial-ventricle synchrony and complex conditions such as avoiding pacemaker-mediated tachycardia.Through automatic model translation of abstract models to simulation-based testing and code generation for platform-level testing, this model-based design approach ensures the closed-loop safety properties are retained through the design toolchain and facilitates the development of verified software from verified models. This system is a step toward a validation and testing approach for medical cyber-physical systems with the patient-in-the-loop.

AB  - The paper introduces and studies an idea of distributed modeling treating it as a new paradigm of fuzzy system modeling and analysis, This form of modeling is oriented towards developing individual (local) fuzzy models for specific modeling landmarks (expressed as fuzzy sets) and determining the essential logical relationships between these local models, The models themselves are implemented in the form of logic processors being regarded as specialized fuzzy neural networks, The interaction between the processors is developed either in an inhibitory or excitatory way. In more descriptive way, the distributed model can be sought as a collection of fuzzy finite state machines with their individual local first or higher order memories, It is also clarified how the concept of distributed modeling narrows down a gap between purely numerical (quantitative) models and the qualitative ones originated within the realm of Artificial Intelligence, The overall architecture of distributed modeling is discussed along with the detailed learning schemes, The results of extensive simulation experiments are provided as well.

TI  - Alternative causality assignment procedures in bond graph for mechanical systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes to extend the set of causality assignment procedures. The proposed alternative procedures are mainly inspired by formulations developed in the mechanical domain. They enable Lagrange equations, Hamilton equations, and Boltzmann-Hamel equations to be obtained, as well as formulations with the Lagrange multipliers. In the context of system modeling a varied set of mechanical oriented equations are available in a systematic way from the bond graph representation and the proposed corresponding procedures provide an algorithmic frame for programming these mathematical formulations. The graphical features of the bond graph tool and the causality stroke concept enable formulations to be methodically obtained, formulations that can otherwise be very awkward to express. Also these procedures emphasize certain interesting properties of the bond graph tool e.g.: there is a clear distinction between the energy topology of a system and its dynamic equations; it also enables graphic structural analyses to be undertaken; and finally it can play a pedagogical role in engineering education.

TI  - Nonlinear system modeling by competitive learning and adaptive fuzzy inference system
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART C-APPLICATIONS AND REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling nonlinear systems by neural networks and fuzzy systems encounters some problems, such as the conflict between overfitting and good generalization and low reliability, which requires a great number of fuzzy rules or neural nodes and uses very complicated learning algorithms. In this paper, a new adaptive fuzzy inference system, combined with a learning algorithm, is proposed to cope with these problems. First, the algorithm partitions the input space into some local regions by competitive learning, then it determines the decision boundaries for local input regions, and finally, based on the decision boundaries, it learns the fuzzy rule for each local region by recursive least square (RLS), In the learning algorithm, the key role of the decision boundaries is highly emphasized. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed learning approach and the new adaptive fuzzy inference system, four examples are studied by the proposed method and compared with the previous results.

AB  - The design, development, and use of complex systems models raises a unique class of challenges and potential pitfalls, many of which are commonly recurring problems. Over time, researchers gain experience in this form of modeling, choosing algorithms, techniques, and frameworks that improve the quality, confidence level, and speed of development of their models. This increasing collective experience of complex systems modellers is a resource that should be captured. Fields such as software engineering and architecture have benefited from the development of generic solutions to recurring problems, called patterns. Using pattern development techniques from these fields, insights from communities such as learning and information processing, data mining, bioinformatics, and agent-based modeling can be identified and captured. Collections of such 'pattern languages' would allow knowledge gained through experience to be readily accessible to less-experienced practitioners and to other domains. This paper proposes a methodology for capturing the wisdom of computational modelers by introducing example visualization patterns, and a pattern classification system for analyzing the relationship between micro and macro behaviour in complex systems models. We anticipate that a new field of complex systems patterns will provide an invaluable resource for both practicing and future generations of modelers.

CL  - Baltimore, MD
AB  - Tracking and state estimation technologies are used in a variety of domains that include astronomy, air surveillance, maritime situational awareness, biology, and the internet. Algorithms for tracking and state estimation are becoming increasingly complex and it is difficult for researchers and skilled practitioners to implement and systematically evaluate these state-of-the-art algorithms. System designers also need to objectively assess the performance of algorithms against operational requirements, and tools to conveniently perform such systematic assessment have been lacking. Recognising this problem, an initiative was taken to create an open-source framework called \Stone Soup", which would be used for the development, demonstration, and evaluation of tracking and state estimation algorithms. Stone Soup was made openly available in April 2019 as a beta version (V0.1b1). This paper introduces the Stone Soup framework and describes how users can take advantage of this framework to develop their own algorithms, set up experiments with real-world data, and evaluate algorithms.

TI  - Evaluation of input variables in adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system modeling for an anaerobic wastewater treatment plant under unsteady state
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A conceptual neural-fuzzy model based on adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was proposed to estimate effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD) of a full-scale anaerobic wastewater treatment plant for a sugar factory operating at unsteady state. The fitness of simulated results was improved by adding two new input variables into the model; phase vectors of operational period and effluent COD values of last five days (history). In modeling studies, individual contribution of each input variable to the resulting model was evaluated. The addition of phase vectors and history of five days into the input variable matrix in ANFIS modeling for anaerobic wastewater treatment was applied for the first time in literature to increase the prediction power of the model. By this way, the correlation coefficient between estimated and measured values of output variable (COD) could be increased to the value of 0.8940, which is considered a good fit.

AB  - Deep learning is a promising class of techniques for controlling an autonomous vehicle. However, functional safety validation is seen as a critical issue for these systems due to the lack of transparency in deep neural networks and the safety-critical nature of autonomous vehicles. The black box nature of deep neural networks limits the effectiveness of traditional verification and validation methods. In this paper, we propose two software safety cages, which aim to limit the control action of the neural network to a safe operational envelope. The safety cages impose limits on the control action during critical scenarios, which if breached, change the control action to a more conservative value. This has the benefit that the behaviour of the safety cages is interpretable, and therefore traditional functional safety validation techniques can be applied. The work here presents a deep neural network trained for longitudinal vehicle control, with safety cages designed to prevent forward collisions. Simulated testing in critical scenarios shows the effectiveness of the safety cages in preventing forward collisions whilst under normal highway driving unnecessary interruptions are eliminated, and the deep learning control policy is able to perform unhindered. Interventions by the safety cages are also used to re-train the network, resulting in a more robust control policy.

TI  - Using Regression Learners to Predict Performance Problems on Software Updates: a Case Study on Elevators Dispatching Algorithms
T2  - 36TH ANNUAL ACM SYMPOSIUM ON APPLIED COMPUTING, SAC 2021
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 36th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Remote software deployment and updating has long been commonplace in many different fields, but now, the increasing expansion of IoT and CPSoS (Cyber-Physcal System of Systems) has highlighted the need for additional mechanisms in these systems, to ensure the correct behaviour of the deployed software version after deployment. In this sense, this paper investigates the use of Machine Learning algorithms to predict acceptable behaviour in system performance of a new software release. By monitoring the real performance, eventual unexpected problems can be identified. Based on previous knowledge and actual run-time information, the proposed approach predicts the response time that can be considered acceptable for the new software release, and this information is used to identify problematic releases. The mechanism has been applied to the post-deployment monitoring of traffic algorithms in elevator systems. To evaluate the approach, we have used performance mutation testing, obtaining good results. This paper makes two contributions. First, it proposes several regression learners that have been trained with different types of traffic profiles to efficiently predict response time of the traffic dispatching algorithm. This prediction is then compared with the actual response time of the new algorithm release, and provides a verdict about its performance. Secondly, a comparison of the different learners is performed.

TI  - Agent-Oriented Software Engineering Methodologies: Analysis and Future Directions
T2  - COMPLEXITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) facilitates in building cyber-physical systems, which are significant for Industry 4.0. Agent-based computing represents effective modeling, programming, and simulation paradigm to develop IoT systems. Agent concepts, techniques, methods, and tools are being used in evolving IoT systems. Over the last years, in particular, there has been an increasing number of agent approaches proposed along with an ever-growing interest in their various implementations. Yet a comprehensive and full-fledged agent approach for developing related projects is still lacking despite the presence of agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) methodologies. One of the moves towards compensating for this issue is to compile various available methodologies, ones that are comparable to the evolution of the unified modeling language (UML) in the domain of object-oriented analysis and design. These have become de facto standards in software development. In line with this objective, the present research attempts to comprehend the relationship among seven main AOSE methodologies. More specifically, we intend to assess and compare these seven approaches by conducting a feature analysis through examining the advantages and limitations of each competing process, structural analysis, and a case study evaluation method. This effort is made to address the significant characteristics of AOSE approaches. The main objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of selected AOSE methodologies and provide a proposal of a draft unified approach that drives strengths (best) of these methodologies towards advancement in this area.

TI  - Development of a simulation-software for a hydrogen production process on a solar tower
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A simulation and control model for a two-step thermo-chemical water splitting cycle using metal oxids for the generation of hydrogen with a solar tower system as heat source has been developed. The simulation and control model consists of three main parts, the simulation of the solar flux distribution on the receiver, of the temperatures in the driven reactor modules and the produced hydrogen in the metal oxide.The results of the three parts of the simulation model have been evaluated by comparing and validating them with experimental data from the Hydrosol 100 kW(th) pilot plant at the Plataforma Solar de Almeria (PSA) in Spain.With the overall model of the hydrogen production plant that was created, an evaluation of the two-step thermochemical cycle process in combination with a solar tower system was performed. The model was used to perform parametric studies for the development of the plant and the operation strategies. For this purpose, a provision in the overall model was integrated. The simulation helps to reduce the frequency of using the flux measurement system and can be used for the heliostat field control, in particular for the temperature control in the solar chemical reactor modules. Because of these promising results the overall system model is being extended to enable a use as a control model with controller for the temperature control of the two core reactions in the process.The central control variable of the process control was the operating temperatures for the hydrogen production and the regeneration of the two modules. The process control with its PI controller turned out suitable to compensate diurnal changes of solar input power as well as certain statistical fluctuation due to cloud passage. At the same time the limits of the operability and controllability of the process became clear in terms of the minimum of solar power needed and maximum acceptable gradients.With this experience an operating strategy, the basic parameters of the system in operation, especially the starting up and shutdown procedures, regular operation and the response to disturbances were selected and optimized. With this operation/control strategy such a complex system can be operated in the future on a commercial scale automatically. The obtained results can also be adapted for other solar chemical processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Thriving in the era of hybrid work: Raising cybersecurity awareness using serious games in industry trainings☆
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The important missions of modern software engineering education are to prepare software engineers to work in a hybrid mode and to address the need to enable them to write secure code and deliver secure products and services to the customer. Providing training akin to an authentic experience poses several challenges, such as hybrid infrastructures, lack of engagement, and interactions. Cybersecurity and cybersecurity awareness have also gained importance due to the shift towards work-from-home (WFH) or work-from-anywhere (WFA): The work environment is forced to be distributed across large heterogeneous networks with different security levels. We perceive hybrid work as a work mode where the team members follow WFH or WFA and work from the office. Therefore various security levels at the workplace and restrictions on informal team communications need to be taken into account. We report on experiences from an industrial company producing software and cyber-physical systems. Initially set to update the existing secure code guidelines, the study lead to the discovery that it is crucial to go beyond an up-to-date set of security guidelines: it is mandatory to raise the cybersecurity awareness of those who are to follow the guidelines. We present a novel approach, via serious games, to train software engineers working in the industry, which is delivered in a hybrid mode and equips practitioners to face the challenges of hybrid work. Serious games have more than just entertainment purposes. They have proven effective ways to maintain engagement and boost training, particularly in cybersecurity. We developed and used two innovative serious games to raise cybersecurity awareness: (1) CyberSecurity Challenges (CSC), about how to develop secure software; and (2) Cloud of Assets and Threats (CATS), about cloud security, including its shared responsibility model. It is decisive for the industry that the software is written, developed, and deployed securely. The cloud service has replaced many on-premises deployments. It is essential to enable hybrid work, turning knowledge and practice about cloud security into essential capacities for professional hybrid work. We provide the theoretical foundations for the two serious games and the overall approach. We also report and analyze more than 300 industry practitioners' training experiences from 2017 to 2023 and use this to evaluate the games. By applying serious games in the industry, among practitioners, we gain valuable experience in combining the advantage of different training modes and mitigating the disadvantage of online training. We observe the impact of serious games through a scientifically-sound approach based on the data and feedback we collected systematically from the trainers', trainees', and organization's perspectives. We show through empirical evidence that serious games are a successful approach for training conducted in hybrid work mode while providing authentic and immersed experiences that empower and raise cybersecurity awareness of current and future software professionals.

TI  - IoT sensing framework with inter-cloud computing capability in vehicular networking
T2  - ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to improve convenience, efficiency, and safety in vehicular networking applications (VNA), we propose a novel business model based on platform production services (PPS), design an inter-cloud architecture, and then apply this emerging scheme to vehicle maintenance services (VMS). Both internet of things (IoT) sensing framework and inter-cloud computing architecture are the crucial factors in implementing PPS business model. In the proposed scheme, implementation concept, system architecture, and scalable applications are introduced. Then we design IoT sensing framework for VNA, including cloud services and computation level scalability, inter-cloud architecture supporting telematics applications, and telematics application scenarios. After dissecting mobile cloud computing forming mechanism, we carry out the semantic modeling analysis for inter-cloud service model, and then design a VMS event processing flow to allow the management and cooperation among diverse components by means of event manager. The performance evaluation exemplified by VMS is implemented by means of probabilistic methods. The results show that convenience and efficiency increase in VNA as compared to existing schemes.

TI  - Labeling Self-Tracked Menstrual Health Records With Hidden Semi-Markov Models
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, millions of women track their menstrual cycle and fertility via smartphone-based health apps, generating multivariate time series with frequent missing data. To leverage this type of data for studies of fertility or studies of the effect of the menstrual cycle on symptoms and diseases, it is critical to have methods for identifying reproductive events, such as ovulation, pregnancy losses or births. Here, we present a hierarchical approach relying on hidden semi-Markov models that adapts to changes in tracking behavior, explicitly captures variable- and state- dependent missingness, allows for variables of different type, and quantifies uncertainty. The accuracy on simulated data reaches 98% with no missing data and 90% with realistic missingness. On our partially labeled real-world time series, the accuracy reaches 93%. Our method also accurately predicts cycle length by learning user characteristics. Its implementation is publicly available (HiddenSemiMarkov R package) and transferable to any health time series, including self-reported symptoms and occasional tests.

TI  - The Method and Software Tool for Identification of the Machine Code Architecture in Cyberphysical Devices
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSOR AND ACTUATOR NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work solves the problem of identification of the machine code architecture in cyberphysical devices. A basic systematization of the Executable and Linkable Format and Portable Executable formats of programs, as well as the analysis mechanisms used and the goals achieved, is made. An ontological model of the subject area is constructed, introducing the basic concepts and their relationships. The specificity of the machine code is analyzed, and an analytical record of the process of identifying the architecture of the machine code (MC) processor is obtained. A method for identifying the MC architecture has been synthesized, which includes three successive phases: unpacking the OS image (for a set of identified architectures); building signatures of architectures (their "digital portraits" from the position of MC instructions); identification of the MC architecture for the program under test (using the collected architecture signatures), implemented using four operating modes. A software tool for identifying the MC architecture has been developed in the form of a separate utility that implements the algorithms of the method. The principle of operation of the utility is presented in the form of functional and informational diagrams. Basic testing of the identification utility has been conducted. As a result, a probabilistic assessment of the utility's work was obtained by assigning various programs to the Top-16 selected architectures.

TI  - Event and Learning-Based Resilient Formation Control for Multiagent Systems Under DoS Attacks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a novel event and learning-based resilient formation control strategy for heterogeneous multiagent systems subjected to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and uncertainties. It involves a decoupled cyber-layer and physical system layer design that enables a distributed and model-free approach. In the cyber-layer, the design is an event-triggered resilient observer for a reference exosystem estimation under DoS attacks using dual adaptive laws and an optimal algorithm. This approach eliminates the need for global information of the communication topology and enhances system resilience under attacks. In the physical system layer, the design is a model-free formation output controller for heterogeneous agents based on off-policy reinforcement learning. The incorporation of a new rank condition improves the convergence performance. Experiments using unmanned ground vehicles are conducted for scanning a physical area to verify the effectiveness and resilience of the proposed control strategy.

AB  - In traditional direct torque control system, the torque and flux are directly controlled by means of optimum voltage vectors, where the stator resistance variation deteriorates the dynamic performance. It is necessary to improve estimation accuracy for stator flux and torque. Considering the effects of the stator resistance variation on direct torque control, a novel approach of stator resistance identification based on wavelet network is presented for dynamic performance in low speed status, optimizing the inverter control strategy. The wavelet transform decomposes the signal using dilated and translated wavelets in time-frequency domain into a series of correlation factors or wavelet coefficients. The wavelet network combines the mathematical feature of wavelet transform with learning scheme of conventional neural network into an organic unit, which has been applied to nonlinear function approximation and dynamical system modeling. The improved training algorithm is utilized to fulfill the network parameter initialization, increasing the network stabilization and convergence property. Therefore, the stator voltage vector can be obtained from the stator resistance identification result of wavelet network output, reducing the number of voltage sensors. The simulation results show that the steady state and dynamic performance was improved.

T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Software reliability plays an important role in assuring the quality of a software. To ensure software reliability, the software is tested thoroughly during the testing phase. The time invested in the testing phase or the optimal software release time depends on the level of reliability to be achieved. There axe two different concepts related to software reliability, viz., testing reliability and operational reliability. In this paper, we compare both types of software reliabilities to determine the optimal testing time of the software so as to minimize the total expected software maintenance cost. We consider a software has a number of clusters of modules, each having a different number of errors and a different failure rate. A hyperexponential model is employed for analyzing software reliability growth. Parameter estimation using the maximum likelihood estimation technique is also discussed. Numerical illustrations are taken to explore the effect of various parameters on reliability and maintenance cost. It is noticed that the operational reliability concept should be adopted for the software testing time problem.

M3  - Article
AB  - We present the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of ASTRO, a modular end-to-end system for distributed sensing missions with autonomous networked drones. We introduce the fundamental system architecture features that enable agnostic sensing missions on top of the ASTRO drones. We demonstrate the key principles of ASTRO by using on-board software-defined radios to find and track a mobile radio target. We show how simple distributed on-board machine learning methods can be used to find and track a mobile target, even if all drones lose contact with a ground control. Also, we show that ASTRO is able to find the target even if it is hiding under a three-ton concrete slab, representing a highly irregular propagation environment. Our findings reveal that, despite no prior training and noisy sensory measurements, ASTRO drones are able to learn the propagation environment in the scale of seconds and localize a target with a mean accuracy of 8 m. Moreover, ASTRO drones are able to track the target with relatively constant error over time, even as it moves at a speed close to the maximum drone speed.

A low-level self-manageable architecture model is proposed that includes a new design pattern for implementing agent-embedded IEC 61499 function blocks and agent-based services for self-management. The proposed architecture is validated through the development and evaluation of an agent-based model of an automated conveyor system. The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed architecture to respond to frequent changes typical of modern industrial environments, enabling the system to autonomously discover alternative solutions and flexibly coordinate reconfigurable modules.

AB  - This paper presents a new method for process transfer function identification (TFI) and a new approach for the development of a power unit's dynamic model based on new applications for presented TFI method, This method uses a two-stage procedure which indirectly reduces both noise effects and the order of the transfer function. The first stage is the frequency response identification of a process, while the second one is the transfer function computation using frequency response obtained in the first stage, The power unit dynamic model which is identified using three relatively simple experiments is applied to load-frequency control. This dynamic model developed for the vicinity of the steady-state operation mode can be used for Automatic Generation Control purposes, to tune load-frequency control systems, as well as to build and set up a real-time simulator for dispatcher training, The modeling of 140 MW power units of the IEC (Israel) is fulfilled through implementation of this model and by its identification method yielding sufficiently good results.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Software Engineering and Training
CL  - Madrid, SPAIN
AB  - This paper argues that the concept of modelling, and particularly the modelling of software system structures, is not being given sufficient attention within current sources that describe aspects of the software engineering curriculum. The paper describes the scope of modelling as a general concept, and explains the role that the modelling of software system structures plays within it. It discusses the treatment of this role within the various sources, and compares this both with the experience of the role that such modelling plays in the undergraduate curriculum at Sheffield University, and with the practice in other branches of engineering. The idea is examined that modelling should be treated as a recurring concept within the curriculum, and it is shown that this gives rise to a matrix structure for the software engineering curriculum. The paper discusses how such a structure can be mapped into a conventional hierarchical curriculum model, and the relationships that need to be made explicit in doing so. It describes the practical implications of these results for the structures of degree programmes in software engineering. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A hybrid learning scheme combining EM and MASMOD algorithms for fuzzy local linearization modeling
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fuzzy local linearization (FLL) is a useful divide-and-conquer method for coping with complex problems such as modeling unknown nonlinear systems from data for state estimation and control. Based on a probabilistic interpretation of FLL, this paper proposes a hybrid learning scheme for FLL modeling, which uses a modified adaptive spline modeling (MASMOD) algorithm to construct the antecedent parts (membership functions) in the FLL model, and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to parameterize the consequent parts (local linear models). The hybrid method not only has an approximation ability as good as most neuro-fuzzy network models, but also produces a parsimonious network structure (gain from MASMOD) and provides covariance information about the model error (gain from EM) which is valuable in applications such as state estimation and control. Numerical examples on nonlinear time-series analysis and nonlinear trajectory estimation using FLL models are presented to validate the derived algorithm.

TI  - Linearization and state estimation of unknown discrete-time nonlinear dynamic systems using recurrent neurofuzzy networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Model-based methods for the state estimation and control of linear systems have been well developed and widely applied, In practice, the underlying systems are often unknown and nonlinear, Therefore, data based model identification and associated linearization techniques are very important. Local linearization and feedback linearization have drawn considerable attention in recent years. Ln this paper, linearization techniques using neural networks are reviewed, together with theoretical difficulties associated with the application of feedback linearization, A recurrent neurofuzzy network with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition structure and its learning algorithm are proposed for linearizing unknown discrete-time nonlinear dynamic systems. It can he viewed as a method for approximate feedback linearization, as such it enlarges the class of nonlinear systems that can be feedback linearized using neural networks. Applications of this new method to state estimation are investigated with realistic simulation examples, which shows that the new method has useful practical properties such as model parametric parsimony and learning convergence, and is effective in dealing with complex unknown nonlinear systems.

TI  - Agriculture Model Comparison Framework and MyGeoHub Hosting: Case of Soil Nitrogen
T2  - INVENTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - To be able to compare many agricultural models, a general framework for model comparison when field data may limit direct comparison of models is proposed, developed, and also demonstrated. The framework first calibrates the benchmark model against the field data, and next it calibrates the test model against the data generated by the calibrated benchmark model. The framework is validated for the modeling of the soil nutrient nitrogen (N), a critical component in the overall agriculture system modeling effort. The nitrogen dynamics and related carbon (C) dynamics, as captured in advanced agricultural modeling such as RZWQM, are highly complex, involving numerous states (pools) and parameters. Calibrating many parameters requires more time and data to avoid underfitting. The execution time of a complex model is higher as well. A study of tradeoff among modeling complexities vs. speed-up, and the corresponding impact on modeling accuracy, is desirable. This paper surveys soil nitrogen models and lists those by their complexity in terms of the number of parameters, and C-N pools. This paper also examines a lean soil N and C dynamics model and compares it with an advanced model, RZWQM. Since nitrate and ammonia are not directly measured in this study, we first calibrate RZWQM using the available data from an experimental field in Greeley, CO, and next use the daily nitrate and ammonia data generated from RZWQM as ground truth, against which the lean model's N dynamics parameters are calibrated. In both cases, the crop growth was removed to zero out the plant uptake, to compare only the soil N-dynamics. The comparison results showed good accuracy with a coefficient of determination (R2) match of 0.99 and 0.62 for nitrate and ammonia, respectively, while affording significant speed-up in simulation time. The lean model is also hosted in MyGeoHub cyberinfrastructure for universal online access.

TI  - A comparative study of the MAX and SUM machine-learning algorithms using virtual fuzzy sets
T2  - ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Thispaper presents an adaptive fuzzy learning algorithm for non-linear system identification. The algorithm is based on a concept called a ''virtual fuzzy set''. The concept provides a new representation for the consequent part of a fuzzy production rule. A virtual fuzzy set, which consists of two consecutive fuzzy sets with different degrees of membership, is an imaginary fuzzy set located at a location most appropriate far a numerical training data point. The aim of virtual fuzzy set is to increase the system accuracy, at minimum expense in terms of computer resources. The concept is incorporated into a one-pass build-up adaptive algorithm for non-linear system identification. The results show that better performance can be achieved, compared with traditional fuzzy sets. Two variations of the learning algorithm, using the MAX or SUM of rule degrees, are proposed. The performance of these two approaches in identifying processes with different noise levels is evaluated. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

TI  - VERILOG HDL MODELING STYLES FOR FORMAL VERIFICATION
T2  - COMPUTER HARDWARE DESCRIPTION LANGUAGES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hardware can be formally verified by describing both the implementation and the specification using finite automata and checking to see if the language of the specification contains the language of the implementation. This type of formal verification is called language containment [Kur90]. Most language containment tools use languages that are not popular, which increases the learning curve for new users. We propose performing language containment on designs and specifications written in the Verilog HDL. Our hope is that formal verification will be accepted more readily by hardware designers if they can use a familiar language and a modeling style consistent with existing design tools, such as synthesis and simulation.One type of finite automata is called an L-process. We will describe how they can be modeled in Verilog. Because L-processes frequently contain non-deterministic state transitions and outputs, we propose a natural method consistent with the language definition, current simulators, and current synthesis tools for modeling non-determinism in Verilog. In addition, L-processes can be extended to include restrictions on the time an L-process remains in a sequence of states. We propose methods to model timed L-processes in Verilog using existing timing constructs. We formally define the model of L-processes and show how the simulation model of Verilog is consistent with the formal verification model.

TI  - Evolution in the Education of Software Engineers: Online Course on Cyberphysical Systems with Remote Access to Robotic Devices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONLINE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work is to address, from the educational perspective, the trends in the software engineerring discipline, which rely on a significant increase in the use of remotely accessible and remotely controlled embedded devices. The paper presents an approach and experiences with introducing robotic devices accessible online to a course on Cyberphysical Systems in an undergraduate Software Engineering program. A closer look at both technologies, online labs and cyberphysical systems education, reveals that they are not in sync. Remote labs have embraced a wide variety of science and engineering disciplines, but they are not popular in software engineering. On the other hand, software engineering education, being crucial to the development of cyberphysical systems has not focused on such systems by any measure. This project and paper aim at addressing this gap.

AB  - Todays' product development process is characterized by an increasing use of embedded software solutions integrated into mechatronic products. The development is more and more translocated into a virtual environment. New software methods and tools have to be developed. Industry 4.0 is an approach to highlight the tendency of modem development. Communication between smart products, communication via internet technologies, cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things are the basis of Industry 4.0. Owing this development, used project management methodologies have to be adjusted. In special the well-known V-Model is now extended to the W-Model to cope with the new requirements like communications between different disciplines. New approaches in virtual development have to be adapted to modern teaching techniques. Therefore a course for first semester mechanical engineering students is conducted by the department of Computer Integrated Design at the Technische Universitat Darmstadt. Industry 4.0 fundamentals are taught as well as the development process underlying the so called W-Model. The students will apply this knowledge while they participate in exercises. A web-based tutorial is provided every week with different learning packages. With these learning packages, the students learn to use the project management techniques as well as software development techniques to solve different tasks. Later complex data structures and algorithms can be coded and are applied. The software development techniques, established in development of infointation technologies, gets more important in mechanical engineering. Therefore the students learn these aspects. Over three months length the students work in groups and use all their skills to realize a bigger software-project - a digital factory. They use a virtual testing environment (ViTMeS 3.0) to develop their solution. The presented ViTMeS 3.0 is a further development of a virtual testing environment used in last year's team work. Later they can test their code with a real life example. This example, the digital factory, built with LEGO Mindstorms, is an important part of teaching students the foundations of communication and information techniques as well as software development and programming skills. The last step of the team work is the coding of a graphical user interface for appropriate visualization.

CP  - 17th European Dependable Computing Conference (EDCC)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - In the application of software intensive systems to business-critical processes, tool-supported connection between the perspectives of Software Engineering and Reliability Engineering may largely help conciliation of the contrasting needs of reliability and complexity. In this paper, we present FaultFlow, a newborn tool enabling a Model-Driven Engineering approach for supporting specification, analysis, and simulation of failure logic in component-based systems. The tool exploits a meta-model combining the representation of system configuration hierarchies together with a decoupled representation of its stochastically-timed failure logic. FaultFlow is available in a as-a-service mode through a Web Application deployed on the cloud as well as in a standalone mode, featuring a well-crafted Java API enabling effective specification of the system hierarchy as well as of intra-component fault-to-failure and inter-component failure-to-fault propagation models, respectively starting from SysML Block Definition Diagrams and stochastic Fault Trees representations. The automated transformation towards Stochastic Time Petri Nets enables integration with external reliability tools for quantitative evaluation through numerical solution or simulation. We illustrate FaultFlow key benefits by experimenting the approach on a case study contextualised in an Internet of Things scenario modelling a Pollution Monitor System within a Smart City.

TI  - Model-Free Reinforcement Learning Economic Dispatch Algorithms for Price-Based Residential Demand Response Management System
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is projected that plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) would steadily increase as household appliances. However, PEVs' high power consumption, stochastic usage patterns, and storage capacity will surely result in a rise in the elasticity of demand response and pose significant difficulties for price-based residential demand response management (PRDRM). This artcle aims to optimize a two-tier globally shared nonconvex PRDRM problem with local constraints and PEVs, known as social welfare: maximizing retailer profits and minimizing the combined residential costs. This is done by balancing residential electricity use with retail electricity prices in an unknown market environment. The proposed online/offline model-free reinforcement learning-based economic dispatch (MFRL-ED) methods can adaptively decide on the ideal retail price sequence by integrating the daily residential-retailer behavior model with the agent-environment interaction method, providing a basic MFRL-ED solution for PRDRM without a system identification step and an accurate load-retail model. Experiments show that MFRL-ED methods provide an effective class of PRDRM solutions.

TI  - Automated Identification and Qualitative Characterization of Safety Concerns Reported in UAV Software Platforms
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are nowadays used in a variety of applications. Given the cyber-physical nature of UAVs, software defects in these systems can cause issues with safety-critical implications. An important aspect of the lifecycle of UAV software is to minimize the possibility of harming humans or damaging properties through a continuous process of hazard identification and safety risk management. Specifically, safety-related concerns typically emerge during the operation of UAV systems, reported by end-users and developers in the form of issue reports and pull requests. However, popular UAV systems daily receive tens or hundreds of reports of varying types and quality. To help developers timely identify and triage safety-critical UAV issues, we (i) experiment with automated approaches (previously used for issue classification) for detecting the safety-related matters appearing in the titles and descriptions of issues and pull requests reported in UAV platforms and (ii) propose a categorization of the main hazards and accidents discussed in such issues. Our results (i) show that shallow machine learning (ML)-based approaches can identify safety-related sentences with precision, recall, and F-measure values of about 80%; and (ii) provide a categorization and description of the relationships between safety issue hazards and accidents.

TI  - Numerical and experimental study of the transient behavior of a domestic vapor compression refrigeration system - Influence of refrigerant charge and ambient temperature
T2  - APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, two transient mathematical models are presented for simulating a vapor compression refrigeration system of domestic refrigerator using R134a. One, the thermal model, is based on the application of the first law of thermodynamics and the second, capacitive model, adds the evaluation of the refrigerant mass distribution in the system. An experimental procedure to calculate the thermal conductance and capacity of system components (compressor, condenser, capillary tube, evaporator, cabinet) is presented. Experimental data describing the transient behavior of the refrigeration system are also obtained to validate the simulation procedures. The domestic refrigerator studied is a vertical two compartments refrigerator. The simulation results follow the measured experimental trends and are very satisfactory when compared to the transient and time averaged experimental data. The maximum relative error obtained for simulated temperatures was about 5.65%. Parametric analyses were conducted to identify the influence of refrigerant charge and ambient temperature on the refrigeration system performance. The optimum refrigerant charge has distinct values regarding the operational condition of the system. In the pull-down operation the highest COP is attained for 105 g and 140 g of refrigerant for transient and the steady-state regimes, respectively. In the on-off operation the optimum refrigerant charges are 105 g for transient operation (placing goods inside the compartments) and around 70 g to 95 g for stationary condition (without goods). Excepting for small refrigerant charges similar to 50 g, the higher quantity of refrigerant during the entire system operation is in the evaporator. For low refrigerant charges, 50-70 g, it is also shown a refrigerant migration between condenser and evaporator under the effects of thermal loads when compressor is turned on. Ambient temperature augmentation by 18 degrees C decreases refrigerator COP without thermal load in 10% and 16% for pull-down and on/off operations, respectively. The presented experimental results are new and can be used by other researchers for validating their own simulation models. The developed models can considerably improve the design of domestic refrigeration systems by manufacturers.

TI  - Why to Fail Fast and Often: A Strategy for OT Safety and Security Evaluation
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the Operational Technology (OT) environment becomes increasingly interconnected and integrates diverse technologies, traditional models often struggle to accurately represent the complex interactions and dependencies of the underlying systems. Factors like changes in operational conditions, software updates, and the introduction of new devices can significantly impact the system's risk profile. This paper presents a methodology to bridge the gap between manual and automated safety and security requirements in Industry 4.0 OT environments. First, a meta-model is developed to capture OT infrastructure components and relationships. This is then transformed into a C#-based GUI, enabling tasks like network scanning, application and interface identification, and AI-powered data extraction. Next, compliance checks and risk assessments are conducted using standards such as IEC 62443-3-3 and methods like LOPA, SEFR (HAZID), STRIDE, and DREAD. Finally, the data is converted into system models (e.g., OWL, AutomationML) for visualization. This approach reduces complexity and time by 83.72%, though it faces challenges like platform dependency and resource constraints.

TI  - Vehicular Fog Computing Enabled Real-Time Collision Warning via Trajectory Calibration
T2  - MOBILE NETWORKS & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vehicular fog computing (VFC) has been envisioned as a promising paradigm for enabling a variety of emerging intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, due to inevitable as well as non-negligible issues in wireless communication, including transmission latency and packet loss, it is still challenging in implementing safety-critical applications, such as real-time collision warning in vehicular networks. In this paper, we present a vehicular fog computing architecture, aiming at supporting effective and real-time collision warning by offloading computation and communication overheads to distributed fog nodes. With the system architecture, we further propose a trajectory calibration based collision warning (TCCW) algorithm along with tailored communication protocols. Specifically, an application-layer vehicular-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication delay is fitted by the Stable distribution with real-world field testing data. Then, a packet loss detection mechanism is designed. Finally, TCCW calibrates real-time vehicle trajectories based on received vehicle status including GPS coordinates, velocity, acceleration, heading direction, as well as the estimation of communication delay and the detection of packet loss. For performance evaluation, we build the simulation model and implement conventional solutions including cloud-based warning and fog-based warning without calibration for comparison. Real-vehicle trajectories are extracted as the input, and the simulation results demonstrate that the effectiveness of TCCW in terms of the highest precision and recall in a wide range of scenarios.

TI  - Explainable Anomaly Detection Based on Operational Sequences in Industrial Control Systems
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditionally, industrial control systems (ICS) are closed structures that rely on specialized hardware and software with proprietary control protocols. However, with the advancement of technology and the digitalization of ICS, the attack space available to malicious actors has significantly expanded. Anomaly detection systems, initially implemented for detecting device faults or failures, have increasingly become the focus of research aimed at identifying attack patterns as cyberattack techniques become more sophisticated and intelligent. Many anomaly detection algorithms based on deep learning models have good performance but often involve complex neural network structures, creating a black-box issue where users cannot interpret the decisions made by the models. The black-box issue hinders the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can ensure efficient and secure operation in ICS environments. Various attempts have been made to address the black box issue but limited to identifying the features that caused the anomaly. In detecting target anomalies in industrial control system operational data, it is important not only to identify feature importance, but also to consider correlations between variables, and to provide intuitive explanations to enhance the understanding of operators. To satisfy these major values, this paper proposes a method for explainable anomaly detection for ICS.

AB  - This paper deals with some important questions of the CMAC neural networks. CMAC - which belongs to the family of feed-forward networks and is considered as an alternative to MLPs - has some attractive features. The most important ones are its extremely fast learning capability and the special architecture that lets effective digital hardware implementation possible. Although the CMAC architecture as proposed in the middle of the seventies quite a lot open questions have been left even for today. Among them the most important ones are its modeling and generalization capabilities. While some essential questions of its modeling capability were addressed in the literature no detailed analysis of its generalization properties can be found. Neural networks with good generalization capability play important role in system modeling. This paper shows that CMAC may have significant generalization error, even in one-dimensional case, where the network can learn exactly any training data set. The paper shows that this generalization error is caused mainly by the architecture and the training rule of the network. It presents a mathematical analysis of the generalization error, derives a general expression of this error and proposes a modified training algorithm that helps to reduce this error significantly.

TI  - Systemic mechanism of organizing and assembling information
T2  - KYBERNETES
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - The goal is to find a systemic information assembling mechanism, which would describe not only a human being's way of organizing the accepted information but also the general information regularities of this process, applied to different information objects.Design/methodology/approach - Mathematical formalism of Informational Macrodynamics is employed for system modeling of the object's regularities and the main systemic mechanisms. The developed systemic assembling mechanism joins a chaotic oscillation of incoming information frequencies, initiating a chaotic resonance, into a cooperative attractor. A chain of sequentially built attractors generates a collective information dynamic network (IN), whose hierarchy models the multiple information contributions. An information structure of the IN node's attractors is memorized by the key-lock connections of resonance frequencies.Findings - The results indicate that formalized functions of the assembling cooperative information mechanisms represent a general attribute of a system.Practical implications - A wide area of applications includes behavior analysis, cognition, artificial intelligence, data organization and management, social systems, and education.Originality/value - The considered results bring together the formal systemic model of the regularities of collective macrodynamics and the mathematical evaluation of a complex individual's behavior in a collective environment.

TI  - Extensive Review of Threat Models for DevSecOps
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Amidst the rising tide of cyber threats, the software industry is gravitating toward the widespread adoption of DevSecOps as a crucial defense strategy. In response to the evolving application development needs, DevSecOps enables developers and enterprises to seamlessly integrate security and, fortify digital realms against modern cybersecurity challenges. This study attempts to identify and review various threat models that can be combined with components of DevSecOps, such as its principles, methodology, tools, and workflows. Underscoring the necessity of early security considerations in the software development life cycle, the discussion then delves into the details of adaptable strategies and best practices to mitigate potential threats proactively, while also emphasizing the pivotal role of monitoring and incident response in the prompt detection and mitigation of potential risks. Moreover, this study focuses on identifying the challenges associated with adopting traditional threat models in the contemporary landscape of multi-cloud architecture, a prevalent paradigm in current technological landscapes. Recognizing the intricacies of securing applications across diverse cloud environments, this scholarly work proposes a layered framework for multi-cloud, which can be adopted by practitioners to address the security challenges of the multi-cloud environment. Hence, this investigation furnishes valuable insights into the requirements, workflow and threat models of DevSecOps in single-cloud and emerging multi-cloud environment.

AB  - Fuzzy System Modeling (FSM) is one of the most prominent system modeling tools in analyzing the data in the presence of uncertainty. Linguistic Fuzzy Rulebase (LFR) structure, in which both the antecedent and consequent variables are represented by fuzzy sets, is the most well known fuzzy rulebase structure in the literature. The proposed FSM method identifies LFR system model by executing Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering method. One of the sources of uncertainty in system modeling is the uncertainty in selecting learning parameters. In order to capture this uncertainty in a more realistic way, the antecedent and consequent variables are represented by using Type 2 fuzzy sets that are constructed by executing FCM method with different level of fuzziness, in, values. The proposed system modeling approach is applied on a well-known benchmark data set where the goal is to predict the price of a stock. After comparing the results with the ones obtained with other system modeling tools, it can be claimed successful results are achieved.

CP  - 13th International Conference on the Quality of Information and Communications Technology (QUATIC)
CL  - Univ Algarve, Faro, PORTUGAL
AB  - DevOps is becoming one of the most popular software development methodologies, especially for cloud-based applications. In spite of its popularity, it is still difficult to integrate non-functional requirements, such as security, in the full application development life-cycle. In some recent works, security DevOps (or SecDevOps) has been introduced, in order to enable the adoption of Security-by-Design principles in DevOps processes. In [4], a novel SecDevOps methodology was proposed to exploit such integration, but the security assessment and testing were performed with a static approach. In this paper, we propose to extend the SecDevOps methodology with the adoption of a novel security testing technique in order to dynamically test security properties in the operational phase, too. In order to validate the proposed approach, a cloud application case study involving the WordPress software module is presented and analyzed.

TI  - Towards Automated Generation of Smart Grid Cyber Range for Cybersecurity Experiments and Training
T2  - 2023 53RD ANNUAL IEEE/IFIP INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DEPENDABLE SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS - SUPPLEMENTAL VOLUME, DSN-S
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 53rd Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN)

AB  - Assurance of cybersecurity is crucial to ensure dependability and resilience of smart power grid systems. In order to evaluate the impact of potential cyber attacks, to assess deployability and effectiveness of cybersecurity measures, and to enable hands-on exercise and training of personals, an interactive, virtual environment that emulates the behaviour of a smart grid system, namely smart grid cyber range, has been demanded by industry players as well as academia. A smart grid cyber range is typically implemented as a combination of cyber system emulation, which allows interactivity, and physical system (i.e., power grid) simulation that are tightly coupled for consistent cyber and physical behaviours. However, its design and implementation require intensive expertise and efforts in cyber and physical aspects of smart power systems as well as software/system engineering. While many industry players, including power grid operators, device vendors, research and education sectors are interested, availability of the smart grid cyber range is limited to a small number of research labs. To address this challenge, we have developed a framework for modelling a smart grid cyber range using an XML-based language, called SG-ML, and for "compiling" the model into an operational cyber range with minimal engineering efforts. The modelling language includes standardized schema from IEC 61850 and IEC 61131, which allows industry players to utilize their existing configurations. The SG-ML framework aims at making a smart grid cyber range available to broader user bases to facilitate cybersecurity R&D and hands-on exercises.

AB  - In 2000 the European Robotic Arm (ERA) will be launched and attached to the Russian segment of International Space Station Alpha. The arm will initially be used to support assembly operations on the Russian segment, and will eventually be used as servicing tool for at least ten years during Space Station life cycle. The Mission Preparation and Training Equipment (MPTE) is an important part of the ERA project. ERA operations will be prepared, planned, and supported from the MPTE, and ERA operators will be trained with the MPTE. Three identical versions of the MPTE will be installed at RSC/Energia-MCC and at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Russia, and at ESA/ESTEC in the Netherlands. Each of the facilities has its particular function in support of ERA operations, training, and maintenance.The design of the MPTE is based on existing tools and facilities to a maximum extent. Re-use is made of the real-time operations simulation facility EUROSIM, including the Image Generation Subsystem (IGS), and of the Columbus Ground Software system (CGS). Also, re-use is made of developments from the ERA projects, both hardware and software. Next to elegant breadboard systems of ERA flight hardware, development support simulation models from the ERA Simulations Facility (ESF) are re-used.

TI  - A general modeling and analysis framework for software fault detection and correction process
T2  - SOFTWARE TESTING VERIFICATION & RELIABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Software reliability growth modeling plays an important role in software reliability evaluation. To incorporate more information and provide more accurate analysis, modeling software fault detection and correction processes has attracted widespread research attention recently. In modeling software correction processes, the assumption of fault correction time is relaxed from constant delay to random delay. However, stochastic distribution of fault correction time brings more difficulties in modeling and corresponding parameter estimation. In this paper, a framework of software reliability models containing both information from software fault detection process and correction process is studied. Different from previous extensions on software reliability growth modeling, the proposed approach is based on Markov model other than a nonhomogeneous Poisson process model. Also, parameter estimation is carried out with weighted least-square estimation method, which emphasizes the influence of later data on the prediction. Two data sets from practical software development projects are applied with the proposed framework, which shows satisfactory performance with the results. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Vulnerability and Impact of Machine Learning-Based Inertia Forecasting Under Cost-Oriented Data Integrity Attack
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing penetration of renewables, the power system is facing unprecedented challenges of low-inertia levels. The inherent ability of the system to defense disturbance and power imbalance through inertia response is degraded, and thus, system operators need to make faster and more efficient scheduling operations. As one of the most promising solutions, machine learning (ML) methods have been investigated and employed to realize effective inertia forecasting with considerable accuracy. Nevertheless, it is yet to understand its vulnerability with the growing threat of cyberattacks. To this end, this paper proposes a methodological framework to explore the vulnerability of ML-based inertia forecasting models, with a special focus on data integrity attacks. In particular, a cost-oriented false data injection attack is proposed, for the first time, with the primary objective to significantly increase the system operation cost while retaining the stealthiness of the attack via minimizing the differences between the pre-perturbed and after-perturbed inertia forecasts. Moreover, we propose four vulnerability assessment metrics for the ML-based inertia forecasting models. Case studies on the GB power system demonstrate the vulnerability and impact of the ML-based inertia forecasting models, as well as the stealthiness and transferability of the proposed cost-oriented data integrity attacks.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology (PICMET)
CL  - Honolulu, HI
AB  - Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) is a semi quantitative system modeling technique that is used in technology management to capture, synthesize and analyze expert and stakeholder knowledge for the purpose of technology assessment, product planning, and scenario studies. The resulting FCM models are generated in interviews, focus groups, or workshops and represent complex and dynamic systems as elements (so-called concepts) and cause-and-effect relationships. Researchers often compare FCM to investigate cognitive differences between individuals or groups, identify unique perspectives on a specific topic, or track changes in knowledge (i.e. learning). Using a variety of metrics, comparison studies investigate diverse characteristics of FCMs, such as structure, cognitive complexity, and similarity. To date, no consensus on metrics and their interpretation has emerged. To strengthen the scientific value of FCM as a research tool, this study systematically reviews existing metrics for content, structure, and dynamic behavior and applies them to the comparison of two FCM models. It illustrates how these three types of metrics arc used for comparison and reveals limitations. In particular, content metrics are needed that are generalizable for all possible weights of causal relationships. Also, structural metrics that are suitable for directed and weighted FCMs still need to be developed.

TI  - Nonlinear System Modeling with Random Matrices: Echo State Networks Revisited
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Echo state networks (ESNs) are a novel form of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that provide an efficient and powerful computational model approximating nonlinear dynamical systems. A unique feature of an ESN is that a large number of neurons (the "reservoir") are used, whose synaptic connections are generated randomly, with only the connections from the reservoir to the output modified by learning. Why a large randomly generated fixed RNN gives such excellent performance in approximating nonlinear systems is still not well understood. In this brief, we apply random matrix theory to examine the properties of random reservoirs in ESNs under different topologies (sparse or fully connected) and connection weights (Bernoulli or Gaussian). We quantify the asymptotic gap between the scaling factor bounds for the necessary and sufficient conditions previously proposed for the echo state property. We then show that the state transition mapping is contractive with high probability when only the necessary condition is satisfied, which corroborates and thus analytically explains the observation that in practice one obtains echo states when the spectral radius of the reservoir weight matrix is smaller than 1.

AB  - Autonomously adapting signalling strategies to changing traffic demands in urban areas have been frequently used as application scenario for self-organising systems in general as well as for Autonomic or Organic Computing systems in particular. The Organic Traffic Control (OTC) system is one of the most prominent representatives in this domain. OTC implements a multi-layered Observer/Controller (O/C) architecture and utilises a strongly modified eXtended Classifier System (XCS-O/C) for the task of self-adaptation. In this paper, we extend the algorithmic structure of XCS-O/C by a novel interpolation-based approach that incorporates existing knowledge beyond the traditional means. We demonstrate the benefit of the developed approach in terms of reduced delay times for near-to-reality simulations of realistic traffic conditions from Hamburg, Germany.

TI  - NONLINEAR PARAMETRIC IDENTIFICATION USING PERIODIC EQUILIBRIUM STATES - APPLICATION TO AN AIRCRAFT LANDING GEAR DAMPER
T2  - NONLINEAR DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The subject of this paper is the development and assessment of a new nonlinear parametric identification method for dynamic systems using periodic equilibrium states or outputs.  The method consists of a modified Bayesian point estimation technique which can be used in combination with a time discretization method or a shooting method to obtain the periodic equilibrium states.  It is assumed that the specific excited and measured periodic solution can be computed directly from a static initial guess.  An important feature of this estimator is the possibility to estimate the best parameters based on all experiments of the complete experimental set-up.  The choice of using periodic states appears to be computationally efficient compared to using transient states.  The new method is applied to multiple sets of nonlinear shaker-test measurements of a uniaxially loaded F-16 nose landing gear damper, for which a standard 1 dof mechanical model and a more comprehensive 2 dof thermo-mechanical model are postulated.  Finally, the predictive power of the method is assessed by comparison of predictions for a transient drop-test load case of the 'best' 2 dof model with corresponding parameters and real drop-test measurements.

M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS) is the premier conference in the area of real time systems, presenting innovations in the field with respect to theory and practice. RTSS provides a forum for the presentation of high-quality, original research covering all aspects of real-time systems theory, design, analysis, implementation, evaluation, and experiences. RTSS 2017 will continue making RTSS an expansive and inclusive symposium, looking to embrace new and emerging areas of real-time systems research.This proposal is to organize, in conjunction with the symposium, a Ph.D. student poster forum (i) to discuss the set of interdisciplinary research problems that arise in the context of IoT and CPS, (ii) to determine commonalities and fundamental differences between the IoT and CPS domains, (iii) to identify novel applications that become feasible due to the integration of local vs. hosted computing, local vs. hosted storage, communication, and interaction with the physical world at scale, and (iv) to define an initial system architecture that addresses some of these research problems. The primary goal is to help students (and the real-time community) recognize that IoT and CPS systems are different from each other as well as historically over-engineered real-time embedded systems of the past, and to provide a forum by which students can discuss their proposal for addressing the complicated aggregate systems issues that arise in this context. Forums of this sort have significant educational value for graduate students.  It encourages the students to begin seriously thinking about their personal future research agenda and opens pathways to burgeoning ideas.  There is a plan to reward best submissions as well as encourage students with financial difficulties to participate, both merit-based and need-based stipends will be provided to offset participation costs.  The project includes broadening participation criteria as part of the recruitment strategy.

AB  - According to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)), the US Department of Defense (DoD) recognizes that there is a "persistent lack of a consistent approach ... for the certification of software assurance tools, testing and methodologies" [1]. As a result, the ASD(R&E) is seeking "to address vulnerabilities and weaknesses to cyber threats of the software that operates ... routine applications and critical kinetic systems ..." The mitigation of these risks has been recognized as a significant issue to be addressed in both the public and private sectors. In this paper we examine deficiencies in various software-assurance approaches and suggest ways in which they can be improved.We take a broad look at current approaches, identify their inherent weaknesses and propose approaches that serve to reduce risks. Some technical, economic and governance issues are:Development of software-assurance technical standardsManagement of software-assurance standardsEvaluation of tools, techniques, and metricsDetermination of update frequency for tools, techniquesFocus on most pressing threats to software systemsSuggestions as to risk-reducing research areasEstablishment of models of the economics of software-assurance solutions, and testing and certifying softwareWe show that, in order to improve current software assurance policy and practices, particularly with respect to security, there has to be a major overhaul in how software is developed, especially with respect to the requirements and testing phases of the SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle). We also suggest that the current preventative approaches are inadequate and that greater reliance should be placed upon avoidance and deterrence.We also recommend that those developing and operating security-critical and safety-critical systems exchange best-of-breed software assurance methods to prevent the vulnerability of components leading to compromise of entire systems of systems. The recent catastrophic loss of a Malaysia Airlines airplane is then presented as an example of possible compromises of physical and logical security of on-board communications and management and control systems.

TI  - Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system for modelling and control
T2  - 2002 FIRST INTERNATIONAL IEEE SYMPOSIUM INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS, VOL 1, PROCEEDINGS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st International IEEE Symposium on Intelligent Systems
CL  - VARNA, BULGARIA
AB  - A new approach for an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system for modeling and control is proposed. This approach uses a general regression neural network with a different learning capability from the classical clustering algorithm normally used by this specific network. The antecedent parameters of the regression network are obtained throw an iterative grid partition process instead of the usually gradient descent algorithm or the classical grid partition method in the literature of neural network modeling. The membership functions used in the antecedent part are asymmetric and with varying shapes (triangles, gaussian, trapezoidal, etc) which is less common in the fuzzy modeling literature. The consequent parameters are obtained using the least squares estimates algorithm. In the simulation, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system architecture is used to model a non-linear function and to control the motion of a helicopter in the hover flight mode with promising results.

TI  - SBIR Phase I:  Multi-Material 3D Printing of  Personalized Medical Simulation Models
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - This SBIR Phase I project will develop the necessary technology and manufacturing workflows to provide medical professionals with extremely realistic physical models of tissues and organs. The models will be manufactured rapidly (within a few hours), inexpensively, and on-demand. They will be patient-specific based on the patient?s CT and MRI scan data.  This will have profound implications on the planning of complex medical procedures such as tumor removal and will enable medical professionals and their teams to practice patient-specific surgical scenarios. This will improve surgical outcome, generate efficiencies in the operating room and decrease medical errors which, by some accounts, are the third largest cause of death in the United States. The ability to 3D print realistic human organ models will also provide medical students with a way to practice medical procedures with a wide degree of diversity. This will accelerate the learning rate and expand the breadth of training experiences.  Similarly, the models will provide a way for medical professionals to practice rare, high-risk procedures on-demand. The proposed 3D models will become a central part of the medical simulation toolbox and will enable a new generation of surgical planning and education.The ability to manufacture extremely realistic physical models rapidly, inexpensively, and on-demand relies on a novel multimaterial additive manufacturing process with a closed-feedback loop enabled by machine vision. This new process manufactures objects layer by layer, each layer made from a discrete set of elements, where each element is built from one material from a pallette of materials. The use of the closed-feedback loop system allows incorporating both liquids and solids with a wide range of mechanical and appearance properties. The development of a material palette that is necessary to mimic properties of real tissues will be a crucial part of the project. This material palette will be expanded by spatially combining base materials into composite structures. The second main thrust of the project relies on a software design workflow that translates geometric and material specifications describing a simulation model (e.g., an organ or a tissue) into multimaterial volumetric data. The volumetric data will be used as input to the multimaterial printing platform. The new design workflow requires development of modeling approaches that go beyond traditional, boundary-based CAD representations.

TI  - Wavelet networks for nonlinear system modeling
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a nonlinear systems and function learning by using wavelet network. Wavelet networks. are as neural network for training and structural approach. But, training algorithms of wavelet networks is required a smaller number of iterations when the compared with neural networks. Gaussian-based mother wavelet function is used as an activation function. Wavelet networks have three main parameters; dilation, translation, and connection parameters (weights). Initial values of these parameters are randomly selected. They are optimized during training (learning) phase. Because of random selection of all initial values, it may not be suitable for process modeling. Because wavelet functions are rapidly vanishing functions. For this reason heuristic procedure has been used. In this study serial-parallel identification model has been applied to system modeling. This structure does not utilize feedback. Real system outputs have been exercised for prediction of the future system outputs. So that stability and approximation of the network is guaranteed. Gradient methods have been applied for parameters updating with momentum term. Quadratic cost function is used for error minimization. Three example problems have been examined in the simulation. They are static nonlinear functions and discrete dynamic nonlinear system.

TI  - Assessment of fault-detection processes: An approach based on reliability techniques
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Two major factors influence the number of faults uncovered by a fault-detection process applied to a software artifact (eg, specification, code):ability of the process to uncover faults,quality of the artifact (number of existing faults).These two factors must be assessed separately, so that one can:switch to a different process if the one being used is not effective enough, orstop the process if the number of remaining faults is acceptable.The Fault-Detection Process Assessment model can be applied to all sorts of artifacts produced during software development, and provides measures for both the 'effectiveness of a fault-detection process' and the 'number of existing faults in the artifact'. The model is valid even when there are zero defects in the artifact or the fault-detection process is intrinsically unable to uncover faults. More specifically, the times between fault discoveries are modeled via reliability-based techniques with an exponential distribution. The hazard rate is the product of 'effectiveness of the fault-detection process' and 'number of faults in the artifact'. Based on general hypotheses, the number of faults in an artifact follows a Poisson distribution. The unconditional distribution, whose parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood, is obtained.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 14th International Conference on VLSI Design
CL  - BANGALORE, INDIA
AB  - The topic of reducing power,er dissipation in embedded systems has received considerable attention in the recent years. Techniques have been reported to minimize energy dissipation through (a) selection of better algorithms for the application e.g. DSP algorithms that require fewer number of operations to perform a task such as filtering (b) minimizing state transitions and switching activity in the hardware implementation, and (c) reducing the operating supply voltage by changing the architecture of the system e.g. through the use of pipelining. However power dissipation is often neglected when developing the software for embedded systems. Software optimization techniques can be used to reduce the cost, size, and power dissipation in embedded systems without adding to system overheads. In this paper we view, the power dissipation as consisting of two parts, the power dissipated in the application-specific integrated circuits (hardware power) and the power dissipated by the CPU, memory and associated busses (software power). We provide a trace-based technique to estimate software power and study the effect of different code optimization techniques on software power performance and code size.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE/ACM 19th Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems (SEAMS)
CL  - Lisbon, PORTUGAL
AB  - Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a decentralised machine learning paradigm for distributed systems, particularly in edge and IoT environments. However, ensuring fault tolerance and self-recovery in such scenarios remains challenging, because of the centralised model aggregation which acts as a single point of failure. A possible solution to this challenge would rely on the continuous replication of the global FL state across participating nodes and the functional suitability of any node to replace the aggregator in case of failures. These functional requirements can be implemented using one of the existing distributed consensus algorithm, such as Raft. Our approach utilises Raft's leader election and log replication mechanisms to enable automatic stateful recovery after failures and thus to improve fault tolerance. The log replication process efficiently maintains consistency and coherence across distributed FL nodes, ensuring uninterrupted training process and model convergence. This enhances the robustness of the overall FL system, especially in dynamic and unreliable cyber-physical conditions. To demonstrate the viability of our approach, we present a proof-of-concept implementation based on the existing FL framework Flower. We conduct a series of experiments to measure the aggregator re-election time and traffic overheads associated with the state replication. Despite the expected traffic overheads growing with the number of FL nodes, the results demonstrate a resilient self-recovering system capable of withstanding node failures while maintaining model consistency.

TI  - Using EtherCAT technology to launch online automated guided vehicle manipulation with unity-based platform for smart warehouse management
T2  - IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Industry 4.0, the innovative concept of a smart warehouse is defined as a progressive development in logistics and operations management. Numerous advanced techniques are recommended for integration, including wearable devices, communication, loading/unloading, optimization, robotics, and automated transportation, among others. Currently, the growing demand for swift cargo distribution, cost-effective labour utilization, and enhanced productivity stands as an urgent topic for both enterprises and scholars. This paper presents an EtherCAT-based model of automated guided vehicle (AGV)-manipulation introduced within the Unity platform for smart warehouse management. The working environment selected for this model is a cross-docking warehouse with a chessboard layout. Initially, theoretical computations pertaining to mechanical design are established to provide accurate parameters. Subsequently, the structure of the TwinCAT Human-Machine Interface Server and the configuration within the Unity environment are outlined. Following that, the software architecture, encompassing data exchange and a set of motion commands, is meticulously explained. To validate the proposed approach, several laboratory tests are conducted under identical conditions. This research offers several contributions: firstly, it introduces the innovative use of real-time technology to represent AGV systems; secondly, it elucidates the potential connection between virtual reality and the physical model; and thirdly, it employs fluid motion techniques to illustrate and visualize driving performance. These findings hold significant promise not only for the advancement of smart warehouse management but also for the broader landscape of digital trade.These works present the emerging technologies (motion control, digital twin, autonomous vehicle) into smart mobility platform. Owing to our development, several applications in warehouse management could be reached such as online training, virtual-reality interaction, supervision and monitoring, driven control.image

TI  - Threat Hunting Architecture Using a Machine Learning Approach for Critical Infrastructures Protection
T2  - BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The number and the diversity in nature of daily cyber-attacks have increased in the last few years, and trends show that both will grow exponentially in the near future. Critical Infrastructures (CI) operators are not excluded from these issues; therefore, CIs' Security Departments must have their own group of IT specialists to prevent and respond to cyber-attacks. To introduce more challenges in the existing cyber security landscape, many attacks are unknown until they spawn, even a long time after their initial actions, posing increasing difficulties on their detection and remediation. To be reactive against those cyber-attacks, usually defined as zero-day attacks, organizations must have Threat Hunters at their security departments that must be aware of unusual behaviors and Modus Operandi. Threat Hunters must face vast amounts of data (mainly benign and repetitive, and following predictable patterns) in short periods to detect any anomaly, with the associated cognitive overwhelming. The application of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Machine Learning (ML) techniques, can remarkably impact the real-time analysis of those data. Not only that, but providing the specialists with useful visualizations can significantly increase the Threat Hunters' understanding of the issues that they are facing. Both of these can help to discriminate between harmless data and malicious data, alleviating analysts from the above-mentioned overload and providing means to enhance their Cyber Situational Awareness (CSA). This work aims to design a system architecture that helps Threat Hunters, using a Machine Learning approach and applying state-of-the-art visualization techniques in order to protect Critical Infrastructures based on a distributed, scalable and online configurable framework of interconnected modular components.

TI  - Digital Twin in the IoT Context: A Survey on Technical Features, Scenarios, and Architectural Models
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital twin (DT) is an emerging concept that is gaining attention in various industries. It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the "softwarization" of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process.

TI  - Latent vector autoregressive modeling and feature analysis of high dimensional and noisy data from dynamic systems
T2  - AICHE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, a novel latent vector autoregressive (LaVAR) modeling algorithm with a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) objective is proposed to estimate a fully-interacting reduced-dimensional dynamic model. This algorithm is an advancement of the dynamic inner canonical correlation analysis (DiCCA) algorithm, which builds univariate latent autoregressive models that are noninteracting. The dynamic latent variable scores of the proposed algorithm are guaranteed to be orthogonal with a descending order of predictability, retaining the properties of DiCCA. Further, the LaVAR-CCA algorithm solves multiple latent variables simultaneously with a statistical interpretation of the profile likelihood. The Lorenz oscillator with noisy measurements and an application case study on an industrial dataset are used to illustrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. The reduced-dimensional latent dynamic model has numerous potential applications for prediction, feature analysis, and diagnosis of systems with rich measurements.

TI  - Fault tolerant adaptive parallel and distributed simulation through functional replication
T2  - SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents FT-GAIA, a software-based fault-tolerant parallel and distributed simulation middleware. FT-GAIA has being designed to reliably handle Parallel And Distributed Simulation (PADS) models, which are needed to properly simulate and analyze complex systems arising in any kind of scientific or engineering field. PADS takes advantage of multiple execution units run in multicore processors, cluster of workstations or HPC systems. However, large computing systems, such as HPC systems that include hundreds of thousands of computing nodes, have to handle frequent failures of some components. To cope with this issue, FT-GAIA transparently replicates simulation entities and distributes them on multiple execution nodes. This allows the simulation to tolerate crash-failures of computing nodes. Moreover, FT-GAIA offers some protection against Byzantine failures, since interaction messages among the simulated entities are replicated as well, so that the receiving entity can identify and discard corrupted messages. Results from an analytical model and from an experimental evaluation show that FT-GAIA provides a high degree of fault tolerance, at the cost of a moderate increase in the computational load of the execution units.

TI  - AI-augmented usability evaluation framework for software requirements specification in cyber physical human systems
T2  - INTERNET OF THINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - A number of research in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) have shown that usability is an important goal for cyber-physical human systems for wider acceptance by their end-users. To evaluate the usability of a system under design, usability evaluation methods predominantly rely on subject matter experts or testers' assessments. However, integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and existing usability evaluation methods' processes can aid to evolve more effective user-centred designs. In this paper, we conceptualize an AI-augmented usability evaluation framework (AIUEF) that aims at replacing 'end-users' with 'personas' to evaluate requirements involving human-computer interaction (HCI) for a given Software Requirements Specification (SRS). We present a blueprint of AIUEF establishing a theoretical basis for an automated usability evaluation of HCI requirements for a given SRS with an aim to improve the usability of a system under design.

TI  - Quantitative Performance Evaluation of Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid AADL Designs Using Statistical Model Checking
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The hybrid architecture analysis and design language (AADL) has been proposed to model the interactions between embedded control systems and continuous physical environment. However, the worst-case performance analysis of hybrid AADL designs often leads to overly pessimistic estimations, and is not suitable for accurate reasoning about overall system performance, in particular when the system closely interacts with an uncertain external environment. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a statistical model checking-based framework that can perform quantitative evaluation of uncertainty-aware hybrid AADL designs against various performance queries. Our approach extends hybrid AADL to support the modeling of environment uncertainties. Furthermore, we propose a set of transformation rules that can automatically translate AADL designs together with designers' requirements into networks of priced timed automata and performance queries, respectively. Comprehensive experimental results on the movement authority scenario of Chinese train control system level 3 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TI  - Efficient Model-Driven Prototyping for Edge Analytics
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Software development cycles in the context of Internet of Things (IoT) applications require the orchestration of different technological layers, and involve complex technical challenges. The engineering team needs to become experts in these technologies and time delays are inherent due to the cross-integration process because they face steep learning curves in several technologies, which leads to cost issues, and often to a resulting product that is prone to bugs. We propose a more straightforward approach to the construction of high-quality IoT applications by adopting model-driven technologies (DIME and Pyrus), that may be used jointly or in isolation. The presented use case connects various technologies: the application interacts through the EdgeX middleware platform with several sensors and data analytics pipelines. This web-based control application collects, processes and displays key information about the state of the edge data capture and computing that enables quick strategic decision-making. In the presented case study of a Stable Storage Facility (SSF), we use DIME to design the application for IoT connectivity and the edge aspects, MongoDB for storage and Pyrus to implement no-code data analytics in Python. We have integrated nine independent technologies in two distinct Low-code development environments with the production of seven processes and pipelines, and the definition of 25 SIBs in nine distinct DSLs. The presented case study is benchmarked with the platform to showcase the role of code generation and the reusability of components across applications. We demonstrate that the approach embraces a high level of reusability and facilitates domain engineers to create IoT applications in a low-code fashion.

TI  - Improving the accuracy while preserving the interpretability of fuzzy function approximators by means of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms

AB  - The identification of a model is one of the key issues in the field of fuzzy system modeling and function approximation theory. An important characteristic that distinguishes fuzzy systems from other techniques in this area is their transparency and interpretability. Especially in the construction of a fuzzy system from a set of given training examples, little attention has been paid to the analysis of the trade-off between complexity and accuracy maintaining the interpretability of the final fuzzy system. In this paper a multi-objective evolutionary approach is proposed to determine a Pareto-optimum set of fuzzy systems with different compromises between their accuracy and complexity. In particular, two fundamental and competing objectives concerning fuzzy system modeling are addressed: fuzzy rule parameter optimization and the identification of system structure (i.e. the number of membership functions and fuzzy rules), taking always in mind the transparency of the obtained system. Another key aspect of the algorithm presented in this work is the use of some new expert evolutionary operators, specifically designed for the problem of fuzzy function approximation, that try to avoid the generation of worse solutions in order to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm.

TI  - Bayesian Takagi-Sugeno-Kang Fuzzy Model and Its Joint Learning of Structure Identification and Parameter Estimation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a novel Bayesian Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (BTSK) fuzzy model and its joint /earning method BTSK-JL of structure identification and parameter estimation are proposed for regression tasks from the perspective of Bayesian inference framework with a prior assumption about the number of fuzzy rules. Unlike most of existing TSK fuzzy systems where both their structure identification and parameter estimation of each fuzzy rule involved in them are learnt in a separate manner, BTSK-JL can determine the number of fuzzy rules and antecedent/consequent parameters of rules simultaneously in the proposed model. In order to guarantee their optimal solutions, BTSK-JL adopts a particle filter method to find the maximum-a-posterior value of the parameters. Due to taking into account the subtle interaction between input and output spaces, BTSK-JL can obtain good predictive performance and a set of compact fuzzy rules. Fuzziness and probability can work complementarily rather than competitively for such a TSK fuzzy system modeling. Experimental results on four time-series datasets and a glutamic acid fermentation process dataset have shown the validity and effectiveness of the proposed model.

CP  - International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS 2001)
CL  - San Francisco, CA
AB  - Fuzzy Inference Systems (FISs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), as two branches of Soft Computing Systems (SCSs) that pose a human-like inference and adaptation ability, have already proved their usefulness and have been found valuable for many applications [1],[2]. They share a common framework of trying to mimic the human way of thinking and provide an effective promising means of capturing the approximate, inexact nature of the real world process. In this paper we propose an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Logic Control approach (ANFLC) based on the neural network learning capability and the fuzzy logic modeling ability. The approach combines the merits of the both systems, which can handle quantitative (numerical) and qualitative (linguistic) knowledge. The development of this system will be carried out in two phases: The first phase involves training a multi-layered Neuro-Emulator network (NE) for the forward dynamics of the plant to be controlled; the second phase involves on-line learning of the Neuro-Fuzzy Logic Controller (NFLC). Extensive simulation studies of nonlinear dynamic systems are carreid out to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed scheme.

TI  - A Probabilistic-Based Approach for Detecting Simultaneous Load Redistribution Attacks Through Entropy Analysis and Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID
M3  - Article
AB  - Load redistribution attacks (LRAs) are one of the most sneaky and realistic types of false data injection attacks (FDIAs), in which the attacker manipulates the measurements in a way that depicts a false image of the system situation for the operator. Due to the uncertainty in the system's parameters, system modeling (AC or DC), and so on, detection LRAs have a lot of challenges. To overcome the difficulty of devising a general mechanism for LRA detection based on deterministic methods, we propose a probabilistic approach based on entropy analysis and deep learning. The ratio of cyber loads to real loads (RCLRLs) is the major input of the proposed detection algorithm to make the presented method applicable for different load levels in the system. By extracting the entropy of RCLRLs under LRAs, our method reduces dependency on system modeling and the system's parameters. We employ the bias correction method on forecasted loads to approximate the real load in the system, enhancing our approach's accuracy. The framework is a decentralized algorithm that detects simultaneous LRAs in different areas and ensures scalability for large systems. Simulations on the IEEE 118-bus systems demonstrate the proposed method's high accuracy and rapid response.

TI  - Moving Towards Industry 5.0 in the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Sector: Challenges and Solutions for Germany
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Emergence of industry 5.0 facilitates real-time synchronisation of production processes, which helps with the production of customized products. Although industry 5.0 can revolutionize the landscape of goods production, still its adoption is in the infancy stage. Hence, the purpose of this article is to examine barriers that impede the adoption of industry 5.0, and to propose solution initiatives (SIs). After an in-depth literature review and interviews with German industry experts in pharmaceutical sector, barriers and SIs are ranked using an integrated Analytical hierarchy process-elimination and choice expressing reality-decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (AHP-ELECTRE-DEMATEL) approach. "Linking virtual reality and reality" is found to be the most critical deterrent to the adoption of industry 5.0, and falls into a causal group, which signifies their influence on other deterrents. "Measures for better connectivity with patients" is of utmost importance for German firms to ensure secure communication and safeguard patient data. The findings also highlight the problems with the adoption of high-tech innovations due to lack of standardization and fair benchmarking policies on industry 5.0. This article concludes by proposing an industry 5.0 framework. The inhibitors to adopting industry 5.0 were investigated in this article, the results of which will assist practitioners and decision makers to understand the issues with industry 5.0. The results of this article will help potential adopters of this technology to look for the SIs. This will therefore pave the path for effective adoption of industry 5.0 across the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector.

TI  - Exploring the role of simulator fidelity in the safety validation of learning-enabled autonomous systems
T2  - AI MAGAZINE
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - This article presents key insights from the New Faculty Highlights talk given at AAAI 2023, focusing on the crucial role of fidelity simulators in the safety evaluation of learning-enabled components (LECs) within safety-critical systems. With the rising integration of LECs in safety-critical systems, the imperative for rigorous safety and reliability verification has intensified. Safety assurance goes beyond mere compliance, forming a foundational element in the deployment of LECs to reduce risks and ensure robust operation. In this evolving field, simulations have become an indispensable tool, and fidelity's role as a critical parameter is increasingly recognized. By employing multifidelity simulations that balance the needs for accuracy and computational efficiency, new paths toward comprehensive safety validation are emerging. This article delves into our recent research, emphasizing the role of simulation fidelity in the validation of LECs in safety-critical systems.

T2  - SMART STRUCTURES AND MATERIALS 2001: MODELING, SIGNAL PROCESSING, AND CONTROL IN SMART STRUCTURES
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Smart Structures and Materials 2001 Conference
CL  - NEWPORT BEACH, CA
AB  - This paper provides an account of a student research project conducted under the sponsoring of the National Science Foundation (NSF) program on Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) in Mechatronics and Smart Structures in the summer of 2000. The objective of the research is to design and test a stand-alone controller for a vibration isolation/suppression system. The design specification for the control system is to suppress the vibrations induced by the external disturbances by at least five times and hence to achieve vibration isolation. Piezo-electric sensors and actuators are utilized for suppression of unwanted vibrations. Various steps such as modeling of the system, controller design, simulation, closed-loop testing using d-Space rapid prototyping system, and analog control implementation are discussed in the paper. Procedures for data collection, the trade-offs carried out in the design, and analog controller implementation issues are also presented in the paper. The performances of various controllers are compared. The experiences of an undergraduate student are summarized in the conclusion of the paper.

TI  - ThreatInsight: Innovating Early Threat Detection Through Threat-Intelligence-Driven Analysis and Attribution
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The complexity and ongoing evolution of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) compromise the efficacy of conventional cybersecurity measures. Firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software, which are dependent on static rules and predefined signatures, are increasingly ineffective against these sophisticated threats. Moreover, the use of system audit logs for threat hunting involves a retrospective review of cybersecurity incidents to reconstruct attack paths for attribution, which affects the timeliness and effectiveness of threat detection and response. Even when the attacker is identified, this method does not prevent cyber attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce ThreatInsight, a novel early-stage threat detection solution that minimizes reliance on system audit logs. ThreatInsight detects potential threats by analyzing IPs captured from HoneyPoints. These IPs are processed through threat data mining and threat feature modeling. By employing fact-based and semantic reasoning techniques based on the APT Threat Intelligence Knowledge Graph (APT-TI-KG), ThreatInsight identifies and attributes attackers. The system generates analysis reports detailing the threat knowledge concerning IPs and attributed attackers, equipping analysts with actionable insights and defense strategies. The system architecture includes modules for HoneyPoint IP extraction, Threat Intelligence (TI) data analysis, attacker attribution, and analysis report generation. ThreatInsight facilitates real-time analysis and the identification of potential threats at early stages, thereby enhancing the early detection capabilities of cybersecurity defense systems and improving overall threat detection and proactive defense effectiveness.

TI  - Application of statistical information criteria for optimal fuzzy model construction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Theoretical studies have shown that fuzzy models are capable of approximating any continuous function on a compact domain to any degree of accuracy, However, constructing a good fuzzy model requires finding a good tradeoff between fitting the training data and keeping the model simple. A simpler model is not only easily understood, but also less likely to overfit the training data. Even though heuristic approaches to explore such a tradeoff for fuzzy modeling have been developed, few principled approaches exist in the literature due to the lack of a well-defined optimality criterion. In this paper, we propose several information theoretic optimality criteria far fuzzy models construction hv extending three statistical information criteria: 1) the Akaike information criterion (AIC); 2) the Bhansali-Downham information criterion (BDIC); and 3) the Schwarz-Rissanen information criterion (SRIC). We then describe a principled approach to explore the fitness-complexity tradeoff using these optimality criteria together with a fuzzy model reduction technique based on the singular value decomposition (SVD). The role of these optimality criteria in fuzzy modeling is discussed and their practical applicability is illustrated using a nonlinear system modeling example.

TI  - A new paradigm for parameter estimation in system modeling
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADAPTIVE CONTROL AND SIGNAL PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we consider a basic problem in system identification, that of estimating the unknown parameters of a given model by using input/output data. Available methods (extended Kalman filtering, unscented Kalman filtering, particle filtering, maximum likelihood, prediction error method, etc.) have been extensively studied in the literature, especially in relation to consistency analysis. Yet, other important aspects, such as computational complexity, have been somewhat overlooked so that, when such methods are used in practical problems, remarkable drawbacks may arise. This is why parameter estimation is often performed using empirical procedures. This paper aims to revisit the issue of setting up an estimator that is able to provide reliable estimates at low computational cost. In contrast to other paradigms, the main idea in the new introduced two-stage estimation method is to retrieve the estimator through simulation experiments in a training phase. Once training is terminated, the user is provided with an explicitly given estimator that can be used over and over basically with no computational effort. The advantages and drawbacks of the two-stage approach as well as other traditional paradigms are identified with an illustrative example. A more concrete example of tire parameter estimation is also provided. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - MEADEP is a user-friendly dependability-evaluation tool for measurement-based analysis of critical systems. MEADEP consists of 4 software modules:a data preprocessor for converting data in various formats to the MEADEP format,a data analyzer for graphical data-presentation and parameter estimation,a graphical modeling interface for building block diagrams (including the exponential block, Weibull block, and k-out-of-n block) and Markov reward chains,a model-solution module for availability/reliability calculations with graphical parametric analysis.Use of the tool on failure data. from measurements provides quantitative evaluations of dependability for the target system, while greatly reducing requirements for specialized skills in data-analysis and system-modeling from the user. MEADEP has been applied to evaluate availability for two air-traffic-control systems based on operational failure data; the results have provided valuable feedback to the project management of these critical systems. MEADEP has been used to analyze a. nuclear power-plant safety model, based on the Eagle 21 architecture and its early field-failure data. The study identified the most sensitive parameter and its most sensitive value segment to the plant mean time between hazards.

TI  - Evolutionary neural trees for modeling and predicting complex systems
T2  - ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling and predicting the behavior of many technical systems is complicated because they are generally characterized by a large number of variables, parameters and interactions, and limited amounts of collected data. This paper investigates an evolutionary method for learning models of such systems. The models thus evolved are based on trees of heterogeneous neural units. The set of different neuron types is defined by the application domain, and the specific type of each unit is determined during the evolutionary learning process. The structure, size, and weights of the neural trees are also adapted by evolution. Since the genetic search used for training does nor require error derivatives, a wide range of neural models can be constructed. This generality is contrasted with various existing methods for complex system modeling, which investigate only restricted topological subsets rather than the complete class of architectures. An improvement in the predictive accuracy and parsimony of models is reported, against backpropagation networks and other well-engineered polynomial-based methods for two problems: MacKey-Glass and Lorenz-like chaotic systems. The authors also demonstrate the importance of the selection pressure towards model parsimony for the improvement of prediction accuracy. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - In measurement systems there is an often need Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) neural network has some attractive features. The most important ones are its extremely fast learning capability and the special architecture that lets effective digital hardware implementation possible. All these properties may be important in measurement systems, e.g. in system modeling or in complex sensor's system, etc. Although the CMAC architecture was proposed in the. middle of the seventies, several open questions have been left even for today. Among them the most important ones are about its modeling and generalization capabilities. The limits of its modeling capability were addressed in the literature and recently a detailed analysis of its generalization properties was given. The results show that there are significant differences between the one-dimensional and the multidimensional versions of CMAC The modeling capability of a multidimensional network is inferior to that of the one-dimensional one. This paper discusses the reasons of this difference and suggests a new interpretation of CMAC. This interpretation is based on kernel machines. The paper shows that a one-dimensional binary CMAC can be considered as a kernel machine with linear B-spline kernel function. However this close relation cannot be found in multidimensional case. The paper proposes a version of multidimensional CMAC, which - similarly to the one-dimensional case - can be considered as a kernel machine. The paper introduces this interpretation and details its most important advantages.

TI  - Linking hydrological simulation models with workflow and optimisation software
T2  - 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2011)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - MSSANZ 19th Biennial Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)
CL  - Perth, AUSTRALIA
AB  - The literature is rich in discussion of methods, platforms and standards that hope to ease the process of integrating models in workflows or decision support systems. The reality for practitioners is that integrating models is still complex and time consuming in most cases. In addition, the literature contains few descriptions of the practicalities of integrating models in the hydrology domain. This paper presents two case studies to explore opportunities for reducing the complexity associated with model integration. Even though the case studies were different, significant commonalities exist in the linkage requirements for both case studies. The paper finds that meeting these requirements required significant change to the existing model architecture.The first case study involves linking the hydrological modeling system, Source IMS, with the Delft Flood Early Warning System (FEWS). The FEWS system is being trialed in the Australian Water Resources Assessment system (AWRA) that the Water Information Research and Development Alliance (WIRADA) is developing to support water assessment and water accounts products for the Bureau of Meteorology. The second case study involves linking the Source IMS with Parameter ESTimation (PEST) software for automated calibration of model parameters. These two case studies identified four key requirements that are considered common to how workflow tools would need to integrate with Source IMS. Specifically,1. Run and retrieve results without a user's interaction.2. Model independence - both FEWS and PEST remain independent of the model.3. Manipulate parameters and boundary conditions; there was no need to modify the structure or configuration of the model.4. Manage project load times and overall simulation times.The architecture of Source IMS changed significantly to support mechanisms for simulation stepping, distributed execution, stay-alive functionality and parameter passing. Adopting The Open Modelling Interface (OpenMI) would have addressed these requirements. However, the start up costs of implementing the OpenMI made this solution unachievable in the short term with the available resourcing. This paper discusses a pragmatic solution that addressed the key integration requirements while reducing the cost of moving to OpenMI in the future. The pragmatic solution involved changes such as:Refactoring persistence functions (load and save), data model parameterisation and simulation methods so they were brokered through the application layer interfaces;Decorating the application layer interfaces with Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) to enable inter-program, cross-process and cross-computer communication; andDeveloping a command-line client and server application for providing application layer services to external programs.Practitioners and software developers solving model integration problems desire to leverage standards such as OpenMI. This paper contributes to our understanding of the precursor steps required to implement some of these standards. The precursor to integrating hydrological models in Source IMS was a reengineering of the software architecture. The reengineered architecture supported requirements of both case studies due to commonalities of PEST and FEWS. This paper encourages practitioners to consider major architectural decisions that might simplify or complicate the integration with other products.

CL  - Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, AUSTRIA
AB  - This paper focuses on the issues and challenges that are encountered in the area of modeling, identification and state estimation of environmental and economic systems. It is argued that the traditional modeling and identification approach is not appropriate for the highly complex systems that we deal with nowadays in environmental science and economics. We propose that the researchers shift their attention and efforts from attempting to actually develop system models to designing algorithms that get the machine to learn about the behavior of the system. We attempt to make the case that traditional modeling techniques do not work for complex systems by introducing the notion of 'hard' and 'soft' variables. The advantages of machine learning theory and how it can be used to assess the quality of a given model (or learning machine) are discussed. A new approach that implements the notion of VC dimension and the principle of structural risk minimization is proposed to link system macro-descriptions to agent-based models. The techniques of support vector machines and kernel learning are discussed, and explanations as to how kernels can reproduce the knowledge expressed in (empirical and universal) laws are provided. Finally, a small application to the problem of spatial downscaling of the GDP aggregate data is presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Software-hardware embedded system reliability modeling with failure dependency and masked data
T2  - COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional system reliability models often ignore failure dependency between subsystems and the existence of system failure masked data, thereby they can't accurately reflect the reliability modeling analysis of the whole system. This paper investigates an embedded system that comprises software subsystems and hardware sub-systems. In order to more accurately assess the embedded system's reliability, we proposed a reliability super-position model of the software-hardware system with masked data and failure dependency. In the model, the influence of masked failure data and failure dependency between the hardware subsystem and software sub-system is considered in system reliability evaluation, and the influence of fault dependence is solved by Copula function. Estimating the parameters of this model is a challenging task due to the complexity of the parameters. With regards to this, we proposed an immune particle swarm optimization algorithm with enhanced learning ability (IPSO-ELA), which is used to calculate the parameter's estimation. Additionally, we investigated the impact of varying degrees of failure dependence on system reliability. Finally, the numerical experiment shown that the proposed model, which considers failure dependency among subsystems, outperforms other reliability models that do not. It can be seen from the experimental fitting results and the reliability trend charts that the system reliability when failure dependence is considered is higher than isn't considered, which is more realistic.

TI  - Towards Secured Online Monitoring for Digitalized GIS Against Cyber-Attacks Based on IoT and Machine Learning
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) has an important role in the growth and development of digitalized electric power stations while offering ambitious opportunities, specifically real-time monitoring and cybersecurity. In this regard, this paper introduces a novel IoT architecture for the online monitoring of the gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) status instead of the traditional observation methods. The proposed IoT architecture is derived from the concept of the cyber-physic system (CPS) in Industry 4.0. However, the cyber-attacks and the classification of the GIS insulation defects represent the main challenges against the implementation of IoT topology for the online monitoring and tracking of the GIS status. For this purpose, advanced machine learning techniques are utilized to detect cyber-attacks to conduct the paradigm and verification. Different test scenarios on various defects in GIS are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IoT architecture. Partial discharge pulse sequence features are extracted for each defect to represent the inputs for IoT architecture. The results confirm that the proposed IoT architecture based on the machine learning technique, that is the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), can visualize all defects in the GIS with different alarms, besides showing the cyber-attacks on the networks effectively. Furthermore, the defects of GIS and the fake data due to the cyber-attacks are recognized and presented on the dashboard of the proposed IoT platform with high accuracy and more clarified visualization to enhance the decision-making about the GIS status.

TI  - Variable projection algorithms with sparse constraint for separable nonlinear models
T2  - CONTROL THEORY AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Separable nonlinear models are widely used in various fields such as time series analysis, system modeling, and machine learning, due to their flexible structures and ability to capture nonlinear behavior of data. However, identifying the parameters of these models is challenging, especially when sparse models with better interpretability are desired by practitioners. Previous theoretical and practical studies have shown that variable projection (VP) is an efficient method for identifying separable nonlinear models, but these are based on L2 penalty of model parameters, which cannot be directly extended to deal with sparse constraint. Based on the exploration of the structural characteristics of separable models, this paper proposes gradientbased and trust-region-based variable projection algorithms, which mainly solve two key problems: how to eliminate linear parameters under sparse constraint; and how to deal with the coupling relationship between linear and nonlinear parameters in the model. Finally, numerical experiments on synthetic data and real time series data are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

TI  - Modeling and optimization of multi-energy systems in mixed-use districts: A review of existing methods and approaches
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - About 75% of the world's energy consumption takes place in cities. Although their large energy consumption attracts a large number of research projects, only a small fraction of them deal with approaches to model energy systems of city districts. These are particularly complex due to the existence of multiple energy sectors (multienergy systems, MES), different consumption sectors (mixed-use), and different stakeholders who have many different interests.This contribution is a review of the characteristics of energy system models and existing modeling tools. It evaluates current studies and identifies typical characteristics of models designed to optimize MES in mixed-use districts. These models operate at a temporal resolution of at least 1 h, follow either bottom-up or hybrid analytical approaches and make use of mixed-integer programming, linear or dynamic.These characteristics were then used to analyze minimum requirements for existing modeling tools. Thirteen of 145 tools included in the study turned out to be suitable for optimizing MES in mixed-use districts. Other tools where either created for other fields of application (12), do not include any methodology of optimization (39), are not suitable to cover city districts as a geographical domain (44), do not include enough energy or demand sectors (20), or operate at a too coarse temporal resolution (17). If additional requirements are imposed, e.g. the applicability of non-financial assessment criteria and open source availability, only two tools remain.Overall it can be stated that there are very few modeling tools suitable for the optimization of MES in mixeduse districts.

TI  - A systematic approach to fuzzy modeling for rule generation from numerical data
T2  - NAFIPS 2004: ANNUAL MEETING OF THE NORTH AMERICAN FUZZY INFORMATION PROCESSING SOCIETY, VOLS 1AND 2: FUZZY SETS IN THE HEART OF THE CANADIAN ROCKIES
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Annual Meeting of the North-American-Fuzzy-Information-Processing-Society
CL  - Banff, CANADA
AB  - This paper addresses a new method for automatically extraction of the fuzzy rules from input-output data. The proposed fuzzy system modeling approach has three significant modules: (1) Input selection, (2) Knowledge representation, and (3) Approximate reasoning. In the first module, a heuristic method is presented to select more significant input variables among the possible candidates. We decrease the number of inputs one by one, with improving a given criterion by implementing a Neural Network. In the second module, the data set is partitioned into several clusters according to their similarities. In this phase, we generalize Kwon index by using covariance norm matrix and implement the Gustafson-Kessel (GK) fuzzy clustering Algorithm. Then, the results of fuzzy clusters are used for generation of fuzzy IF-THEN rules, and the membership functions of corresponding rules are optimized by Neural Networks. The third module is parameterized inference formulation and optimization by implementing "Sequential Quadratic Programming" algorithm. In this framework, the whole procedure of structure identification and parameter optimization is carried out automatically and efficiently by the combined use of neural networks, fuzzy clustering, and an adaptive back-propagation learning. Finally, the proposed fuzzy methodology is implemented in supply chain of an automotive plant. The results show the superiority of the model in comparison with the Sugeno and Yasukawa's fuzzy modeling in terms of error reduction.

TI  - Propagation and control of stochastic signals through universal learning networks
T2  - NEURAL NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - The way of propagating and control of stochastic signals through Universal Learning Networks (ULNs) and its applications are proposed. ULNs have been already developed to form a superset of neural networks and have been applied as a universal framework for modeling and control of non-linear large-scale complex systems.However, the ULNs cannot deal with stochastic variables. Deterministic signals can be propagated through a ULN, but the ULN does not provide any stochastic characteristics of the signals propagating through it.The proposed method named Probabilistic Universal Learning Networks (PrULNs) can process stochastic variables and can train network parameters so that the signals behave with the pre-specified stochastic properties.As examples of applications of the proposed method, control and identification of non-linear dynamic systems with noises are studied, and it is shown that the method are useful for dealing with the control and identification of the non-linear stochastic systems contaminated with noises.

TI  - A neuro-fuzzy system modeling with self-constructing rule generation and hybrid SVD-based learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a novel approach for neuro-fuzzy system modeling. A neuro-fuzzy system for a given set of input-output data is obtained in two steps. First, the data set is partitioned automatically into a set of clusters based on input-similarity and output-similarity tests. Membership functions associated with each cluster are defined according to statistical means and variances of the data points included in the cluster. Then, a fuzzy IF-THEN rule is extracted from each cluster to form a fuzzy rule-base. Second, a fuzzy neural network is constructed accordingly and parameters are refined to increase the precision of the fuzzy rule-base. To decrease the size of the search space and to speed up the convergence, we develop a hybrid learning algorithm which combines a recursive singular value decomposition-based least squares estimator and the gradient descent method. The proposed approach has advantages of determining the number of rules automatically and matching membership functions closely with the real distribution of the training data points. Besides, it learns faster, consumes less memory, and produces lower approximation errors than other methods.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - Nowadays, with the expansion of terrorist operations around the world and also the dangers of accidental explosions, the need to design structures resistant to this phenomenon for the protection and safety of its citizens is inevitable. Tall buildings are one of the most important issues because of which those behavior should be investigated against the blast loading.Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, the authors used a simple method for investigating the dynamic response of tall buildings with the combined system of framed tube, shear core and outrigger-belt truss located at different heights of the building's that were subjected to blast loading. This proposed model is based on the development of a continuum model and the ruling equations that have been obtained using the energy principle predict the whole structure idealized as a shear and flexural cantilever beam with rotational springs at the belt truss location.Findings - The mathematical procedure shows a good understanding of the structural behavior and is suitable for a quick evaluation during the preliminary design stage, which requires less time. Moreover, it was concluded that the present blast load idealization can be used to reasonably assess the response of tall buildings subjected to blast load.Originality/value - The comparative analysis in this paper could give other engineers a simple analysis method for the preliminary analysis and design of tall building analysis. Numerical example is given to illustrate the ease of application and the accuracy of the suggested model.

TI  - Long Short-Term Memory-Based Prediction Solution Inside a Decentralized Proactive Historian for Water Industry 4.0
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Improvement possibilities of industrial systems are driven by Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Industry 4.0 concepts. The basic enablers are related to interoperation, and some efficiency and safety increasing solutions may be direct outcomes. Other benefits of interoperability are related to data integration, and the ability to analyze the collected information and to establish recipes for improvements. One of the most important targets required by the industry is the prediction capability, to forecast equipment faults or process values. The water industry with its specific characteristics is following the same path and needs efficiency increasing solutions that could be applied on its many legacy systems. Any data-driven solution is a case study driven solution. Therefore, the current research is started with deploying pilots that consists of proactive historians applied to functioning legacy water sector facilities. The work is presenting a Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) neural networks-based prediction solution within the low-cost decentralized proactive historian. The exposed case study technological process is a wastewater treatment plant, where sludge pump failures are predicted to improve maintenance activities, as well as a chemical oxygen demand water quality indicator to improve process control strategy adjustments. The algorithm is generated as a result of a batch training and afterwards it is adapted also to incremental training. The solution is conceived for the hardware and software conditions of the proactive historian and the deployment within the real scenario proved excellent results, with the ability to provide 5 hours ahead correct predictions.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Due to the advancement in technologies and excessive usability of smartphones in various domains (e.g., mobile banking), smartphones became more prone to malicious attacks.Typing on the soft keyboard of a smartphone produces different vibrations, which can be abused to recognize the keys being pressed, hence, facilitating side-channel attacks. In this work, we develop and evaluate AlphaLogger- an Android-based application that infers the alphabet keys being typed on a soft keyboard. AlphaLogger runs in the background and collects data at a frequency of 10Hz/sec from the smartphone hardware sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer) to accurately infer the keystrokes being typed on the soft keyboard of all other applications running in the foreground. We show a performance analysis of the different combinations of sensors. A thorough evaluation demonstrates that keystrokes can be inferred with an accuracy of 90.2% using accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer.

TI  - Multi-FNN Identification Based on HCM Clustering and Evolutionary Fuzzy Granulation
T2  - International Journal of Control, Automation, and Systems
M3  - research-article
AB  - In this paper, we introduce a category of Multi-FNN (Fuzzy-Neural Networks) mod-els, analyze the underlying architectures and propose a comprehensive identification framework. The proposed Multi-FNNs dwell on a concept of ing and evolutionary fuzzy granulation, and exploit linear inference being treated as a generic inference mechanism. By this nature, this FNN model is geared toward capturing relationships between information granules known as fuzzy sets. The form of the information granules them-selves (in particular their distribution and a type of membership function) becomes an important design feature of the FNN model contributing to its structural as wel as parametric optimization. The identification environment uses clustering techniques (Hard C Means, HCM) and exploits genetic optimization as a vehicle of global optimization. The global optimization is augmented by more refined gradient-based learning mechanisms such as standard back-propagation. The HCM algorithm, whose role is to carry out preprocessing of the process data for system model-ing, is utilized to determine the structure of Multi-FNNs. The detailed parameters of the Multi-FNN (such as apexes of membership functions, learning rates and momentum coefficients) are adjusted using genetic algorithms. An aggregate performance index with a weighting factor is tive) abilities of the model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, two numeric data sets are experimented with. One is the numerical data coming from a description of a cer-tain nonlinear function and the other is NOx emission process data from a gas turbine power plant.

TI  - A systematic map on verification and validation of emergent behavior in software engineering research
T2  - FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Emergent behavior cannot be attributed to one individual system alone but arises in the interplay of various systems, components etc. Ensuring the correctness of emergent behavior is a well-known challenge that has been addressed by research in various subfields of software engineering.Objective: This paper aims at providing a unified view on the research activities conducted and research contributions made on verification and validation of emergent behavior.Methods: We have conducted a systematic mapping study on the topic of verification and validation of emergent behavior. We applied a combined search strategy using manual, database, and snowball search. In total we investigated 7211 papers, from these 168 relevant papers have been included and classified.Results: Results show an increasing interest in the topic of verification and validation of emergent behavior. As only little validation and evaluation research has been conducted, the field can be considered still immature. There exist different verification and validation techniques used in the various solution approaches such as model checking, simulation, or runtime monitoring. It stands out that even though research is published in different software engineering fields and subfields no verification or validation technique can be attributed solely to a single field.

AB  - A fast learning algorithm for training multilayer feedforward neural networks (FNN's) by using a fading memory extended Kalman filter (FMEKF) is presented first, along with a technique using a self-adjusting time-varying forgetting factor. Then a U-D factorization-based FMEKF is proposed to further improve the learning rate and accuracy of the FNN, In comparison with the backpropagation (BP) and existing EKF-based learning algorithms, the proposed U-D factorization-based FMEKF algorithm provides much more accurate learning results, : using fewer hidden nodes. It has improved convergence rate and numerical stability (robustness). In addition, it is less sensitive to start-up parameters (e.g., initial weights and covariance matrix) and the randomness in the observed data. It also has good generalization ability and needs less training time to achieve a specified learning accuracy. Simulation results in modeling and identification of nonlinear dynamic systems are given to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

TI  - ROBUST REGRESSION FOR DEVELOPING SOFTWARE ESTIMATION MODELS
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - To develop a good software estimation model fitted to actual data, the evaluation criteria of goodness of fit is necessary. The first major problem discussed here is that ordinary relative error used for this criterion is not suitable because it has a bound in the case of underestimation and no bound in the case of overestimation. We propose use of a new relative error called balanced relative error as the basis for the criterion and introduce seven evaluation criteria for software estimation models. The second major problem is that the ordinary least-squares method used for calculation of parameter values of a software estimation model is neither consistent with the criteria nor robust enough, which means that the solution is easily distorted by outliers. We propose a new consistent and robust method called the least-squares of inverted balanced relative errors (LIRS) and demonstrates its superiority to the ordinary least-squares method by use of five actual data sets. Through the analysis of these five data sets with LIRS, we show the importance of consistent data collection and development standarization to develop a good software sizing model. We compare goodness of fit between the sizing model based on the number of screens, forms, and files, and the sizing model based on the number of data elements for each of them. Based on this comparison, the validity of the number of data elements as independent variables for a sizing model is examined. Moreover, the validity of increasing the number of independent variables is examined.

TI  - Impulse activated sparse cell array network in non-linear autoregressive process modeling
T2  - SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces new neural network/ fuzzy logic architecture called the impulse activated sparse cell array network (IASCAN) architecture. The motivation behind and origins of the new architecture are discussed. Its performance in non-linear dynamic system modeling using the Mackey Glass process which exhibits chaotic behavior is compared with that of Adaptive-Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS). This is done by comparing the root mean squared errors (RMSE) using training and checking data sets after the networks are trained with data taken from simulations of the Mackey Glass process. The same data sets are used in training and checking of errors for both the ANFIS networks and the new architecture for a direct comparison of performance. The results shows that the RMSEs of the new architecture were lower than that of the ANFIS networks with standard configuration of the problem even after many epochs of training. The errors were shown to approach that of the new architecture for equivalent order models only after increasing the numbers of Membership Functions (MFs) in the ANFIS model after which it took an extremely long time comparatively to produce a solution. The method is also uniquely extensible to the practical solution of high order problems. There are also other features that make this new architecture very promising.

TI  - Adaptive Body Area Networks Using Kinematics and Biosignals
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing penetration of wearable and implantable devices necessitates energy-efficient and robust ways of connecting them to each other and to the cloud. However, the wireless channel around the human body poses unique challenges such as a high and variable path-loss caused by frequent changes in the relative node positions as well as the surrounding environment. An adaptive wireless body area network (WBAN) scheme is presented that reconfigures the network by learning from body kinematics and biosignals. It has very low overhead since these signals are already captured by the WBAN sensor nodes to support their basic functionality. Periodic channel fluctuations in activities like walking can be exploited by reusing accelerometer data and scheduling packet transmissions at optimal times. Network states can be predicted based on changes in observed biosignals to reconfigure the network parameters in real time. A realistic body channel emulator that evaluates the path-loss for everyday human activities was developed to assess the efficacy of the proposed techniques. Simulation results show up to 41% improvement in packet delivery ratio (PDR) and up to 27% reduction in power consumption by intelligent scheduling at lower transmission power levels. Moreover, experimental results on a custom test-bed demonstrate an average PDR increase of 20% and 18% when using our adaptive EMG- and heart-rate-based transmission power control methods, respectively. The channel emulator and simulation code is made publicly available at https://github.com/a-moin/wban-pathloss.

TI  - Failure rate analysis of jaw crusher using Weibull model
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART E-JOURNAL OF PROCESS MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary crusher is essential equipment employed for comminuting the mineral in processing plants. Any kind of failure of its components will accordingly hinder the performance of the plant. Therefore, to minimize sudden failures, analysis should be undertaken to improve performance and operational reliability of the crushers and its components. This paper considers the methods for analyzing failure rates of a jaw crusher and its critical components application of a two-parameter Weibull distribution in a mineral processing plant fitted using statistical tests such as goodness of fit and maximum likelihood estimation. Monte Carlo simulation, analysis of variance, and artificial neural network are also applied. Two-parameter Weibull distribution is found to be the best fit distribution using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Maximum likelihood estimation method is used to find out the shape and scale parameter of two-parameter Weibull distribution. Monte Carlo simulation generates 40 numbers of shape parameters, scale parameters, and time. Further, 40 numbers of Weibull distribution parameters are evaluated to examine the failure rate, significant difference, and regression coefficient using ANOVA. Artificial neural network with back-propagation algorithm is used to determine R-2 and is compared with analysis of variance.

TI  - Modeling and optimization of synergistic ozone-ultraviolet-chlorine process for reclaimed water disinfection: From laboratory tests to software simulation
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The ozone-ultraviolet (UV)-chlorine process is a highly effective method of disinfection in water reuse system, but currently still lacks precise quantification and accurate control. It is difficult to determine the dosage of each disinfectant because of the complex interactions that occur between disinfection units and the complicated mathematical calculation required. In this study, we proposed a dosage optimization model for ozone-UV-chlorine synergistic disinfection process. The model was able to identify the cost-effective doses of the disin-fectants under the constraints of microbial inactivation, decolorization, and residual chlorine retention re-quirements. Specifically, the simulation of microbial inactivation rates during synergistic disinfection process was accomplished through quantification of the synergistic effects between disinfection units and the intro-duction of enhancement coefficients. In order to solve this optimization model rapidly and automatically, a MATLAB-based software program with graphical user interface was developed. This software consisted of cali-bration unit, prediction unit, assessment unit, and optimization unit, and was able to simulate synergistic ozone-UV-chlorine process and identify the optimal dose of ozone, UV, and chlorine. Validation experiments revealed good agreements between the experimental data and the results calculated by the developed software. The developed software is believed to help the water reclamation plants improve disinfection efficiency and reduce the operational costs of synergistic disinfection processes.

TI  - A Methodology and Simulation-Based Toolchain for Estimating Deployment Performance of Smart Collective Services at the Edge
T2  - IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Research trends are pushing artificial intelligence (AI) across the Internet of Things (IoT)-edge-fog-cloud continuum to enable effective data analytics, decision making, as well as the efficient use of resources for QoS targets. Approaches for collective adaptive systems (CASs) engineering, such as aggregate computing, provide declarative programming models and tools for dealing with the uncertainty and the complexity that may arise from scale, heterogeneity, and dynamicity. Crucially, aggregate computing architecture allows for "pulverization": applications can be decomposed into many deployable micromodules that can be spread across the ICT infrastructure, thus allowing multiple potential deployment configurations for the same application logic. This article studies the deployment architecture of aggregate-based edge services and its implications in terms of performance and cost. The goal is to provide methodological guidelines and a model-based toolchain for the generation and simulation-based evaluation of potential deployments. First, we address this subject methodologically by proposing an approach based on deployment code generators and a simulation phase whose obtained solutions are assessed with respect to their performance and costs. We then tailor this approach to aggregate computing applications deployed onto an IoT-edge-fog-cloud infrastructure, and we develop a corresponding toolchain based on Protelis and EdgeCloudSim. Finally, we evaluate the approach and tools through a case study of edge multimedia streaming, where the edge ecosystem exhibits intelligence by self-organizing into clusters to promote load balancing in large-scale dynamic settings.

TI  - Near-Optimal Design of Safe Output-Feedback Controllers From Noisy Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - As we transition toward the deployment of data-driven controllers for black-box cyberphysical systems, complying with hard safety constraints becomes a primary concern. Two key aspects should be addressed when input-output data are corrupted by noise: how much uncertainty can one tolerate without compromising safety, and to what extent is the control performance affected? By focusing on finite-horizon constrained linear- quadratic problems, we provide an answer to these questions in terms of the model mismatch incurred during a preliminary identification phase. We propose a control design procedure based on a quasiconvex relaxation of the original robust problem and we prove that, if the uncertainty is sufficiently small, the synthesized controller is safe and near-optimal, in the sense that the suboptimality gap increases linearly with the model mismatch level. Since the proposed method is independent of the specific identification procedure, our analysis holds in combination with state-of-the-art behavioral estimators beyond standard least squares. The main theoretical results are validated by numerical experiments.

TI  - Premium Calculation for Insurance Businesses Based on Cyber Risks in IP-Based Power Substations
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Insurance is a promising risk transfer tool against switching cyberattacks on power grids that can disrupt operation and potentially lead to widespread outages. This paper emphasizes on a framework of premium calculation for cyber insurance businesses by modeling potential electronic intrusion with steady-state simulation results and its direct hypothesized impacts. The proposed actuarial framework models the operational monetary losses with the hypothesized power outages based on the cyber-reliability assessment and its expected mean time to restore power (MTTRP). The ruin probability is employed as the fundamental formula to determine the feasible insurance premium pool. Hypothesized spatial correlation studies on multiple substation contingencies associated with switching attacks have shown estimated operational losses and expected duration of power restoration, which is translated into the calculation of insurance premium. The proposed actuarial framework is validated using generalized IEEE test cases with modified parameters on substations. The potential implications of grid's hypothetical scenarios are discussed.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The latest generation of IoT systems incorporate machine learning (ML) technologies on edge devices. This introduces new engineering challenges to bring ML onto resource-constrained hardware, and complications for ensuring system security and privacy. Existing research prescribes iterative processes for machine learning enabled IoT products to ease development and increase product success. However, these processes mostly focus on existing practices used in other generic software development areas and are not specialized for the purpose of machine learning or IoT devices.This research seeks to characterize engineering processes and security practices for ML-enabled IoT systems through the lens of the engineering lifecycle. We collected data from practitioners through a survey (N=25) and interviews (N=4). We found that security processes and engineering methods vary by company. Respondents emphasized the engineering cost of security analysis and threat modeling, and trade-offs with business needs. Engineers reduce their security investment if it is not an explicit requirement. The threats of IP theft and reverse engineering were a consistent concern among practitioners when deploying ML for IoT devices. Based on our findings, we recommend further research into understanding engineering cost, compliance, and security trade-offs.

TI  - Digital twin-assisted intelligent anomaly detection system for Internet of Things
T2  - AD HOC NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices within the cyber-physical infrastructure has raised privacy and security concerns. This is because processing large amounts of data and extracting anomalous data cannot be imprecisely identified with the limited storage and processing capabilities of IoT devices. Against this backdrop, edge computing is a networking paradigm to reshape the next generation of IoT-based applications, which brings computation and data storage closer to the data sources. However, since edge servers are difficult to obtain security protections like in centralized data centers, this makes them more vulnerable to security attacks. To address this issue, we propose a novel digital twin system architecture in edge computing -based Internet of Things (IoT) networks, which allows efficient data processing for anomaly detection at the network edge. Digital twin is a replica of the real world in a virtual environment with continuous information exchange. Our digital twin -assisted solution gives a data -driven strategy against the cell outage and simulates the behavior and patterns of the physical assets in the digital world. Powered by data processing capabilities at the network edge, the proposed digital twin -assisted model can help extract features and behaviors, reduce noise from data generated in the network physical model, and filter out redundant data for a better characterization of the network physical model in the anomaly detection service. To this extent, the contributions in this paper are threefold: We first propose a novel digital twin -assisted anomaly detection framework that processes highdimensional data efficiently and improves the system performance despite the imbalanced classes. Second, we define an autoencoder-based threshold algorithm and evaluate the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier to implement self -learning capability into the digital twin for an accurate prediction. Third, we extract the features, dependencies, and relationships to apply the learned model to the new and unseen dataset for real-time monitoring and optimization and evaluate the performance of the proposed model with both real-time and historical data. Finally, we analyze the performance of different classifiers to validate our model. We use four different datasets and demonstrate that our solution outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy performance, AUC score, and ROC curve.

AB  - Industry 4.0 refers to the evolution in manufacturing from computerization to fully cyberphysical systems that exploit rich sensor data, adaptive real-time safety-critical control, and machine learning. An important aspect of this vision is the sensing and subsequent association of objects in the physical world with their cyber and virtual counterparts. In this paper we propose Visible Light Positioning (VLP) as an enabler for these Industry 4.0 applications. We also explore sensing techniques, including cameras (and depth sensors), and other light-based solutions for object positioning and detection along with their respective limitations. We then demonstrate an application of positioning for real time robot control in an interactive multiparty cyber-physical-virtual deployment. Lastly, based on our experience with this cyber-physical-virtual application, we propose Ray-Surface Positioning (RSP), a novel VLP technique, as a low cost positioning system for Industry 4.0.

TI  - Analytical Validation and Integration of CIC-Bell-DNS-EXF-2021 Dataset on Security Information and Event Management
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Contemporary culture presents a substantial obstacle for cyber security experts in the shape of software vulnerabilities, which, if taken advantage of, can jeopardize the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of any system. Data-driven and modern threat intelligence tools can enhance cyber security, bolster resilience, and foster innovation across cloud, multi-cloud, and hybrid platforms. As a result, performance evaluation and accuracy verification have become essential for Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) to prevent cyber threats. The SIEM system offers threat intelligence, reporting, and security incident management through the collection and analysis of event logs and other data sources that are specific to events and their context. We propose a hybrid strategy to address threat intelligence, reporting, and security incident management consisting of two layers that utilize a predefined set of characteristics. Here, we use RStudio to assess how well a hybrid intrusion detection system (HIDS) handles the CIC-Bell-DNS-EXF-2021 dataset. Furthermore, we have incorporated our developed model into Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis Methods (MCDM) to enhance the methods' ability to identify complex DNS exfiltration attacks using machine learning algorithms: RF-AHP (RA), KNN-TOPSIS (KT), GBT-VIKOR (GV), and DT-Entropy-TOPSIS (DET). We consider several factors during the work, including accuracy, absolute error, weighted average recall, weighted average precision, kappa value, logistic loss, and root mean square deviation (RMSD). We use the Machine-Automated Model function to integrate and validate the models. According to the findings, GV has the highest level of accuracy, with a rate of 99.52%, while KT has the lowest level of authenticity, with a rate of 93.65%. Furthermore, these findings illustrate enhanced performance metrics for multiclass classification in comparison to previous approaches.

TI  - Learning-Based Data Envelopment Analysis for External Cloud Resource Allocation
T2  - MOBILE NETWORKS & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - A mature cloud system needs a complete resource allocation policy which includes internal and external allocation. They not only enable users to have better experiences, but also allows the cloud provider to cut costs. In the other words, internal and external allocation are indispensable since a combination of them is only a total solution for whole cloud system. In this paper, we clearly explain the difference between internal allocation (IA) and external allocation (EA) as well as defining the explicit IA and EA problem for the follow up research. Although many researchers have proposed resource allocation methods, they are just based on subjective observations which lead to an imbalance of the overall cloud architecture, and cloud computing resources to operate se-quentially. In order to avoid an imbalanced situation, in previous work, we proposed Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to solve this problem; it considers all of a user's demands to evaluate the overall cloud parameters. However, although DEA can provide a higher quality solution, it requires more time. So we use the Q-learning and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to solve the imbalance problem and reduce computing time. As our simulation results show, the proposed DEA+Qlearning will provide almost best quality but too much calculating time.

AB  - This project is developing new simulation frameworks for the ns-3 discrete-event network simulator, a free and open-source research tool designed for use by computer communications network researchers. Simulation remains in heavy use for network research and education, because of its ease of use, reproducibility, availability, scalability, and ease of software development.  However, the workflow of a typical simulation study requires the user's careful attention to a number of best practices in methodology to ensure that the results are credible and reproducible by third parties and that errors are not introduced.   This project is building an automation framework for the ns-3 simulator that provides an environment that is more conducive to the creation of rigorous studies.  The automation framework guides the user to produce valid network simulation models by composition and consistency checking, and definition of experimental settings. The framework exercises control over large-scale simulation studies, and applies statistical methods for output data analysis and execution control. The framework also collect details required to reproduce the experiment and report results.  The framework also allows users to specify wide ranges of simulation network topologies, application traffic, and other parameters, allowing experiments to be conducted on a wide range of scenarios with minimal effort.  Finally, maintaining the ns-3 software, documentation, and dissemination activities continue.   The additions to ns-3, disseminated as open source software, are improving the methodology and credibility for future simulation-based network research.

TI  - CAREER:  Scheduling of Multiclass Queueing Networks via Fluid Models
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Due to the advent of highly complex manufacturing, communication, and computer systems, there has been an increased need for more complex and realistic mathematical models to analyze and control such systems. A particularly striking example is seen in semiconductor wafer fabrication, where one facility may manufacture multiple products which traverse a labyrinthine route consisting of hundreds of steps. Factors such as reentrant routing, varied processing speeds, setup times, and machine downtimes make such systems particularly difficult to evaluate and control.Fluid models in queueing can be thought of as a relaxation of an original multiclass queuing network which can provide crucial insight into the operation of complex reentrant systems. The proposed research plan involves exploring fluid model techniques for efficient scheduling of multiclass queuing models. First we propose developing robust and efficient algorithms for solving a fluid model control problem. Then we will develop techniques for translating the solution to the fluid control problem into a feasible near-optimal schedule for the original. Finally, we will test the applicability of our methods using realistic wafer fab data of practical size and scope, drawing on a partnership with International SEMATECH for fab data and benchmark simulation models.  The proposed education plan is tied in with the research plan and involves new course development and software development for undergraduate courses and graduate courses in operations research modeling and queueing theory.

TI  - A software reliability growth model for a distributed development environment
T2  - ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS IN JAPAN PART III-FUNDAMENTAL ELECTRONIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many software systems have been produced in host-concentrated development environments. At present, the software development environment has been changing into a distributed one because of the progress of WS (workstation) and network computing technology. Information network systems have also been expanding more and more with the progress of such network computing technology. For instance, basic CSSs (client/server systems) which have two-layer structure have been expanded to N layers, since such CSSs can be easily and rapidly introduced into software development processes at low cost. In this paper, we discuss a software reliability growth model which evaluates the software quality quantitatively in the system testing phase of the distributed development environment. In particular, the model assumes that the software system consists of n reused software components and m newly developed software components. We derive a new software reliability growth model which aids in management of the development of a quality and reliable software system in a distributed development environment. We introduce weight parameters into our model in order to represent the proportion of the total testing load for each software component. We also perform sensitivity analysis for various software reliability assessment measures by using the actual fault-detection count data. (C) 2000 Scripta Technica.

T2  - NEURAL NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - A time-varying learning algorithm for recurrent high order neural network in order to identify and control nonlinear systems which integrates the use of a statistical framework is proposed. The learning algorithm is based in the extended Kalman filter, where the associated state and measurement noises covariance matrices are composed by the coupled variance between the plant states. The formulation allows identification of interactions associate between plant state and the neural convergence. Furthermore, a sliding window-based method for dynamical modeling of nonstationary systems is presented to improve the neural identification in the proposed methodology. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method is assessed to a five degree of freedom (DOE) robot manipulator where based on the time-varying neural identifier model, the decentralized discrete-time block control and sliding mode techniques are used to design independent controllers and develop the trajectory tracking for each DOF.

TI  - PYGRID: A software development and assessment framework for grid-aware software defined networking
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions to connect Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) to the Internet to facilitate efficient resource management in smart cities. Smart grid is the evolutionary approach towards a more dynamic, situation-aware, and elastic power systems in smart cities. However, due to the huge scale, heterogeneity and complexity of the many interconnected cyber and physical devices, current network and security technologies are incapable of best serving these needs. Destructive attacks targeting these components such as Denial of Service (DoS) may fully use grid structure and disrupt its crucial service. Recent researches offer the use of modern Software Defined Networking (SDN) to solve synonymous Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) network and security challenges. These researches noted the lack of an adequate platform to simulate grid systems network infrastructure. Therefore, in this paper, we present PYGRID, a software development and assessment framework for grid-aware SDN. Additionally, a top level SDN application is developed in SDN-enabled smart grid network to demonstrate the effectiveness of such merger and to mitigate DoS attacks. PYGRID is developed using PYTHON, an OSI-approved open source language considering standard client and server industrial communication protocols. IEEE 14-bus power system is adopted to demonstrate the potent and effectiveness of the proposed solution. We conducted multiple experiments to validate the developed framework over 14-bus system using PYPOWER. To the best of our knowledge, the resulted platform may be considered the first completely open source implementation of a secure SDN enabled smart grid simulator.

TI  - An MDA approach for robotic-based real-time business intelligence applications
T2  - DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Industry 4.0, the fourth industrial revolution, has emerged from the convergence of robotics, automation, and the Internet of Things (IoT), transforming industrial processes with intelligent systems and digital integration. This revolution also brings with it Business Intelligence (BI) systems that enable the analysis of IoT and robotic data. The data architectures employed for BI in Industry 4.0 contexts are often intricate, typically comprising robots software, DBMSs, message brokers, and data stream management systems. Consequently, designing BI datacentric applications for Industry 4.0 presents a significant challenge. Inspired by the absence of modeling approaches for this type of application and by the well-established advantages of Model-Driven Architecture (MDA), this paper introduces a novel UML profile for realtime robotic data-driven BI applications. Our profile enables the representation of robotic and transactional data within a unified and consistent framework, enabling continuous queries over these streams. Additionally, we propose an automated method to implement UML class diagrams onto a technological stack featuring ROS, Apache Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Apache Flink. An experimental evaluation in the agricultural application domain confirms the merits of our approach.

TI  - A reference system of smart manufacturing talent education (SMTE) in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking smart manufacturing as a strategy for industrial development, China has put forward a people-oriented policy and launched a series of plans for smart manufacturing talent education (SMTE). The demand for smart manufacturing talents in ten priority areas and the industrial applications in China is very huge. Therefore, in this paper, a reference system of SMTE in China is presented, which includes discipline system, training system, practice system, and assessment system. In order to further refine the architecture of smart manufacturing system, a reference course system was proposed; the system contains seven layers, which are basic layer, technique layer, implementation layer, management layer, platform layer, application layer, and industrialization layer. Finally, nine stakeholders of the common operation body were investigated, and a reference implementation of SMTE in China was put forward. In this paper, the smart manufacturing talent education reference system, reference model, and related reference subsystems can be a very useful guideline for Chinese industry and education to design, set, and carry out the smart manufacturing talent education system. At the same time, the system has its reference value for the improvement of China's smart manufacturing system architecture.

TI  - MiSim: A Simulator for Resilience Assessment of Microservice-Based Architectures

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 22nd IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security (QRS)
CL  - Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Increased resilience compared to monolithic architectures is both one of the key promises of microservice-based architectures and a big challenge, e.g., due to the systems' distributed nature. Resilience assessment through simulation requires fewer resources than the measurement-based techniques used in practice. However, there is no existing simulation approach that is suitable for a holistic resilience assessment of microservices comprised of (i) representative fault injections, (ii) common resilience mechanisms, and (iii) time-varying workloads. This paper presents MiSim- an extensible simulator for resilience assessment of microservice-based architectures. It overcomes the stated limitations of related work. MiSim fits resilience engineering practices by supporting scenario-based experiments and requiring only lightweight input models. We demonstrate how MiSim simulates (1) common resilience mechanisms- i.e., circuit breaker, connection limiter, retry, load balancer, and autoscaler- and (2) fault injections- i.e., instance/service killing and latency injections. In addition, we use TeaStore, a reference microservice-based architecture, aiming to reproduce scaling behavior from an experiment by using simulation. Our results show that MiSim allows for quantitative insights into microservice-based systems' complex transient behavior by providing up to 25 metrics.

TI  - Defending AI Models Against Adversarial Attacks in Smart Grids Using Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Adversarial attacks involve manipulating data to trick Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, making false predictions or classifications or even disrupting the normal functions of the smart grid. This can be done by providing the wrong information to the models, hence producing wrong predictions and therefore leading to instabilities, power imbalances and overall operational failure. Thus, employing an AI model is vital for controlling energy usage, identifying and even predicting equipment failures, and accurately determining power availability. Thus, their input dependency does not enable them to withstand cyber-attacks, which compromises the stability of the grid. These attacks affect energy control, cause losses and intrude into the critical infrastructure part of the smart grid, hence the call for enhanced smart grid protection. This study first generates a novel adversarial attack dataset on smart grids with three attacks: adversarial perturbation, backdoor injection, DOS attacks, and one benign class. Next, it provides a fine-tuned Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to significantly improve resistance against adversarial attacks on smart grids. Results from the various Machine Learning (ML) and DNN algorithms showed accuracy varying between 29.10% to 73.9%, with DNN recording the highest levels of accuracy. This shows how the approach can be utilised in the prediction of such attacks and how the grid can be protected and secured.

AB  - Role-Based Collaboration (RBC) is a computational methodology that uses roles as the primary underlying mechanism to facilitate collaboration activities. It consists of a set of concepts, principles, models, processes, and algorithms.RBC and its Environments - Classes, Agents, Roles, Groups, and Objects (E-CARGO) model have been developed to a powerful tool for investigating collaboration and complex systems. Related research has brought and will bring in exciting improvements to the development, evaluation, and management of systems including collaboration, services, clouds, productions, and administration systems. RBC and E-CARGO grow gradually into a strong fundamental methodology and model for exploring solutions to problems of complex systems including Collective Intelligence, Sensor Networking, Scheduling, Smart Cities, Internet of Things, Cyber-Physical Systems, and Social Simulation Systems.E-CARGO assists scientists and engineering to formalize abstract problems, which originally are taken as complex problems, and finally points out solutions to such problems including programming. The E-CARGO model possesses all the preferred properties of a computational model. It has been verified by formalizing and solving significant problems in collaboration and complex systems, e.g., Group Role Assignment (GRA). With the help of E-CARGO, the methodology of RBC can be applied to solve various real-world problems. E-CARGO itself can be extended to formalize abstract problems as innovative investigations in research. On the other hand, the details of E-CARGO components are still open for renovations for specific fields to make the model easily applied. For example, in programming, we need to specify the primitive elements for each component of E-CARGO. When these primitive elements are well-specified, a new type of modelling/programming language can be developed and applied to solve general problems with software design and implementations.In this talk, the speaker examines the requirement of research on collaboration systems and technologies, discusses RBC and its model E-CARGO; reviews the related research achievements on RBC and E-CARGO in the past years; illustrates those problems that have not yet been solved satisfactorily; presents the fundamental methods to conduct research related to RBC and E-CRAGO and discover related problems; and analyzes their connections with other cutting-edge fields. This talk aims to inform the audience that E-CARGO is a well-developed model and has been investigated and applied in many ways. The speaker welcomes queries, reviews, studies, applications, and criticisms.As case studies of E-CARGO, GRA and its related problem models are inspired by delving into the details of the E-CARGO components and the RBC process. GRA can help solve related collaboration problems with the help of programming and optimization platforms. All the related Java codes can be downloaded by GitHub: https://github.com/haibinnipissing/E-CARGO-Codes. The speaker welcomes interested researchers and practitioners to use these codes in their research and practice and contact the speaker if there are any questions about them.

TI  - Quantitative risk assessment for connected automated Vehicles: Integrating improved STPA-SafeSec and Bayesian network
T2  - RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) risk assessment is of paramount significance, as it integrates safety and security factors to ensure dependable operation while effectively mitigating potential hazards and vulnerabilities. However, existing risk assessment methods suffer from two shortcomings: shying away from quantification and insufficiently considering threats. To this end, we propose a quantifiable risk assessment method, which incorporates the STRIDE threat model to address cybersecurity concerns within the context of CAVs. Specifically, we first present improved STPA-SafeSec for hazard analysis, using a generic causal factor diagram and STRIDE to identify causal factors, safety and security requirements, and the corresponding mitigations. Then, we propose a Bayesian Network for comprehensive quantification of system risk. This approach enables quantitative risk assessment, sensitivity analysis, prioritization of risk control measures, and benefit cost analysis that aided by a designed greedy optimization algorithm. A case study on a real open- source test vehicle demonstrates that the proposed method not only offers a comprehensive analysis of hazards and vulnerabilities, but also provides a quantitative risk assessment. Comparative assessments suggest that the proposed method exhibits a notable advantage in terms of analysis results (utility), analysis steps (usability), and the analysis process (efficiency) when compared to existing approaches.

TI  - Joint state and parameter estimation for a target-directed nonlinear dynamic system model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present a new approach to joint state and parameter estimation for a target-directed, nonlinear dynamic system model with switching states. The model, which was recently proposed for representing speech dynamics, is also called the hidden dynamic model (HDM). The model parameters subject to statistical estimation consist of the target vector and the system matrix (also called the "time-constants"), as well as the parameters characterizing the nonlinear mapping from the hidden state to the observation. These latter parameters are implemented in the current work as the weights of a three-layer feedforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) network. The new estimation approach presented in this paper is based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF), and its performance is compared with the more traditional approach based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Extensive simulation experiment results are presented using the proposed EKF-based and the EM algorithms and under the typical conditions for employing the HDM for speech modeling. The results demonstrate superior convergence performance of the EKF-based algorithm compared with the EM algorithm, but the former suffers from excessive computational loads when adopted for training the MLP weights. In all cases, the simulation results show that the simulated model output converges to the given observation sequence. However, only in the case where the MLP weights or the target vector are assumed known do the time-constant parameters converge to their true values. We also show that the MLP weights never converge to their true values, thus demonstrating the many-to-one mapping property of the feedforward MLP. We conclude from these simulation experiments that for the system to be identifiable, restrictions on the parameter space are needed.

TI  - HIDDEN CONTROL NEURAL ARCHITECTURE MODELING OF NONLINEAR TIME-VARYING SYSTEMS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multilayered neural networks have been proposed recently for nonlinear prediction and system modeling [1]-[6]. Although neural networks have proven.successful for modeling time invariant nonlinear systems, it has been difficult to apply them to complicated nonstationary signals, such as speech because they are unable to characterize temporal variability. In this paper we address this problem by proposing a network architecture, called ''hidden control neural network'' (HCNN) [4], for modeling signals generated by nonlinear dynamical systems with restricted time variability. Our approach is to allow the mapping that is implemented by a multilayered neural network to change with time as a function of an additional control input signal. This network is trained using an algorithm that is based on ''back-propagation'' and segmentation algorithms for estimating the unknown control together with the network's parameters. This network wa$ applied to three different tasks: segmentation and modeling of a signal produced by a time-varying nonlinear system; speaker-independent recognition of spoken connected digit; and on-line recognition of handwritten characters. The results of these experiments demonstrate the ability of HCNN to learn time-varying nonlinear dynamics, and its potential for high performance recognition of signals, produced by time-varying sources, such as spoken utterances, and written characters.

TI  - Iterative Learning Control of a Left Ventricular Assist Device
T2  - IFAC PAPERSONLINE
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 20th World Congress of the International-Federation-of-Automatic-Control (IFAC)
CL  - Toulouse, FRANCE
AB  - Due to the lack of donor organs, the importance of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) increases. State of the art is to operate the pumps with a constant speed (CS) leading to effects such as underpumping, ventricular suction or the backflow of blood from the aorta in the ventricle. The end-diastolic volume (EDV) is influenced by venous return, as well as diastolic function and systolic pressure development. Thus it is a good medical indicator of ventricular load. In this paper a norm-optimal iterative learning control (NOILC) algorithm is designed to shape the EDV of a pathological ventricle. In addition, further constraints such as for example a uniform filling of the ventricle and the prevention of pumping during the systole are considered. A simplified model of the systemic circulation and the pump is used to study the system response to changes in pulmonary vein pressure and to benchmark controller performance. The results show that the algorithm obtains an excellent tracking performance and prevents the dilation of the ventricle. The approach offers the physician the opportunity to control multiple physiological variables even though the optimal control output trajectory is not known. Future work will focus on the improvement of the controller performance regarding the rejection of instantaneous disturbances and the incorporation of variable cycle duration.

TI  - Infusing the use of seasonal climate forecasting into crop management practice in North East Australia using discussion support software
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal climate forecasting offers potential for improving management of crop production risks in the cropping systems of NE Australia. But how is this capability best connected to management practice? Over the past decade, we have pursued participative systems approaches involving simulation-aided discussion with advisers and decision-makers. This has led to the development of discussion support software as a key vehicle for facilitating infusion of forecasting capability into practice. In this paper, we set out the basis of our approach, its implementation and preliminary evaluation. We outline the development of the discussion support software Whopper Cropper, which was designed for, and in close consultation with, public and private advisers. Whopper Cropper consists of a database of simulation output and a graphical user interface to generate analyses of risks associated with crop management options. The charts produced provide conversation pieces for advisers to use with their farmer clients in relation to the significant decisions they face. An example application, detail of the software development process and an initial survey of user needs are presented. We suggest that discussion support software is about moving beyond traditional notions of supply-driven decision support systems. Discussion support software is largely demand-driven and can compliment participatory action research programs by providing cost-effective general delivery of simulation-aided discussions about relevant management actions. The critical role of farm management advisers and dialogue among key players is highlighted. We argue that the discussion support concept, as exemplified by the software tool Whopper Cropper and the group processes surrounding it, provides an effective means to infuse innovations, like seasonal climate forecasting, into farming practice.

TI  - Development of a cyber-physical experimental platform for real-time dynamic model updating
T2  - MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Model updating procedures are traditionally performed off-line. With the significant recent advances in embedded systems and the related real-time computing capabilities, online or real-time, model updating can be performed to inform decision making and controller actions. The applications for real-time model updating are mainly in the areas of (i) condition diagnosis and prognosis of engineering systems; and (ii) control systems that benefit from accurate modeling of the system plant. Herein, the development of a cyber-physical real-time model updating experimental platform, including real-time computing environment, model updating algorithm, hardware architecture and testbed, is described. Results from two challenging experimental implementations are presented to illustrate the performance of this cyber-physical platform in achieving the goal of updating nonlinear systems in real-time. The experiments consider typical nonlinear engineering systems that exhibit hysteresis. Among the available algorithms capable of identification of such complex nonlinearities, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is selected for these experiments as an effective method to update nonlinear dynamic system models under realistic conditions. The implementation of the platform is discussed for successful completion of these experiments, including required timing constraints and overall evaluation of the system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - WaterNet: A Network for Monitoring and Assessing Water Quality for Drinking and Irrigation Purposes
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is a fundamental requirement for human, animal, and plant survival. Despite its importance, quality water is not always fit for drinking, domestic and/or industrial use. Numerous factors such as industrialization, mining, pollution, and natural occurrences impact the quality of water, as they introduce or alter various parameters present therein, thus, affecting its suitability for human consumption or general use. The World Health Organization has guidelines which stipulate the threshold levels of various parameters present in water samples intended for consumption or irrigation. The Water Quality Index (WQI) and Irrigation WQI (IWQI) are metrics used to express the level of these parameters to determine the overall water quality. Collecting water samples from different sources, measuring the various parameters present, and bench-marking these measurements against pre-set standards, while adhering to various guidelines during transportation and measurement can be extremely daunting. To this end this study proposes a network architecture to collect data on water parameters in real-time and use Machine Learning (ML) tools to automatically determine suitability of water samples for drinking and irrigation purposes. The developed monitoring network is based on LoRa and takes the land topology into consideration. Results of simulations done in Radio Mobile revealed a partial mesh network topology as the most adequate. Due to the absence of large and open datasets on drinking and irrigation water, datasets usable for training ML models were developed. Three ML models - Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were considered for the water classification process and results obtained showed that LR performed best for drinking water, while SVM was better suited for irrigation water. Recursive feature elimination was then combined with the three ML models to reveal which of the water parameters had the greatest influence on the classification accuracies of the respective model.

TI  - CPS:  Breakthrough: Wearables With Feedback Control
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Recently there is an increasing availability of smart wearables including smart watches, bands, buttons and pendants. Many of these devices are part of human-in-the-loop Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). With future fundamental advances in the intersection of communications, control, and computation for these energy and resource limited devices, there is a great potential to revolutionize many CPS applications. Examples of possible applications include detecting and controlling hand washing to prevent transmission of infections or bacteria, monitoring and using interventions to keep factory workers safe, detecting activities in the home for monitoring the elderly, and improving rehabilitation of stroke victims via controlled exercises. However, to date, much of the work on wearables concentrates on only sensing, collecting and presenting data. For use in CPS it is necessary to consider the increased use of new sensing modalities, to apply feedback to close the control loop, and to focus on the fundamental issues of how both the environment and human behavior affect the cyber. In particular, since humans are intimately involved with wearables it is necessary to increase understanding of how human behaviors affect and can be affected by the control loops and how the systems can maintain safety.This work develops generic underlying algorithms for processing smart wearable data rather than one-off solutions, it extends the understanding and control of wearable systems by addressing humans-in-the-loop behaviors, and it explicitly focuses on the impact of the environment and human behavior on the cyber. Novel ideas are proposed for each of these areas along with a structure for their integration. For example, the algorithmic approach to support more robust, accurate and efficient activity recognition using wearable devices is based on five fundamental concepts: (i) Direction Agnostic Modeling, (ii) Direction Aware Modeling, (iii) Spatial Reachability, (iv) Spatiotemporal Segmentation, and (v) Dynamic Space Time Warping. For dealing with humans-in the-loop behaviors, Model Predictive Control (MPC) is extended to semantic based MPC. This solves control problems that are not amenable to electromechanical laws and employs machine learning. Many CPS projects do not explicitly address how the uncertain world affects how the cyber must be developed in order to perform robustly and safely. A new *-aware software development paradigm focuses on physical-cyber CPS issues as central tenets and that serves as an integrating platform for all the proposed work. The *-aware paradigm focuses on how software must be made robust to handle the physical world, while meeting safety and adaptability requirements

TI  - Nonlinear system identification using Takagi-Sugeno type neuro-fuzzy model

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 2nd IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Systems
CL  - Varna, BULGARIA
AB  - Neuro-fuzzy (NF) modeling can be regarded as a gray-box technique on the boundary between neural networks and qualitative fuzzy models. The main motivation for this investigation is to develop an identification procedure for nonlinear systems and processes without having their complete information. The main problem in developing the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) type of neuro-fuzzy models is to identify the number of membership functions partitioning each input variable or the number of rules. Moreover, the neuro-fuzzy model of particular interest of type TS also has problem of poor initialization. In this paper, an algorithm for neuro-fuzzy modeling of nonlinear system identification is given, with an emphasis on the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability.The proposed algorithm not only solves the problem of poor initialization but also automatically identifies the optimal structure of the model and still gives the more accurate results in comparison to the standard neuro-fuzzy models. A two-step procedure of Takagi-Sugeno type neuro-fuzzy model is proposed here for nonlinear system modeling. In first step, a method of generation of optimal rule base is proposed and in the next step, based on the generated rule base, the structure of the neuro-fuzzy network is decided and thereafter, the constructed NF model is trained by improved Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA). The proposed scheme not only eliminates the usual "trial-and-error" mechanism of structure identification but also accelerates the learning process by good initialization of fuzzy membership functions and rules consequents. The proposed method is tested on various benchmark problems. The corresponding results show that a good modeling capability is achieved without employing any complicated optimization procedure for structure identification of neuro-fuzzy model.

TI  - Identification and prioritization of the challenges faced by vendor organizations in the shape of cyber security: A FUZZY-AHP -based systematic approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE-EVOLUTION AND PROCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this research study was to identify and prioritize the significant cybersecurity challenges that vendor firms encounter during software development. Using Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs), 13 significant challenges were found, including "Security issues/Access of Cyberattacks", "Lack of Right Knowledge", "Cost Security Issues", and "Lack of Confidentiality and Trust" among others. To address these concerns, a multifaceted strategy that prioritizes continuing education, training, and investment in cybersecurity measures, as well as cross-industry cooperation and coordination with government entities, is required. These challenges were ranked using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP). We obtained the following results after applying the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process: CSC1 (Cyber Security Challenge-1) "Security Issues/Access of Cyber Attacks", CSC2 "Lack of Right Knowledge", and CSC3 "Framework" are the top most critical cyber security challenges, with weightages of 0.1687, 0.1672, and 0.1194, respectively. This study lays the groundwork for future research and assists vendor organizations in addressing the cybersecurity concerns they face during software development. The study also emphasizes the significance of addressing cybersecurity during the software development process in order to avoid the financial and reputational losses associated with cyber intrusions.FIGURE 4.

TI  - GWAD: Greedy Workflow Graph Anomaly Detection Framework for System Traces
T2  - 2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - System traces are a collection of time-stamped messages recorded by the operating system while the system is running. Analysis of these traces is crucial for tasks such as system fault finding. Moreover, detecting anomalies in system behavior becomes crucial in safety-critical and time-sensitive systems where delayed detections can lead to catastrophic outcomes. Therefore, we focus on developing a lightweight and explainable approach for safety-critical time-sensitive systems.Given a set of system traces under normal conditions and anomalous conditions, trace-based anomaly detection aims at classifying the trace as anomalous or not. In this work, we introduce GWAD, a greedy workflow graph framework for anomaly detection, a novel greedy graph construction approach for both offline and online anomaly detection in system traces. Our approach utilizes both sequence of occurrence of events and the time interval between their occurrences in learning the normal system behavior. We propose two approaches, first for offline classification of the trace as anomalous or normal using the event occurrence workflow graphs and secondly an online streaming algorithm that monitors the events as they occur in real-time for detecting anomalies increasing system resilience. Our approach also provides reasoning for the cause of anomalous behavior. We show that GWAD is better than traditional state-of-the-art models. The paper shows the technical feasibility and viability of GWAD through multiple case studies using traces from a field-tested hexacopter.

TI  - Map algebra and model algebra for integrated model building
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Computer models are important tools for the assessment of environmental systems. A seamless work-flow of construction and coupling of model components is essential for environmental scientists. However, currently available software packages are often tailored either to the construction of model components, or to the coupling of existing components. Combining both objectives is not straightforward, because it requires merging concepts for model component building and model component coupling. Also, software packages should be usable for domain experts such as hydrologists or ecologists who do not necessarily have expert knowledge in programming.We propose an integrated modelling framework that provides descriptive means to specify (1) model components with conventional map algebra, and (2) interactions between model components with model algebra. A prototype implementation in a high-level scripting language supports the building of integrated spatio-temporal models. For a seamless coupling of model components with different temporal and spatial discretisation, we introduce the use of accumulators. These handle the temporal aggregation of model component outputs. The framework provides templates for the custom construction of model components and accumulators, and a management layer arranges the schedule for the execution of the integrated model. We use the prototype implementation of the framework in an illustrative case study to build an integrated model that couples model components simulating the interaction between biomass growth, wildfire, and human impacts with different temporal discretisations. The high-level Python language is used as model building environment to allow domain experts without in-depth knowledge of software development practices to conduct exploratory model construction and analysis.

TI  - Ensembles of Fuzzy Linear Model Trees for the Identification of Multioutput Systems
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - We address the task of discrete-time modeling of nonlinear dynamic systems with multiple outputs using measured data. In the area of control engineering, this task is typically converted into a set of classical regression problems, one for each output, which can then be solved with any nonlinear regression approach. Fuzzy models, in the Takagi-Sugeno form, are popular in this context. We use Lolimot, which is a tree learning method, to build fuzzy linearmodel trees. In this paper, we propose, implement, and empirically evaluate three extensions of fuzzy linear model trees. First, we consider and evaluate multioutput models. Second, we propose to use ensembles of such models. Third, we investigate the use of a search heuristic based on simulation error (as opposed to one-step-ahead prediction error), specific to the context of modeling dynamic systems. Finally, we perform an empirical evaluation and compare these approaches on six multioutput case studies, using both measured and simulated data, with noise: The case studies include modeling of the inverse dynamics of a robot arm, as well as five additional process-industry systems. Ensembles improve the performance of both single-and multioutput trees, while the heuristic specific to modeling dynamic systems only improves performance very slightly. Multioutput model trees exhibit comparable or worse predictive performance to a set of single-output models, while providing a more compact model. Overall, we can recommend the use of bagging of single-output Lolimot models, learned by using the simulation error as a search heuristic.

TI  - Convergence Accelerator Phase I(RAISE): Rapid Dissemination of AI Microcredentials through Hands-On Industrial Robotics Education (RD-AIM-HIRE)
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - The NSF Convergence Accelerator supports team-based, multidisciplinary efforts that address challenges of national importance and show potential for deliverables in the near future.  The broader impact/ potential benefit of this Convergence Accelerator Phase I project is to facilitate convergence of literature and methodologies from sociology, human-computer interaction, microcredentialing, software engineering, and improvement science to improve collaborative development and delivery processes for training robotics technicians who can meet the needs of American manufacturers both today and during the impending transition to an "Industry 4.0" paradigm in which factory floors are transformed into networked cyber-physical systems controlled by specialized artificial intelligence (AI) software. Technicians will remain critical in the installation and maintenance of advanced manufacturing systems, but they must understand such systems in order to troubleshoot them effectively. Good training is both authentic and consistently deliverable. Achieving this requires coordination between curriculum designers, subject matter experts, educational practitioners, and many other stakeholders. The endeavor has been approached alternately as a "product design" problem from the curriculum development perspective, or an "organizational coordination" problem from an organizational policy perspective. Our approach connects these two perspectives in a transdisciplinary effort to produce a technical training apparatus that can keep pace with rapid advancement in fields like machine learning and AI.This Convergence Accelerator Phase I project takes a design research approach to fusing the organizations-inward and product-outward approaches into a single efficient enterprise. Our project employs design and improvement science methods to answer questions about (i) How to design effective and deliverable machine learning (ML) curriculum for technician trainees with little or no STEM background; and (ii) How to design productive collaborative routines around this objective, given the wide variety of stakeholders. We start with a "shovel-ready" curriculum concept and an experienced production team that uses human-centered design (HCD) techniques to design usable, pedagogically effective activities. In addition to authorial consultation with AI subject matter experts, HCD involves data collection on instructors, learners, and their extended learning contexts including administrative and social aspects. We problematize collaboration patterns of the production team with other stakeholders during this process, identifying improved routines to accelerate the collaborative's joint work. This phase of the project produces knowledge of how to accelerate curriculum design through enhanced collaborative routines, knowledge of how ML/AI can be integrated into technician training, prototype ML/AI curriculum for non-four-year audiences, and direct training impact for pilot participants.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

TI  - Collaborative Research: Frameworks for NS-3
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - This project is developing new simulation frameworks for the ns-3 discrete-event network simulator, a free and open-source research tool designed for use by computer communications network researchers. Simulation remains in heavy use for network research and education, because of its ease of use, reproducibility, availability, scalability, and ease of software development. However, the workflow of a typical simulation study requires the user's careful attention to a number of best practices in methodology to ensure that the results are credible and reproducible by third parties and that errors are not introduced. This project is building an automation framework for the ns-3 simulator that provides an environment that is more conducive to the creation of rigorous studies. The automation framework guides the user to produce valid network simulation models by composition and consistency checking, and definition of experimental settings. The framework exercises control over large-scale simulation studies, and applies statistical methods for output data analysis and execution control. The framework also collect details required to reproduce the experiment and report results. The framework also allows users to specify wide ranges of simulation network topologies, application traffic, and other parameters, allowing experiments to be conducted on a wide range of scenarios with minimal effort. Finally, maintaining the ns-3 software, documentation, and dissemination activities continue. The additions to ns-3, disseminated as open source software, are improving the methodology and credibility for future simulation-based network research.

TI  - A technological framework for data-driven IoT systems: Application on landslide monitoring
T2  - COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of the paradigm of the Internet of Things has underpinned the development of data-driven cyber-physical systems that collect and process data that is dense both in space and time. The application areas of such data-driven IoT systems are numerous and their socio-economic impact of great importance as they enable the monitoring and management of processes in sectors ranging from urban management to management of the natural environment. In this work, we introduce and detail an end-to-end technological framework for data-driven IoT systems for landslide monitoring. The framework is articulated in three tiers - namely data acquisition, data curation and data presentation For each tier we present and detail its design and development aspects; from the IoT hardware design and the wireless communication technologies of choice, to how Big Data infrastructure and Machine Learning components can be combined to support a sophisticated presentation tier that delivers the true added value of a system to its final users. The framework is validated, extended and fine-tuned by means of two pilots at locations experiencing the impact of different landslide types and activity. This work qualitatively improves upon existing methods of landslide monitoring and showcases how data-driven IoT systems can pave new pathways for interdisciplinary research as well as generate positive impact on modern societies.

TI  - Applying system dynamics approach in software and information system projects: A mapping study
T2  - INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Software and information system are everywhere and the projects involving them are becoming more complex. However, these projects performance patterns are not showing improvement or convergence over time. Additionally, there is a growing interest in modeling the complexities involved in such projects for evaluating long-term impacts, especially the dynamic dimension.Objective: This study aims to analyze how the system dynamics approach has been used in the scientific literature to model complexity in software and information system projects.Method: The research approach used was a mapping study that combined bibliometrics and content analysis to draw the scenario of the research literature related to software and information system projects, identifying patterns, evolution trends, and research gaps.Results: The results show the focus of the studies analyzed regarding the step of policy design and evaluation in the modeling process (46%), besides investigating software development projects (34%). This study also reveals that the most employed tools are simulations (78%) and the causal loop diagram (61%), but only 37% presented model equations. As for the software and information system projects success dimension, system quality has prevailed (73%).Conclusion: The mapping showed that there is a gap of studies exploring the implementation and post implementation phases of software and information systems. Few studies explored the social components; the majority of the studies focused on technical aspects and did not report the complete steps of system dynamics modeling development process. This lack of information hinders the reproduction of past results for expanding and developing new studies. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Commercial hypervisor-based task sandboxing mechanisms are unsecured? But we can fix it!
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyber-Physical-Social Systems are frequently prescribed for providing valuable information on personalized services. The foundation of these services is big data which must be trustily collected and efficiently processed. Though High Performance Computing and Communication technique makes great contributions to addressing the issue of data processing, its effectiveness still relies on the veracity of data generated from Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Nevertheless, IoT devices, as basic production facilities to ensure data's security, are unable to deploy expensive security extensions. Consequently, it causes the implementation of the task sandboxing, the fundamental security mechanism in Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOSs), much simpler and more vulnerable. In this paper, we take ARM Mbed uVisor as an example system, utilizing hypervisor-based task sandboxing mechanisms, and presents three new findings: First, we discover vulnerabilities against Mbed task sandboxing, which can be exploited to compromise system-maintained data structure to manipulate any tasks' data. Second, we present LIPS (Lightweight Intra-Mode Privilege Separation), building a special protection domain to isolate particular system-maintained data structures. Finally, thorough evaluation and experimental tests show the efficiency of LIPS to defeat these attacks, with small runtime overheads and good portability.

AB  - Software aging is a phenomenon, usually caused by resource contention, that can cause mission critical and business critical computer systems to hang, panic, or suffer performance degradation. If the incipience or onset of software aging mechanisms can be reliably defected in advance of performance degradation, corrective actions can be taken to prevent system hangs, or dynamic failover events can be triggered in fault tolerant systems. In the 1990's the U.S. Dept. of Energy and NASA funded development of an advanced statistical pattern recognition method called the Multivariate State Estimation Technique (MSET) for proactive online detection of dynamic sensor and signal anomalies in nuclear power plants and Space Shuttle Main Engine telemetry data. The present investigation was undertaken to investigate,the feasibility and practicability of applying MSET for realtime proactive detection of software aging mechanisms in complex, multi-CPU servers. The procedure uses MSET for model based parameter estimation in conjunction with statistical fault detection and Bayesian fault decision processing. A realtime software telemetry harness was designed to continuously sample over 50 performance metrics related to computer system load, throughput, queue lengths, and transaction latencies. A series of fault injection experiments was conducted using a "memory leak" injector tool with controllable parasitic resource con,sumption rates. MSET was able to reliably detect the onset of resource contention problems with high sensitivity and excellent false-alarm avoidance. Spin-off applications of this NASA-funded innovation for business critical eCommerce servers are described.

AB  - The increasing level of sophistication of cyber attacks which are employing cross-cutting strategies that leverage multi-domain attack surfaces, including but not limited to, software defined networking poisoning, biasing of machine learning models to suppress detection, exploiting software (development), and leveraging system design deficiencies.While current defensive solutions exist, they only partially address multi-domain and multi-stage attacks, thus rendering them ineffective to counter the upcoming generation of attacks. More specifically, we argue that a disruption is needed to approach separated knowledge domains, namely Intrusion Tolerant systems, cybersecurity, and machine learning.We argue that current solutions tend to address different concerns/facets of overlapping issues and they tend to make strong assumptions of supporting infrastructure, e.g., assuming that event probes/metrics are not compromised.To address these issues, we present Skynet, a platform that acts as a secure overseer that merges traditional roles of SIEMs with conventional orchestrators while being rooted on the fundamentals introduced by previous generations of intrusion tolerant systems. Our goal is to provide an open-source intrusion tolerant platform that can dynamically adapt to known and unknown security threats in order to reduce potential vulnerability windows.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 21st ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Formal Methods and Models for System Design (MEMOCODE)
CL  - Hamburg, GERMANY
AB  - Intelligent components such as reinforcement learning are increasingly used in safety-critical embedded systems, e.g., in cars, trains or traffic control systems. While it is crucial to verify the correctness of such systems under all circumstances, their formal verification is difficult due to multiple challenges: the real-time and concurrent behavior, deeply intertwined hardware and software components, the lack of formal semantics in industrially used design languages such as SystemC, and the trial-and-error behavior of learning components. In this paper, we present an approach to safely integrate learning into systems that are designed in SystemC using timed contracts and model checking. Our main contribution is twofold: 1) We show how the safe behavior of a learning component within a concurrent real-time system can be defined by a timed contract. 2) We provide an embedding of such contracts into an existing transformation from SystemC to Uppaal timed automata. This enables us to use the Uppaal model checker to formally verify that the SystemC design is safe under the assumption that the learning component adheres to its timed contract. To ensure safe behavior at runtime, we integrate the contract as a runtime monitor in the SystemC design. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach with a case study of an intelligent traffic light controller that uses reinforcement learning.

TI  - Identifying and fixing ambiguities in, and semantically accurate formalisation of, behavioural requirements
T2  - SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS MODELING
M3  - Article
AB  - To correctly formalise requirements expressed in natural language, ambiguities must first be identified and then fixed. This paper focuses on behavioural requirements (i.e. requirements related to dynamic aspects and phenomena). Its first objective is to show, based on a practical, public case study, that the disambiguation process cannot be fully automated: even though natural language processing (NLP) tools and machine learning might help in the identification of ambiguities, fixing them often requires a deep, application-specific understanding of the reasons of being of the system of interest, of the characteristics of its environment, of which trade-offs between conflicting objectives are acceptable, and of what is achievable and what is not; it may also require arduous negotiations between stakeholders. Such an understanding and consensus-making ability is not in the reach of current tools and technologies, and will likely remain so for a long while. Beyond ambiguity, requirements are often marred by various other types of defects that could lead to wholly unacceptable consequences. In particular, operational experience shows that requirements inadequacy (whereby, in some of the situations the system could face, what is required is woefully inappropriate or what is necessary is left unspecified) is a significant cause for systems failing to meet expectations. The second objective of this paper is to propose a semantically accurate behavioural requirements formalisation format enabling tool-supported requirements verification, notably with simulation. Such support is necessary for the engineering of large and complex cyber-physical and socio-technical systems to ensure, first, that the specified requirements indeed reflect the true intentions of their authors and second, that they are adequate for all the situations the system could face. To that end, the paper presents an overview of the BASAALT (Behaviour Analysis and Simulation All Along systems Life Time) systems engineering method, and of FORM-L (FOrmal Requirements Modelling Language), its supporting language, which aims at representing as accurately and completely as possible the semantics expressed in the original, natural language behavioural requirements, and is markedly different from languages intended for software code generation. The paper shows that generally, semantically accurate formalisation is not a simple paraphrasing of the original natural language requirements: additional elements are often needed to fully and explicitly reflect all that is implied in natural language. To provide such complements for the case study presented in the paper, we had to follow different formalisation patterns, i.e. sequences of formalisation steps. For this paper, to avoid being skewed by what a particular automatic tool can and cannot do, BASAALT and FORM-L were applied manually. Still, the lessons learned could be used to specify and develop NLP tools that could assist the disambiguation and formalisation processes. However, more studies are needed to determine whether an exhaustive set of formalisation patterns can be identified to fully automate the formalisation process.

TI  - Towards reusable building blocks for agent-based modelling and theory development
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the increasing use of standards for documenting and testing agent -based models (ABMs) and sharing of open access code, most ABMs are still developed from scratch. This is not only inefficient, but also leads to ad hoc and often inconsistent implementations of the same theories in computational code and delays progress in the exploration of the functioning of complex social -ecological systems (SES). We argue that reusable building blocks (RBBs) known from professional software development can mitigate these issues. An RBB is a submodel that represents a particular mechanism or process that is relevant across many ABMs in an application domain, such as plant competition in vegetation models, or reinforcement learning in a behavioural model. RBBs need to be distinguished from modules, which represent entire subsystems and include more than one mechanism and process. While linking modules faces the same challenges as integrating different models in general, RBBs are "atomic" enough to be more easily re -used in different contexts. We describe and provide examples from different domains for how and why building blocks are used in software development, and the benefits of doing so for the ABM community and to individual modellers. We propose a template to guide the development and publication of RBBs and provide example RBBs that use this template. Most importantly, we propose and initiate a strategy for community -based development, sharing and use of RBBs. Individual modellers can have a much greater impact in their field with an RBB than with a single paper, while the community will benefit from increased coherence, facilitating the development of theory for both the behaviour of agents and the systems they form. We invite peers to upload and share their RBBs via our website - preferably referenced by a DOI (digital object

CP  - IEEE/AIAA 40th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Estimating Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) is of utmost importance for developing Cyber-Physical and Safety-Critical Systems. The system's scheduler uses the estimated WCET to schedule each task of these systems, and failure may lead to catastrophic events. It is thus imperative to build provably reliable systems. WCET is available to us in the last stage of systems development when the hardware is available and the application code is compiled on it. Different methodologies measure the WCET, but none of them give early insights on WCET, which is crucial for system development. If the system designers overestimate WCET in the early stage, then it would lead to the overqualified system, which will increase the cost of the final product, and if they underestimate WCET in the early-stage, then it would lead to financial loss as the system would not perform as expected.This paper estimates early WCET using Deep Neural Networks as an approximate predictor model for hardware architecture and compiler. This model predicts the WCET based on the source code without compiling and running on the hardware architecture. Our WCET prediction model is created using the Pytorch framework. The resulting WCET is too erroneous to be used as an upper bound on the WCET. However, getting these results in the early stages of system development is an essential prerequisite for the system's dimensioning and configuration of the hardware setup.

AB  - The development and validation studies of new multisensory biomarkers and sensor-triggered interventions requires collecting raw sensor data with associated labels in the natural field environment. Unlike platforms for traditional mHealth apps, a software platform for such studies needs to not only support high-rate data ingestion, but also share raw high-rate sensor data with researchers, while supporting high-rate sense-analyze-act functionality in real-time. We present mCerebrum, a realization of such a platform, which supports high-rate data collections from multiple sensors with real-time assessment of data quality. A scalable storage architecture (with near optimal performance) ensures quick response despite rapidly growing data volume. Micro-batching and efficient sharing of data among multiple source and sink apps allows reuse of computations to enable real-time computation of multiple biomarkers without saturating the CPU or memory. Finally, it has a reconfigurable scheduler which manages all prompts to participants that is burden-and context-aware. With a modular design currently spanning 23+ apps, mCerebrum provides a comprehensive ecosystem of system services and utility apps. The design of mCerebrum has evolved during its concurrent use in scientific field studies at ten sites spanning 106,806 person days. Evaluations show that compared with other platforms, mCerebrum's architecture and design choices support 1.5 times higher data rates and 4.3 times higher storage throughput, while causing 8.4 times lower CPU usage.

AB  - Environmental problems are often complex as they typically deal with several disciplines and affect large regions. Tackling such problems requires integration of computational tools. Solving environmental problems requires cooperation between the groups that develop the tools and the groups that use the tools and transfer of information and technology. The process is becoming more and more complex as the problems we try to solve become larger. We are faced with the task of designing an architecture of an information system (IS) for managing the problem solving process.Attempts to overcome difficulties in solving complex real-world problems, such as environmental problems, include advances in the theory of complex systems, development of information system frameworks, and development of open standards. The theory of dynamic networks gives us tools to understand and possibly design better and more robust and resilient systems (Watts 2003). The idea of an information system framework for environmental modeling is an answer to the general need of linking a model to a database, to another model, to a GIS, or to other tools. In the field of geoinformatics there are several projects that develop open standards, while in the field of environmental modeling there are fewer such projects.In spite of these efforts there is still a need for new approaches, which link and help to link work carried out in different communities. In this paper we discuss the linkages between simulation models, environmental data and end users, and make an attempt to define the design processes of an IS architecture in model-based environmental problem solving. We present key points of the development of a DSS for the CLIME (Climate and Lake Impacts in Europe) project.The general IS development process is often divided into five phases: problem analysis, architectural design, development, implementation, and evaluation. In the analysis phase the problem in question is analyzed and an understanding is developed. In the design phase the architecture of the IS is prepared. The development phase deals with the actual construction of the IS. In the implementation phase the constructed IS is transferred to the work environment in which it will be used. The evaluation is the real-world test of the implemented system. From evaluation the process goes back to analysis.The environmental problem, which the CLIME project studies, is climate change and its effects on lakes and the impacts of the changes in the lakes to the society. Besides the environmental and socioeconomic domains, there are also other domains as the future DSS users and the scientists within the project. The CLIME project has a designated, but heterogeneous, end-user community, which is the primary target user group of the DSS.The architecture of the CLIME DSS is at the highest level a network of four nodes in chain. The offline part of the system produces data, which is stored in a database. The user has access to the information in the database through the online part of the system. The information exchange is two-way in each connection, but, because of the structure, the user does not have a direct access to the database or to the offline system. This architecture is a, very generic, solution to the knowledge transfer problem.Besides providing a platform for causal Bayesian networks, the design of the CLIME DSS includes visualization capabilities. The visualizations are prepared in the offline part of the DSS, stored in the database, and used in the online part.Our conclusion is that the problem analysis and architectural design phases are not given enough thought considering how important they are. One reason for this may be that the methodological tools are not yet fully matured, which is understandable as the fields of problem analysis and software architecture are still rather new and developing. New innovations in the above fields could provide a promising avenue for integrating methods used by modelers, software developers, and decision makers in environmental problem solving.

TI  - Physics-informed information field theory for modeling physical systems with uncertainty quantification
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Data-driven approaches coupled with physical knowledge are powerful techniques to model engineering systems. The goal of such models is to efficiently solve for the under-lying physical field through combining measurements with known physical laws. As many physical systems contain unknown elements, such as missing parameters, noisy measure-ments, or incomplete physical laws, this is widely approached as an uncertainty quantifi-cation problem. The common techniques to handle all of these variables typically depend on the specific numerical scheme used to approximate the posterior, and it is desirable to have a method which is independent of any such discretization. Information field theory (IFT) provides the tools necessary to perform statistics over fields that are not necessar-ily Gaussian. The objective of this paper is to extend IFT to physics-informed information field theory (PIFT) by encoding the functional priors with information about the physical laws which describe the field. The posteriors derived from this PIFT remain independent of any numerical scheme, and can capture multiple modes which allows for the solution of problems which are not well-posed. We demonstrate our approach through an analyti-cal example involving the Klein-Gordon equation. We then develop a variant of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to draw samples from the field posterior and from the poste-rior of any model parameters. We apply our method to several numerical examples with various degrees of model-form error and to inverse problems involving non-linear differ-ential equations. As an addendum, the method is equipped with a metric which allows the posterior to automatically quantify model-form uncertainty. Because of this, our numerical experiments show that the method remains robust to even an incorrect representation of the physics given sufficient data. We numerically demonstrate that the method correctly identifies when the physics cannot be trusted, in which case it automatically treats learn-ing the field as a regression problem.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Advanced security testing using a cyber-attack forecasting model: A case study of financial institutions
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE-EVOLUTION AND PROCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the number of cyber-attacks on financial institutions has increased over the past few years, an advanced system that is capable of predicting the target of an attack is essential. Such a system needs to be integrated into the existing detection systems of financial institutions as it provides them with proactive controls with which to halt an attack by predicting patterns. Advanced prediction systems also enhance the software design and security testing of new advanced cyber-security measures by providing new testing scenarios supported by attack forecasting. This present study developed a model that forecasts future network-based cyber-attacks on financial institutions using a deep neural network. The dataset that was used to train and test the model consisted of some of the biggest cyber-attacks on banking institutions over the past three years. This provided insight into new patterns that may end with a cyber-crime. These new attacks were also evaluated to determine behavioral similarities with the nearest known attack or a combination of several existing attacks. The performance of the forecasting model was then evaluated in a real banking environment and provided a forecasting accuracy of 90.36%. As such, financial institutions can use the proposed forecasting model to improve their security testing measures.

AB  - This project studied the next-generation integrated CAD systems after various computer simulation technologies have become available in ordinary design activities. While simulation technologies are indispensable for design evaluation, design is natively synthetic activities, and it is necessary to integrate simulation technology outcomes and design synthesis activities. Under this circumstance, we researched into object modeling methods, distributed design systems and optimization techniques. The research results are summarized as follows :(a) A configuration centered modeling framework was proposed as a key technology toward the above integration, which has abilities to manage hierarchical design information, to deduct simulation models and so forth. This modeling was also applied to a design problem of an air-conditioner unit, where some components are arranged and several pipes are routed.(b) An agent-based distributed design system architecture was developed for concurrent design processes of large, complicated systems. This architecture can integrate isolated design systems through computer network in accordance with system structure of engineering systems. An experimental design system was implemented for basic ship design for ascertainment of the architecture.(c) A genetic algorithm based design optimization method was developed for large-scale multi-objective design problems of practical engineering systems, physical phenomena of which are too ill-posed to apply ordinary design optimization methods. This method was applied to the preliminary optimal design problem of an automotive engine.(d) Futher, the issues toward integration of design syntheses in conceptual and configuration phases were discussed with a design problem of chain-type mechanism systems as a forthcoming research direction.

TI  - Modeling photosynthetically oxygenated biodegradation processes using artificial neural networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The complexity of the mechanisms underlying organic matter mineralization and nutrient removal in algal-bacterial photobioreactors during the treatment of residual wastewaters has severely hindered the development of mechanistic models able to accurately describe these processes. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are capable of inferring the complex relationships existing between input and output process variables without a detailed description of the mechanisms governing the process, and should therefore be more suitable for the modeling of photosynthetically oxygenated systems. Thus, a neural network consisting of a single hidden layer with four neurons accurately predicted the steady-state operation of a continuous stirred tank photobioreactor during salicylate biodegradation by an algal-bacterial consortium. Despite its simplicity and the low number of data sets for ANN training (23), this network topology exhibited a satisfactory fit for both training and testing data with correlation coefficients of 99%. Although the use of ANNs for modeling conventional wastewater treatment systems is not novel, this work constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the first reported application of ANNs to photosynthetically oxygenated systems and one of the few models for microalgae-based treatment processes. This modeling approach is therefore expected to contribute to improve the understanding of the complex relationships between light, temperature, hydraulic retention time, pollutant concentration and process removal efficiency, which would eventually promote the development of algal-bacterial processes as a cost effective alternative for the treatment of industrial wastewaters.(c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - Cyber-security assurance evaluation seeks to gain evidence that the relevant requirements of an IT system are met. Towards that end, carefully-designed evaluation processes of the considered systems are needed. The only so-far validated approach, the Common Criteria (CC) standard, relies on exhaustive evaluation tasks to provide (up to) the highest possible assurance at the expense of increased costs. When the evaluation involves the connected vehicles paradigm which integrates a mosaic of third-party modules and interfaces, applying CC becomes problematic; the cost in resources and time further increases while relevant automated tools or document templates, are scarce.This paper introduces the AFT (Assurance Framework Toolkit) which is a platform-independent online software toolkit that enables efficient CC-based cyber-security evaluations on products of the automotive cyber-physical ecosystem. A set of relevant CC-specific security assurance needs are explained and the way that the AFT software-design and functionality covers them, is presented. Subsequently, the development of the toolkit (with publicly available source-code) as well as its capability to meet the evaluation of automotive needs, are detailed. Finally, an empirical study estimates the expected AFT gains against typical CC unassisted evaluations. The proposed toolkit (along with its extendibility feature) practically tackles the cost-limitations of standardized security evaluations filling an important technology gap towards safer connected driving.

TI  - Turbulent Flow of Water-Based Optimization Using New Objective Function for Parameter Extraction of Six Photovoltaic Models
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of new energy power systems, the estimation of the parameters of photovoltaic (PV) models has become increasingly important. Weather changes are random; therefore, the changes in the PV output power are periodic and nonlinear. Traditional power prediction methods are based on linearity, and relying only on a time series is not feasible. Consequently, metaheuristic algorithms have received considerable attention to extract the parameters of solar cell models and achieve excellent performance. In this study, the Turbulent Flow of Water-based Optimization (TFWO) is used to estimate the parameters of three traditional solar cell models, namely, Single-Diode Solar Cell Model (SDSCM), Double-Diode Solar Cell Model (DDSCM), and Three-Diode Solar Cell Model (TDSCM), in addition to three modified solar cell models, namely, modified SDSCM (MSDSCM), modified DDSCM (MDDSCM), and modified TDSCM (MTDSCM). Moreover, a polynomial equation of five degrees for the sum of squared errors (PE5DSSE) between the measured and calculated currents was used as a new objective function for extracting the parameters of the solar cell models. The proposed objective function delivered improved prediction accuracy than common objective functions. Experimental results revealed the effectiveness of TFWO compared with six counterparts, namely, "Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (TSA), Grey wolf optimizer (GWO), modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO), Cuckoo Search algorithm (CSA), Moth flame optimizer (MFO) and Teaching Learning based optimization algorithm (TLBO),) for all the traditional and modified solar cell models based on the optimal parameters extracted using best PE5DSSE values.

AB  - Cloud computing offers the opportunity to minimize the evaluation time of complex algorithms - e.g. needed for computational imaging - by horizontal scaling of the available computing resources. By this way, new image analyzing algorithms can be employed in weak real-time conditions, like inline quality analysis in production with time stamps in the order of several tens of seconds. The cloud offers a platform to merge sensor data of all production processes to analyze quality data comprehensively, e.g. for methods like predictive maintenance. Typically, cloud environments are applied for the Internet of things (IoT) or Big Data analysis. But IoT-applications usually generate very small data packages (like sensor values with a size much less than 1 megabyte), while Big Data applications deal with very high data volume (terra- or petabyte). Image processing requires an environment, which is optimized for medium size data streaming, composed of images with a size in the lower megabyte range. In this paper, a sensor to-cloud architecture as a platform for image processing is described. This approach is upward compatible, because it is not necessary to change the sensor hardware, e.g. if algorithms with considerable higher computing complexity are desired (like for a smart camera), so algorithms can be exchanged in the cloud without interrupting the production process.

TI  - Efficient self-organizing multilayer neural network for nonlinear system modeling
T2  - NEURAL NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been shown extensively that the dynamic behaviors of a neural system are strongly influenced by the network architecture and learning process. To establish an artificial neural network (ANN) with self-organizing architecture and suitable learning algorithm for nonlinear system modeling, an automatic axon-neural network (AANN) is investigated in the following respects. First, the network architecture is constructed automatically to change both the number of hidden neurons and topologies of the neural network during the training process. The approach introduced in adaptive connecting-and-pruning algorithm (ACP) is a type of mixed mode operation, which is equivalent to pruning or adding the connecting of the neurons, as well as inserting some required neurons directly. Secondly, the weights are adjusted, using a feedforward computation (FC) to obtain the information for the gradient during learning computation. Unlike most of the previous studies, AANN is able to self-organize the architecture and weights, and to improve the network performances. Also, the proposed AANN has been tested on a number of benchmark problems, ranging from nonlinear function approximating to nonlinear systems modeling. The experimental results show that AANN can have better performances than that of some existing neural networks. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - CAREER: A Programming Language for Developing Software to Execute Reliably on Unreliable Hardware
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - The landscape of software development has changed as computing platforms have reached the end of Moore?s Law. Specifically, the tactic of aggressively shrinking computer processors to yield increased computer performance has been paused as modern processors have -- as a result -- become more vulnerable to errors in their manufacture and operation. As a result, applications executed on many emerging systems need to be specifically designed to execute through faults in the underlying execution platform.  This project provides a new programming language with a supporting compiler and verification system that enables developers to work with a model of the execution platform to deliver provably reliable computations even in the presence of faults in the underlying execution platform. The project's intellectual merit is the development of state-of-the-art techniques for reasoning about program behavior that capture the growing availability of soft-computing fabrics, such as unreliable computer processors, energy-harvesting systems, and cyber-physical systems. Moreover, in a society that is increasingly dependent on computing systems, the project?s broader significance is to provide software developers, engineers, and scientists with new tools to build efficient and powerful systems that fully exploit the benefits of new hardware platforms while simultaneously delivering the reliable, resilient execution that society needs.A key idea behind this project is to extend a language, compiler, and verification system to support programmatic, first-class execution models that capture the semantics of execution platforms that deliver alternative results for a given operation. Such execution models are first-class in that the developer can communicate with the verification system to verify correctness properties of the computation that are related to the explicit state of the execution model itself. A key driver behind the feasibility of this approach is that the project leverages relational verification. Specifically, the system can reason about two separate executions of the program: 1) the idealized reliable execution of the program and 2) the actual, faulty execution as specified by the execution model.  Such reasoning 1) enables a user to specify properties, such as accuracy, that relate values between the two executions and 2) enables the system and user together efficiently verify programs by, for example, demonstrating that a desired property holds of the faulty execution because faults do not interfere with the property's validity. Building upon these key directions, this project also investigates new mechanisms to build reliability-aware optimizing compilers that still soundly transform the program even in the presence of alternative execution models.  Together, the results of this project will enable developers to leverage the wide variety of new computing platforms for which execution models are non-standard, highly configurable, and approximate -- yet still produce an application that has strong guarantees. Moreover, the proposal is to validate the approach by integrating the results into new coursework on programming language design and implementation.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

T2  - INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Nowadays the most effective way to improve the reliability of software is an approach with the introduction of software redundancy - multi-version programming. The reliability of a multi-version system is determined not only by the reliability of the versions that make it up, but to a greater degree by the decision making algorithm.Objective: Our objective is evaluation and selection of the most reliable voting algorithms in multi-version environments. In order to get this objective there is a need to check all the algorithms in the execution environment, simulating characteristic of the developed system. Thus, we obtain the characteristics of the quality of the algorithm operation in precisely those conditions in which it will work in the system that is developed.Method: The article suggests weighted voting algorithms with a forgetting element, as well as modifications of existing voting algorithms. To be able to check the quality of their work, the simulation environment has been implemented that simulates the operation of the software multi-version execution environment.Results: The article substantiates the use of the most reliable decision making algorithms in the decision block of the real-time operating system. A comparative analysis of decision making algorithms for the operation of the decision making block of the multi-version real-time execution environment has been carried out.Conclusions: The software implementation of the simulation environment that implements the simulations of versions with given characteristics is considered, not only classical decision making algorithms, but also the author's modifications are investigated. The environment allows to obtain the quality characteristics of all implemented decision making algorithms with given system characteristics. The modeling results are considered, the dependence of the system reliability indicators on its input parameters is shown, a comparative analysis of various decision making algorithms based on the modeling results is made.

TI  - MSW to synthetic natural gas: System modeling and thermodynamics assessment
T2  - WASTE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To achieve environmental-friendly and energy-efficiency synthetic natural gas (SNG) production routing from municipal solid waste (MSW), a MSW-to-SNG process is unprecedentedly presented in this work, of which the designed configuration is developed and simulated with the aid of Aspen Plus. In addition, sensitivity analyses on major operation parameters, such as equivalence volume ratio (ER), steam-to-MSW mass ratio (S/M) and methanation pressure, are performed with the discussion of process efficiencies and SNG quality. In parallel, the comparison analysis is considered by adopting various MSW material. In this work, the composition of SNG mainly consists of 87.7% CH4, 2.9% CO2, 2.3% H-2 and 7.1% N-2. And lower heating value (LHV) together with Wobbe index of SNG are separately 31.66 MJ/Nm(3) and 45.90 MJ/Nm(3). Moreover, the wood-to-SNG, MSW-to-SNG and coal-to-SNG processes are carried out to demonstrate the superiority of the MSW-to-SNG process. The results reveal that the MSW-to-SNG process is a promising option to dispose MSW environmentally, meanwhile converting MSW to the valuable SNG. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduce a novel on-line biomonitoring system based on a valvometric conversion technique for clam Corbicula fluminea, allowing for rapid, continuous, and ecological relevant water quality control. Our model builds upon the basic principles of biological early warning system model in two ways. We first adopted a risk-based methodology to build a dynamic artificial clam for simulating how the bivalve closure rhythm in response to waterborne copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd). Secondly, we integrated a probabilistic model associated with the time-varying dose-response relationships of valve closing behavior into the mechanisms of a dynamic artificial clam, allowing estimation of the time-varying waterborne Cu/Cd concentrations for on-line providing the outcomes of the toxicity detection technique. Measurements with Cu/Cd were performed and the calculated EC50 values were compared with published data for the valve movement test with C. fluminea. This proposed dynamic artificial clam provides a better quantitative understanding of on-line biomonitoring measurements of waterborne metals and may foster applications in clam farm management strategy and ecotoxicological risk assessment.

TI  - Safety integrity through self-adaptation for multi-sensor event detection: Methodology and case-study
T2  - FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional safety-critical systems are engineered in a way to be predictable in all operating conditions. They are common in industrial automation and transport applications where uncertainties (e.g., fault occurrence rates) can be modeled and precisely evaluated. Furthermore, they use high-cost hardware components to increase system reliability. On the contrary, future systems are increasingly required to be "smart"(or "intelligent") that is to adapt to new scenarios, learn and react to unknown situations, possibly using low-cost hardware components. In order to move a step forward to fulfilling those new expectations, in this paper we address run-time stochastic evaluation of quantitative safety targets, like hazard rate, in self-adaptive event detection systems by using Bayesian Networks and their extensions. Self-adaptation allows changing correlation schemes on diverse detectors based on their reputation, which is continuously updated to account for performance degradation as well as modifications in environmental conditions. To that aim, we introduce a specific methodology and show its application to a case-study of vehicle detection with multiple sensors for which a real-world data-set is available from a previous study. Besides providing a proof-of-concept of our approach, the results of this paper pave the way to the introduction of new paradigms in the dynamic safety assessment of smart systems.

AB  - From air pollution monitoring to debatable surveillance for better security, dynamic distributed systems led to the birth of versatile smart environments. Dependability of such systems is challenged by the reliability of the communication links between various sub-systems. In this paper, we address this issue by designing a TCP/IP based Client-Server architecture using diverse channels, to ensure zero tolerance with regards to outage of service. The prototype system uses Raspberry Pi 3, as a remote client, to intelligently communicate with the server node by choosing one or a set of available communication links, e.g., Ethernet (LAN), Wireless-LAN (Wi-Fi), and Bluetooth channels. We further implement the system using Open Services Gateway Initiative (OSGi), a modular and interpolate-able code foundation, to withstand the challenges faced by the modern software industry e.g. complexity and scalability. Prototype system was successfully tested for hardware and software fault tolerance using different test scenarios to ensure uninterrupted service delivery. In the end, we also present a machine learning technique to mitigate the effects of severe channel hostilities for diverse channels system. The results show improvement in the quality of data transmission by exploiting the flexibility of alternate channels. We demonstrate this intelligent and seamless communication link switching technique using Support Vector Machine (SVM) in MATLAB.

AB  - Software Process Model (SPM) is an abstraction of the software development process over time to assist in managing the process. SPM has attracted significant attention from researchers and practitioners in the past decades. Due to the complexity of SPM, building a practical process model often requires collaboration between academia and industry. Unfortunately, there are few empirical studies on SPM conducted in collaboration with enterprises. In this paper, we report on the challenges and solutions encountered while modeling software processes based on our collaboration with a global enterprise. These experiences are valuable to both researchers and practitioners. We presented the modeling process in detail and collected all the interview records during collaboration. As a result of building an SPM in the enterprise, we identify seven challenges and discussed solutions for each of them. The fundamental issue with SPM remains the quality and availability of data, even within industry settings. To enhance the value and applicability of models, we propose a checklist for building simulation models. The checklist can be used by modelers and practitioners to verify details that are easily overlooked during the modeling process. Our experience report provides a practical reference with researchers and practitioners who are interested in modeling software process.

TI  - scenoRITA : Generating Diverse, Fully Mutable, Test Scenarios for Autonomous Vehicle Planning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) leverage advanced sensing and networking technologies (e.g., camera, LiDAR, RADAR, GPS, DSRC, 5G, etc.) to enable safe and efficient driving without human drivers. Although still in its infancy, AV technology is becoming increasingly common and could radically transform our transportation system and by extension, our economy and society. As a result, there is tremendous global enthusiasm for research, development, and deployment of AVs, e.g., self-driving taxis and trucks from Waymo and Baidu. The current practice for testing AVs uses virtual tests-where AVs are tested in software simulations-since they offer a more efficient and safer alternative compared to field operational tests. Specifically, search-based approaches are used to find particularly critical situations. These approaches provide an opportunity to automatically generate tests; however, systematically creating valid and effective tests for AV software remains a major challenge. To address this challenge, we introduce scenoRITA, a test generation approach for AVs that uses an evolutionary algorithm with (1) a novel gene representation that allows obstacles to be fully mutable, hence, resulting in more reported violations and more diverse scenarios, (2) 5 test oracles to determine both safety and motion sickness-inducing violations and (3) a novel technique to identify and eliminate duplicate tests. Our extensive evaluation shows that scenoRITA can produce test scenarios that are more effective in revealing ADS bugs and more diverse in covering different parts of the map compared to other state-of-the-art test generation approaches.

TI  - The role of program analysis in security vulnerability detection: Then and now
T2  - COMPUTERS & SECURITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Program analysis techniques play an important role in detecting security vulnerabilities. In this paper we describe our experiences in developing a variety of tools that detect security vulnerabilities in an industrial setting. The main driving forces for adoption of program analysis tools by a development organisation are low false positive rate, ease of integration in the developer's workflow, scalability to handle industrial size systems and results that are easy to understand. Even if one the above dimensions is not supported, the tool will not be used in practice. We show how the analyses of program analysis tools have changed over more than a decade due to differences in languages, e.g., code written in systems-level languages like C tend to focus on memory-related vulnerabilities, in contrast to languages like Java, JavaScript and Python where the focus is more on injection vulnerabilities in web or cloud applications. Based on language, static or dynamic analysis approaches are needed, including hybrid approaches. We conclude with our vision on Intelligent Application Security - how program analysis tools will keep changing to enable the DevSecOps model given the fertile ground that the DevOps model provides today. We foresee different program analysis tools working together by sharing information, including the results they produce, while addressing newer security issues such as those related to supply chain issues. In this way, program analysis tools would be extended with relevant machine learning techniques and be integrated in all different phases of the code development, building, testing, deployment and monitoring cycle.

TI  - Microservices and serverless functions-lifecycle, performance, and resource utilisation of edge based real-time IoT analytics
T2  - FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Edge Computing harnesses resources close to the data sources to reduce end -to -end latency and allow realtime process automation for verticals such as Smart City, Healthcare and Industry 4.0. Edge resources are limited when compared to traditional Cloud data centres; hence the choice of proper resource management strategies in this context becomes paramount. Microservice and Function as a Service architectures support modular and agile patterns, compared to a monolithic design, through lightweight containerisation, continuous integration/ deployment and scaling. The advantages brought about by these technologies may initially seem obvious, but we argue that their usage at the Edge deserves a more in-depth evaluation. By analysing both the software development and deployment lifecycle, along with performance and resource utilisation, this paper explores microservices and two alternative types of serverless functions to build edge real-time IoT analytics. In the experiments comparing these technologies, microservices generally exhibit slightly better end -to -end processing latency and resource utilisation than serverless functions. One of the serverless functions and the microservices excel at handling larger data streams with auto -scaling. Whilst serverless functions natively offer this feature, the choice of container orchestration framework may determine its availability for microservices. The other serverless function, while supporting a simpler lifecycle, is more suitable for low -invocation scenarios and faces challenges with parallel requests and inherent overhead, making it less suitable for real-time processing in demanding IoT settings.

TI  - Hybrid quantum architecture for smart city security
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently and in the near future, Smart Cities are vital to enhance urban living, address resource challenges, optimize infrastructure, and harness technology for sustainability, efficiency, and improved quality of life in rapidly urbanizing environments. Owing to the high usage of networks, sensors, and connected devices, Smart Cities generate a massive amount of data. Therefore, Smart City security concerns encompass data privacy, Internet-of-Things (IoT) vulnerabilities, cyber threats, and urban infrastructure risks, requiring robust solutions to safeguard digital assets, citizens, and critical services. Some solutions include robust cybersecurity measures, data encryption, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven threat detection, public-private partnerships, standardized security protocols, and community engagement to foster a resilient and secure smart city ecosystem. For example, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) helps in real-time monitoring, threat detection, and incident response by aggregating and analyzing security data. To this end, no integrated systems are operating in this context. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Architecture for bolstering Smart City security that exploits Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and SIEM to provide security based on Quantum Artificial Intelligence and patterns/rules. The validity of the hybrid quantum-classical architecture was proven by conducting experiments and a comparison of the QML algorithms with state-of-the-art AI algorithms. We also provide a proof of concept dashboard for the proposed architecture.

TI  - Linguistic descriptions of thermal comfort data for buildings: Definition, implementation and evaluation
T2  - BUILDING SIMULATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Building Simulation Software tools support designers to analyse and identify certain users' behavioural patterns; besides, they can predict future trends about the energy demand and consumption in buildings, as well as CO2 emissions, design analysis, energy efficiency, or lighting. These tools allow to collect and report information about such processes. However, understanding the results from simulations usually implies interpreting an extremely large amount of data or graphs, which can be a complex task. Therefore, there is a need of alternatives that ease this interpretation of results, hence complementing classic simulation tools. Under the widespread EN 15251 model criteria, this paper presents a novel technology to improve reporting tools of building simulation software by using linguistic description of data and timespan computational perceptions. A data-driven software architecture for automatically generating linguistic reports is here proposed, which provides designers with a better understanding of the data from building simulation tools. In order to show and explore the possibilities of this technology, a software application has been designed, implemented and evaluated by experts. The survey showed that usefulness and clarification were better evaluated than simplicity and time-saving for the three kinds of report, though always above 7 points out of 10, being most of p-values of contingency below 0.05.

TI  - Renewable energy-powered semi-closed greenhouse for sustainable crop production using model predictive control and machine learning for energy management
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Renewable energy consumption in agriculture is ascending, catering to the food needs of the rising population and protecting the environment. Maximizing renewable energy usage efficiency is essential for achieving sustainable development goals. In this work, a nonlinear integrated controlled environment agriculture model is constructed to correlate the impact of weather disturbances, temperature control actuators, humidity control actuators, fertilization, and irrigation to the states of crop production facilities and crop growing conditions. Linearization of the model is performed to reduce the computation time while retaining the accuracy of the nonlinear model. A robust model predictive control framework is developed to maximize renewable energy power usage efficiency and maintain a hospitable sustainable cultivation environment. To improve the robustness of control to hedge against the forecast uncertainties, the disjunctive data-driven uncertainty sets built upon the historical forecast errors are constructed by using machine learning methods, including principal component analysis and kernel density estimation. This work also presents the result of the simulation of controlling a renewable energy-powered semi-closed greenhouse growing tomatoes located in Ithaca, New York. Compared to other model predictive control frameworks, which do not leverage the machine learning approaches, the proposed control framework enables a 0.7%-66.9% reduction in renewable energy usage and a 0.7 wt% to 16.1 wt% increase in crop production. Further analysis of this work reveals that the integrated controlled environment agriculture model can help in increasing renewable energy usage efficiency from 4.7% to 127.5%.

TI  - A Practical Evaluation of Commercial Industrial Augmented Reality Systems in an Industry 4.0 Shipyard
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The principles of the Industry 4.0 are guiding manufacturing companies toward more automated and computerized factories. Such principles are also applied in shipbuilding, which usually involves numerous complex processes whose automation will improve its efficiency and performance. Navantia, a company that has been building ships for 300 years, is modernizing its shipyards according to the Industry 4.0 principles with the help of the latest technologies. Augmented reality (AR), which when utilized in an industrial environment is called industrial AR (IAR), is one of such technologies, since it can be applied in numerous situations in order to provide useful and attractive interfaces that allow shipyard operators to obtain information on their tasks and to interact with certain elements that surround them. This article first reviews the state of the art on IAR applications for shipbuilding and smart manufacturing. Then, the most relevant IAR hardware and software tools are detailed, as well as the main use cases for the application of IAR in a shipyard. Next, it is described Navantia's IAR system, which is based on a fog-computing architecture. Such a system is evaluated when making the use of three IAR devices (a smartphone, a tablet, and a pair of smart glasses), two AR software development kits (ARToolKit and Vuforia) and multiple IAR markers, with the objective of determining their performance in a shipyard workshop and inside a ship under construction. The results obtained show a remarkable performance differences among the different IAR tools and the impact of factors like lighting, pointing out the best combinations of markers, and hardware and software to be used depending on the characteristics of the shipyard scenario.

TI  - Computational nature of human adaptive control during learning of reaching movements in force fields
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Learning to make reaching movements in force fields was used as a paradigm to explore the system architecture of the biological adaptive controller. We compared the performance of a number of candidate control systems that acted on a model of the neuromuscular system of the human arm and asked how well the dynamics of the candidate system compared with the movement characteristics of 16 subjects. We found that control via a supra-spinal system that utilized an adaptive inverse model resulted in dynamics that were similar to that observed in our subjects, but lacked essential characteristics. These characteristics pointed to a different architecture where descending commands were influenced by an adaptive forward model. However, we found that control via a forward model alone also resulted in dynamics that did not match the behavior of the human arm. We considered a third control architecture where a forward model was used in conjunction with an inverse model and found that the resulting dynamics were remarkably similar to that observed in the experimental data. The essential property of this control architecture was that it predicted a complex pattern of near-discontinuities in hand trajectory in the novel force field. A nearly identical pattern was observed in our subjects, suggesting that generation of descending motor commands was likely through a control system architecture that included both adaptive forward and inverse models. We found that as subjects learned to make reaching movements, adaptation rates for the forward and inverse models could be independently estimated and the resulting changes in performance of subjects from movement to movement could be accurately accounted for. Results suggested that the adaptation of the forward model played a dominant role in the motor learning of subjects. After a period of consolidation, the rates of adaptation in the internal models were significantly larger than those observed before the memory had consolidated. This suggested that consolidation of motor memory coincided with freeing of certain computational resources for subsequent learning.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes the use of a class of feedforward artificial neural networks with polynomial activation functions (distinct for each hidden unit) for practical modeling of high-order Volterra systems, Discrete-time Volterra models (DVM's) are often used in the study of nonlinear physical and physiological systems using stimulus-response data, However, their practical use has been hindered by computational limitations that confine them to low-order nonlinearities (i.e., only estimation of low-order kernels is practically feasible), Since three-layer perceptrons (TLP's) can be used to represent input-output nonlinear mappings of arbitrary order, this paper explores the basic relations between DVM and TLP with tapped-delay inputs in the context of nonlinear system modeling, A variant of TLP with polynomial activation functions-termed ''separable Volterra networks'' (SVN's)-is found particularly useful in deriving explicit relations with DVM and in obtaining practicable models of highly nonlinear systems from stimulus-response data, The conditions under which the two approaches yield equivalent representations of the input-output relation are explored, and the feasibility of DVM estimation via equivalent SVN training using backpropagation is demonstrated by computer-simulated examples and compared with results from the Laguerre expansion technique (LET), The use of SVN models allows practicable modeling of high-order nonlinear systems, thus removing the main practical limitation of the DVM approach.

TI  - The underlying potential of NLP for microcontroller programming education
T2  - COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The trend for an increasingly ubiquitous and cyber-physical world has been leveraging the use and importance of microcontrollers (mu C) to unprecedented levels. Therefore, microcontroller programming (mu CP) becomes a paramount skill for electrical and computer engineering students. However, mu CP poses significant challenges for undergraduate students, given the need to master low-level programming languages and several algorithmic strategies that are not usual in "generic" programming. Moreover, mu CP can be time-consuming and complex even when using high-level languages. This article samples the current state of mu CP education in Portugal and unveils the potential support of natural language processing (NLP) tools (such as chatGPT). Our analysis of mu CP curricular units from seven representative Portuguese engineering schools highlights a predominant use of AVR 8-bit mu C and project-based learning. While NLP tools emerge as strong candidates as students' mu C companion, their application and impact on the learning process and outcomes deserve to be understood. This study compares the most prominent NLP tools, analyzing their benefits and drawbacks for mu CP education, building on both hands-on tests and literature reviews. By providing automatic code generation and explanation of concepts, NLP tools can assist students in their learning process, allowing them to focus on software design and real-world tasks that the mu C is designed to handle, rather than on low-level coding. We also analyzed the specific impact of chatGTP in the context of a mu CP course at ISEP, confirming most of our expectations, but with a few curiosities. Overall, this work establishes the foundations for future research on the effective integration of NLP tools in mu CP courses.

TI  - An architecture for mission coordination of heterogeneous robots?
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Robots can potentially collaborate to execute a variety of tasks in the service robots domain. However, developing applications of service robots can be complex due to the high level of uncertainty and required level of autonomy.Objective: We aim at contributing an architecture for the development of applications, capable of coordinating multi-robot missions, and that promotes modifiability and seamless integration of independently developed components.Method: In this work, we introduce MissionControl: an ensemble-based architecture to coordinate missions of heterogeneous robots to autonomously form coalitions. MissionControl comprises a component model and a runtime environment. The component model specifies how the system can be extended for different robot's behaviors and environments. The runtime environment provides the processes required for coordinating the execution of missions at runtime.Results: We evaluated MissionControl in a simulated environment in the healthcare domain. We randomly generated 81 scenarios with uncertainty in the robots' initial configurations. Then, each scenario was executed 8 times (i.e. 648 runs), where we evaluated the feasibility and efficiency of MissionControl for autonomously forming coalitions against a baseline approach that uses a random robot allocation. Statistical hypotheses testing yielded that MissionControl was able to achieve higher success rates while reducing the required time to conclude a mission, when compared to a baseline approach. We also perform an evaluation of the key quality attributes of the architecture, i.e. modifiability and integrability.Conclusions: MissionControl demonstrated itself able to coordinate multi-robot missions by autonomously assigning missions. Despite the error-prone robotic mission environment and demanding computational resources, MissionControl led to a significant increase in the success rate, while also decreasing the time required to conclude robotic missions when compared to a baseline approach.

TI  - Novel design of weighted differential evolution for parameter estimation of Hammerstein-Wiener systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Knacks of evolutionary computing paradigm-based heuristics has been exploited exhaus-tively for system modeling and parameter estimation of complex nonlinear systems due to their legacy of reliable convergence, accurate performance, simple conceptual design ease implementation ease and wider applicability. Objectives: The aim of the presented study is to investigate in evolutionary heuristics of weighted differ-ential evolution (WDE) to estimate the parameters of Hammerstein-Wiener model (HWM) along with comparative evaluation from state-of-the-art counterparts. The objective function of the HWM for con-trolled autoregressive systems is efficaciously formulated by approximating error in mean square sense by computing difference between true and estimated parameters.Methods: The adjustable parameters of HWM are estimated through heuristics of WDE and genetic algo-rithms (GAs) for different degrees of freedom and noise levels for exhaustive, comprehensive, and robust analysis on multiple autonomous trials.Results: Comparison through sufficient large number of graphical and numerical illustrations of outcomes for single and multiple execution of WDE and GAs through different performance measuring metrics of precision, convergence and complexity proves the worth and value of the designed WDE algorithm. Statistical assessment studies further prove the efficacy of the proposed scheme. Conclusion: Extensive simulation based experimentations on measure of central tendency and variance authenticate the effectiveness of the designed methodology WDE as precise, efficient, stable, and robust computing platform for system identification of HWM for controlled autoregressive scenarios.(c) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Noisy recurrent neural networks: The continuous-time case
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - The classical stochastic analog of the deterministic linear system in engineering is the linear system driven by white noise. This model is the basis of many important engineering methodologies in stochastic control, system identification, and signal estimation, and classification. As the promise of artificial neural networks in modeling nonlinear systems continues to grow, the need for a stochastic analog with quantitative foundations for analysis and synthesis will increase. This paper (along with a companion paper) represent recent work in this direction, examining recurrent neural networks: (RNN's) driven by white noise. In this paper, we examine the effect of noise on the typical continuous-time RNN model, First, we perform qualitative analysis establishing uniform boundedness of moments of the neuron states over time. To enable practical application in RNN design and evaluation, however, it is necessary to relate these properties to useful measures that can be estimated. We thus subsequently derive bias and variance measures for the noisy RNN with respect to the corresponding deterministic RNN, This has significant practical implications, since neural-network design is nonminimal in the sense that several different networks can be constructed to solve the same problem. The results in this paper allow the user to quantitatively evaluate given RNN's for noise performance, In addition, the designer call use these results to constrain the design space so that the achieved design satisfies performance specifications whenever possible. An example is provided using the measures derived in this paper to predetermine the best among several RNN designs for a given problem. The companion paper presents results for the discrete-time (so-called time-lagged recurrent) case.

M3  - Article
AB  - We have implemented a Monte Carlo simulator (W(3)MCSim) as an Internet software toot, primarily for interactive use by students, educators, life and other physical scientists, as well as other practitioners of probabilistic and statistical modeling. Interested users download, install and run W(3)MCSim by visiting the application website. This application incorporates three freely available Microsoft((R)) web technologies, namely the Internet Explorer((R)) web browser, the Component Object Model(TM) software framework and the JScript((R)) web page script interpreter. We define the software architecture here, as a web application model, and show how incorporation of these technologies provides an efficient solution to W(3)MCSim software deployment. We demonstrate the usability and versatility of this simulator with three distinct tutorial examples: simulating the sum of six-sided dice, estimating intersection frequency in "Buffon's needle problem", and testing an animal experiment design model a priori. We also show how the program components can be reconfigured into other programs. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Constructing Compact Causal Mathematical Models for Complex Dynamics
T2  - 2017 ACM/IEEE 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (ICCPS)
M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - Pittsburgh, PA
AB  - From microbial communities, human physiology to social and biological/neural networks, complex interdependent systems display multi-scale spatio-temporal patterns that are frequently classified as non-linear, non-Gaussian, non-ergodic, and/or fractal. Distinguishing between the sources of nonlinearity, identifying the nature of fractality (space versus time) and encapsulating the non-Gaussian characteristics into dynamic causal models remains a major challenge for studying complex systems. In this paper, we propose a new mathematical strategy for constructing compact yet accurate models of complex systems dynamics that aim to scrutinize the causal effects and influences by analyzing the statistics of the magnitude increments and the inter-event times of stochastic processes. We derive a framework that enables to incorporate knowledge about the causal dynamics of the magnitude increments and the inter-event times of stochastic processes into a multi-fractional order nonlinear partial differential equation for the probability to find the system in a specific state at one time. Rather than following the current trends in nonlinear system modeling which postulate specific mathematical expressions, this mathematical framework enables us to connect the microscopic dependencies between the magnitude increments and the inter-event times of one stochastic process to other processes and justify the degree of nonlinearity. In addition, the newly presented formalism allows to investigate appropriateness of using multi-fractional order dynamical models for various complex system which was overlooked in the literature. We run extensive experiments on several sets of physiological processes and demonstrate that the derived mathematical models offer superior accuracy over state of the art techniques.

TI  - Systematic application of traffic-signal-control system architecture design and selection using model-based systems engineering and Pareto frontier analysis
T2  - SYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The global population rise has increased vehicles on roads, complicating traffic management. Inefficient traffic control systems cause significant economic losses owing to commuter time wastage, high energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) are vital in traffic management, impacting traffic flow significantly; therefore, studies are exploring new optimization approaches that adapt to changing traffic conditions. However, they concentrate on either new technology infusion or on control algorithm optimization, and do not holistically address the architectural configuration of the system. In this study, we presented a unique case study by applying an existing systematic framework to the TSCS system architecture design and selection process. This application demonstrates that TSCS enhancement is a multifaceted process that requires a comprehensive assessment of not only technical aspects, such as the control algorithm, but also factors including system architecture, security, and data integrity. Because of the increasing reliance of TSCSs on data exchange between their various subsystems, this case study also adopted a cybersecurity perspective of the system and introduced cyber resiliency as a crucial metric for evaluating TSCS architecture performance. Furthermore, through the applied framework, an optimal TSCS architectural configuration with executable options was identified by generating multiple TSCS architectural configurations using decision option patterns and identifying those on the Pareto frontier to understand the architectural decision-making process. Traffic engineers and transportation planners can use this case study application as a guide to optimize TSCSs employed in existing transportation networks and design more efficient transportation networks for future urban development.

TI  - Evaluation of basin-scale hydrologic response to a multi-storm simulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how hydrologic systems of large river basins respond to atmospheric forcing is crucial to regional climate and hydrology studies. A hydrologic model system (HMS) was linked to a regional climate model (RCM) to model a series of storm events passing over the Susquehanna River Basin and to simulate various hydrologic processes in soil hydrology. land surface hydrology, and ground-water hydrology using observed and modeled storm events. The RCM is designed to link to general circulation models and to provide fine spatiotemporal output for hydrologic and other applications. The hydrologic models were calibrated to the observed data (e.g. soil moisture and streamflow) at the basin and subbasin-scales, The HMS-simulated hydrologic response to observed precipitation from a six-storm sequence compares well to the observed. The subgrid-scale spatial variability in precipitation and hydraulic conductivity is included in HMS simulations with RCM-modeled precipitation. Nested 108-36-12 km RCM domains are used for the multi-storm simulation. The 12 km RCM-modeled precipitation is then downscaled to a 1 km hydrologic grid resolution for HMS simulation. Simulations of the six-storm sequence by the RCM produce precipitation fields that appear realistic in general, but that diverge in detail from observed precipitation in both time and space. HMS proves to be sensitive to these details, so the simulated streamflow does not accurately reproduce observed streamflow. The results suggest potential value in improving on the current versions of RCM and HMS for regional climate and hydrology system modeling. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A knowledge-based tool for designing cyber physical production systems
T2  - COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changing production systems and product requirements can trace their origin in volatile customer behaviour and evolving product requirements. This dynamic nature of customer requirements has been described as a constantly moving target, thus presenting a significant challenge for several aspects of product development. To deal with this constant and sometimes unpredictable product evolution, cyber physical production systems (CPPS) that employ condition monitoring, self-awareness and reconfigurability principles, have to be designed and implemented. This research contributes a CPPS design approach that proactively provides the required CPPS design knowledge. This approach aims to minimise or avoids future consequences and disruptions on the CPPS. This knowledge needs to be provided at the right time whilst not being intrusive to the production system designer's cognitive activity. To effectively deal with the complexity of the cyber physical production system design activity with a manual method would lead to a time consuming, and complex support tool which is hard to implement, and difficult to use. The CPPS design approach has therefore been implemented in a prototype digital factory tool. This paper describes in detail the system requirements and system architecture for this tool. In order to establish the effectiveness of the proposed approach for designing cyber physical production systems, the prototype digital factory tool has been evaluated with a case study and a number of semi-structured interviews with both industrial and scientific stakeholders. The encouraging results obtained from this research evaluation have shown that such an approach for supporting the CPPS design activity makes stakeholders aware of their decision consequences and is useful in practice. This result can lead the way for the development and integration of such knowledge-based decision-making approaches within state-of-the-art digital factory and Computer Aided Engineering Design (CAED) tools.

TI  - On three intelligent systems: dynamic neural, fuzzy, and wavelet networks for training trajectory
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Intelligent systems cover a wide range of technologies related to hard sciences, such as modeling and control theory, and soft sciences, such as the artificial intelligence (AI). Intelligent systems, including neural networks (NNs), fuzzy logic (FL), and wavelet techniques, utilize the concepts of biological systems and human cognitive capabilities. These three systems have been recognized as a robust and attractive alternative to the some of the classical modeling and control methods. The application of classical NNs, FL, and wavelet technology to dynamic system modeling and control has been constrained by the non-dynamic nature of their popular architectures. The major drawbacks of these architectures are the curse of dimensionality, such as the requirement of too many parameters in NNs, the use of large rule bases in FL, the large number of wavelets, and the long training times, etc. These problems can be overcome with dynamic network structures, referred to as dynamic neural networks (DNNs), dynamic fuzzy networks (DFNs), and dynamic wavelet networks (DWNs), which have unconstrained connectivity and dynamic neural, fuzzy, and wavelet processing units, called "neurons", "feurons", and "wavelons", respectively. The structure of dynamic networks are based on Hopfield networks. Here, we present a comparative study of DNNs, DFNs, and DWNs for non-linear dynamical system modeling. All three dynamic networks have a lag dynamic, an activation function, and interconnection weights. The network weights are adjusted using fast training (optimization) algorithms (quasi-Newton methods). Also, it has been shown that all dynamic networks can be effectively used in non-linear system modeling, and that DWNs result in the best capacity. But all networks have non-linearity properties in non-linear systems. In this study, all dynamic networks are considered as a non-linear optimization with dynamic equality constraints for non-linear system modeling. They encapsulate and generalize the target trajectories. The adjoint theory, whose computational complexity is significantly less than the direct method, has been used in the training of the networks. The updating of weights (identification of network parameters) is based on Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method. First, phase portrait examples are given. From this, it has been shown that they have oscillatory and chaotic properties. A dynamical system with discrete events is modeled using the above network structure. There is a localization property at discrete event instants for time and frequency in this example.

TI  - A scalable modified deep reinforcement learning algorithm for serverless IoT microservice composition infrastructure in fog layer
T2  - FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays many modern and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled Internet of Things (IoT) applications consist of chains connecting microservices distributed across the fog and cloud layers to achieve a certain functionality. These microservices should be assigned to the available processing instances placed on the things, fog and cloud layers while considering the resource utilization, Quality of Service (QoS) parameters and requirements of the user. Despite several existing optimization approaches, IoT microservice composition remains a challenge in serverless computing architecture due to the large-scale environment, its dynamic nature and the heterogeneous nodes with limited capacity. To address these challenges, a novel IoT microservice composition based on serverless architecture is proposed in the fog layer. Serverless computing is a new paradigm which offers the ability to build scalable applications without worrying about back-end management making this paradigm particularly effective in IoT environment. We specifically propose a modified Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based Microservice Chaining at Fog Layer (DRLMCF) algorithm to improve the distributed chained microservice placement in order to minimize resource utilization and delay in a fog based serverless architecture. Unlike existing methods, the proposed DRLMCF is built on realistic assumptions and does not require expert tuning or a large amount of labeled data to make optimal decisions. Furthermore, our method is not entirely dependent on a central controller and fog nodes take part in the decision making thus making the algorithm scalable in IoT environment. Compared to state-of-the art methods including load balance, shortest path and random schedule algorithms, evaluation by simulating several real-world scenarios demonstrates the proposed DRLMCF improves end to end delay up to 57.3% and the number of successfully chained microservices by up to 84%.

TI  - A Data Mining/ANFIS and Adaptive Control for Detection and Mitigation of Attacks on DC MGs
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID
M3  - Article
AB  - The integration of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has provided modern smart grids, such as direct current (DC) microgrids (MGs), with various advantages, e.g., the possibility of large-scale integration of renewable energy sources and complex control schemes. This extensive deployment of ICTs, however, makes DC MGs prone to a variety of cyber threats, e.g., false data injection (FDI) attacks. On this basis, this paper develops online detection and mitigation schemes to counter FDI attacks against DC MGs. Initially, in the offline training of the detection scheme, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) method is used for extracting prescriptive features of DC MG measurements and clustering them in healthy and under-attack operations under several uncertainties in DC MG operations. These features are used to train an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) architecture for the online identification of FDI attacks. Afterward, the trained ANFIS is used to detect FDI attacks and obtain the attack vectors benefiting from the real-time measurements estimated by an optimal state observer. Finally, an adaptive model predictive controller (AMPC) is developed to update the power-sharing commands-and mitigate the FDI attack-using the ANFIS's obtained attack vectors. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is evaluated for several realistic FDI attack scenarios and different uncertainties. To show the scalability of the proposed detection and mitigation methods, a DC MG with eight converters is also studied in the presence of FDI attacks and uncertainties using real-time simulations.

TI  - Advancing streamflow prediction in data-scarce regions through vegetation-constrained distributed hybrid ecohydrological models
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hybrid models that combine deep learning with physical principles have recently shown significant promise in improving streamflow prediction in data-scarce regions, achieving generally greater accuracy and reliability than either method alone. However, existing hybrid hydrological models underutilize the extensive and readily available remote sensing data on vegetation, which plays a critical role in hydrological processes. Incorporating vegetation information can better constrain model processes by accounting for the interactions and feedbacks between vegetation and hydrology, thereby enabling more robust predictions. In this context, we present a novel distributed hybrid ecohydrological model that integrates dynamic vegetation processes into a distributed hybrid hydrological model, capable of simultaneously simulating leaf area index (LAI) and streamflow through multitask learning. Our results indicate that in scenarios with limited available streamflow data, the combined constraint of LAI spatiotemporal patterns and streamflow significantly enhances the model's ability to generalize streamflow simulation across space and time compared to models trained solely with either LAI or streamflow. Even with the increased availability of streamflow data, models utilizing both LAI and streamflow continue to exhibit superior robustness in streamflow prediction. The distributed ecohydrological model, which employs multi-process coupling and multi-source data constraints, accurately simulates the target variables (i.e., streamflow and LAI) while reliably capturing dynamic changes in other ecohydrological processes, such as evapotranspiration. This capability highlights its potential for multi-process diagnostics. Overall, our approach offers a new perspective for streamflow prediction in data-scarce regions and represents an important step towards integrating observational constraints from multiple subsystems into hybrid Earth system modeling.

TI  - An Integrated Assessment of Urban Energy Systems involving Distributed Optimization and Multi-agent Model
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - This research proposes a system modeling for the assessment of urban energy systems. Recently, urban energy systems on the commercial and residential building sector have changed rapidly since the consumers can simultaneously play suppliers based on cogeneration systems. The progress in the COP of heat pumps and other energy equipments have also complicated the situation. Our research aims at the development of new models towards the optimal planning of urban energy systems involving the behavior of multiple subjects and the properties of the equipment. This research project consists of two sub-categories; the first one is the model development based on multi-agent simulation model and the second one reflects the detailed properties of energy equipments such as partial load properties of gas engines and temperature dependencies of heat pumps.In the multi-agent model, power generation utility, independent power producer and consumers with/without cogeneration systems are considered. These agents sell and buy electric power in the trading market. The consumers with cogeneration systems can export the surplus power. The producers aim at the benefit maximization based on the Actor-Critic process. This model clarifies the behavior of power generation pattern and the trading price changes through the simulations.The second model focuses on the influence of the properties of energy equipments on the regional optimal energy planning. Cogeneration systems (CGS) and District Heating Systems (DHC) are often expected to contribute to the energy conservation and CO2 emission reduction in the commercial and residential buildings. However, since the contribution strongly depends on the regional conditions as well as the energy demand patterns, existing assessments have mainly dealt with the certain building or a district. In this paper, to evaluate the potential reduction of CGS and DHC more generally, we develop a GIS based energy system assessment model. We pick up seven regions of Utsunomiya-city which locates near Tokyo and has 450 thousand inhabitants, as a typical mid-size city of Japan. Applying GIS, we evaluate detailed energy demand statistics, which are then transferred to the energy flow model taking into account the properties of the energy equipments. This model is then applied to Utsunomiya, Naha and Sapporo which spread from south to north area of Japan. The model results suggest that although the climate condition of these three regions are different, we can observe a consistent relationship between the potential CO2 emission reduction rate and the ratio of commercial building floor area to the total floor and that 18.6% of CO2 emission from urban building area will be reduced by implementing such new energy equipments as HP, CGS and DHC with wheeling of surplus electric power.

TI  - Digital Twin for Modern Distribution Networks by Improved State Estimation with Consideration of Bad Date Identification
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of modern power systems, the structure and operation of distribution networks are becoming increasingly complex, demanding higher levels of intelligence and digitization. Digital twin, as a virtual cutting-edge technique, can effectively reflect the operational status of distribution networks, offering new possibilities for real-time monitoring, optimization and other functions for distribution networks. Building efficient and accurate models is the foundation of enabling a digital twin of distribution networks. This paper proposes a digital twin operating system for distribution networks with renewable energy based on robust state estimation and deep learning-based renewable energy prediction. Furthermore, the identification and correction of possible bad or missing data based on deep learning are also included to purify the input data for the digital twin system. A digital twin test platform is also proposed in the paper. A case study and evaluations based on a real-time digital simulator are carried out to verify the accuracy and real-time performance of the established digital twin system. In general, the proposed method can provide the basis and foundation for distribution network management and operation, as well as intelligent power system operation.

TI  - Reengineering and Its Reliability: An Analysis of Water Projects and Watershed Management under a Digital Twin Scheme in China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Water project and watershed management is currently being reengineered under digital twin schemes in China through pilot projects. An evaluation on pilot reengineering is important for its further implementation and improvement. This paper investigates national legislation and pilot projects' implementations of a digital twin watershed and digital twin water project from the perspectives of design, policy, technology, investment, personnel, cyberspace security, co-construction, and sharing through interviews and expert review, and it uses a Bayesian network to study their reliability. First, the design of the digital twin watershed and digital twin water project is reasonable with regard to system architecture and business management. Second, although there are some national legislations on cyberspace security and geospatial data, they are incomplete for policy making and are probably infeasible for some technology. Third, there are insufficient mechanisms to sustainably support investment, personnel, and cyberspace security. Forth, co-construction and sharing are required for both inside and outside water departments. Fifth, the Bayesian network is useful for investigating the reliability of weak nodes, and it is helpful for the design and further implementation of the digital twin watershed and digital twin water project, as will be demonstrated with an anonymous example. This study could provide useful insights into the further reengineering of water projects and watershed management under a digital twin scheme in the world.

TI  - GLLS for optimally sampled continuous dynamic system modeling: theory and algorithm
T2  - COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The original generalized linear least squares (GLLS) algorithm was developed for non-uniformly sampled biomedical system parameter estimation using finely sampled instantaneous measurements (D. Feng, S.C. Huang, Z. Wang, D. Ho, An unbiased parametric imaging algorithm for non-uniformly sampled biomedical system parameter estimation, IEEE Trans. Med. Imag. 15 (1996) 512-518). This algorithm is particularly useful for image-wide generation of parametric images with positron emission tomography (PET), as it is computationally efficient and statistically reliable (D. Feng, D. Ho, Chen, K., L.C. Wu, J.K. Wang, R.S. Liu, S.H. Yeh, An evaluation of the algorithms for determining local cerebral metabolic rates of glucose using positron emission tomography dynamic data, IEEE Trans. Med. Imag. 14 (1995) 697-710). However, when dynamic PET image data are sampled according to the optimal image sampling schedule (OISS) to reduce memory and storage space (X. Li, D. Feng, K. Chen, Optimal image sampling schedule: A new effective way to reduce dynamic image storage space and functional image processing time, IEEE Trans. Med. Imag. 15 (1996) 710-718), only a few temporal image frames are recorded (e.g. only four images are recorded for the four parameter fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) model). These image frames are recorded in terms of accumulated radio-activity counts and as a result, the direct application of GLLS is not reliable as instantaneous measurement samples can no longer be approximated by averaging of accumulated measurements over the sampling intervals. In this paper, we extend GLLS to OISS-GLLS which deals with the fewer accumulated measurement samples obtained from OISS dynamic systems. The theory and algorithm of this new technique are formulated and studied extensively. To investigate statistical reliability and computational efficiency of OISS-GLLS, a simulation study using dynamic PET data was performed. OISS-GLLS using 4-measurement samples was compared to the non-linear least squares (NLS) method using 22-measurement samples, GLLS using 22-measurement samples and OISS-NLS using 4-measurement samples. Results demonstrated that OISS-GLLS was able to achieve parameter estimates of equivalent accuracy and reliability in comparison to NLS or GLLS using finely sampled measurements (22-measurement samples), or OISS-NLS using optimally sampled measurements (4-measurement samples). Furthermore, as fewer measurement samples are used in OISS-GLLS, this algorithm is computationally faster than NLS or GLLS. Therefore, OISS-GLLS is well-suited for image-wide parameter estimation when PET image data are recorded according to the optimal image sampling schedule. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

TI  - The GIS-based SafeAirView software for the concentration assessment of radioactive pollutants after an accidental release
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) in Ispra (Italy) has long been running nuclear installations for research purposes. The Nuclear Decommissioning and Facilities Management Unit (NDFM) is responsible for the surveillance of radioactivity levels in nuclear emergency conditions. The NDFM Unit has commissioned the implementation of a specifically developed decision support system, which can be used for quick emergency evaluation in the case of hypothetical accident and for emergency exercises. The requisites were to be a user-friendly software, able to quickly calculate and display values of air and ground radioactive contamination in the complex area around JRC, following an accidental release of radioactive substances from a JRC nuclear research installation.The developed software, named "SafeAirView", is an advanced implementation of GIS technology applied to an existing MS-DOS mode dispersion model, SAFE-AIR (Simulation of Air pollution From Emissions-Above Inhomogeneous Regions). SAFE-AIR is a numerical model which simulates transport, diffusion, and deposition of airborne pollutants emitted in the low atmosphere above complex orography at both local and regional scale, under non-stationary and inhomogeneous emission and meteorological conditions.SafeAirView makes use of user-friendly MS-Windows type interface which drives the dispersion model by a sequential and continuous input-output process, allowing a real time simulation. The GIs environment allows a direct interaction with the territory elements in which the simulation takes place, using data for the JRC Ispra region represented in geo-referenced cartography. Furthermore it offers the possibility to relate concentrations with population distribution and other geo-referenced maps, in a geographic view. Output concentration and deposition patterns can be plotted and/or exported.In spite of the selected specific databases, the SafeAirView software architecture is a general structure, therefore the decision support system could be easily modified to be applied in a region different from the JRC one.Beside the description of SafeAirView, the present paper presents a statistical evaluation of the software, which has considered three well known tracer experiments: Copenhagen, Indianapolis and Kincaid. The data sets related to these experiments are all included in the so called Model Validation Kit. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

TI  - A Cross-Domain Systematic Mapping Study on Software Engineering for Digital Twins
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital Twins are currently investigated as the technological backbone for providing an enhanced understanding and management of existing systems as well as for designing new systems in various domains, e.g., ranging from single manufacturing components such as sensors to large-scale systems such as smart cities. Given the diverse application domains of Digital Twins, it is not surprising that the characterization of the term Digital Twin, as well as the needs for developing and operating Digital Twins are multi-faceted. Providing a better understanding what the commonalities and differences of Digital Twins in different contexts are, may allow to build reusable support for developing, running, and managing Digital Twins by providing dedicated concepts, techniques, and tool support. In this paper, we aim to uncover the nature of Digital Twins based on a systematic mapping study which is not limited to a particular application domain or technological space. We systematically retrieved a set of 1471 unique publications of which 356 were selected for further investigation. In particular, we analyzed the types of research and contributions made for Digital Twins, the expected properties Digital Twins have to fulfill, how Digital Twins are realized and operated, as well as how Digital Twins are finally evaluated. Based on this analysis, we also contribute a novel feature model for Digital Twins from a software engineering perspective as well as several observations to further guide future software engineering research in this area.

TI  - Digital twins-based flexible operating of open architecture production line for individualized manufacturing
T2  - ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Individualized manufacturing implies high flexibility of both the hardware and software of the production lines based on a fast physical and logical system (de)commissioning. This paper proposes an open architecture production line (OAPL) design together with a digital twins-based flexible operating approach for individualized manufacturing. Firstly, an OAPL is designed and implemented with physical reconfigurability by orchestrating different open architectural platforms together with open architecture machine tools (OAMTs). Secondly, an open architectural style modeling and configuration method is presented to enable the software reconfigurability of the controls of the OAPL. Thirdly, a digital twin-based online process emulating and multi-physics simulation is integrated to aid the comprehensive characterizing of the operation status of the OAPL. Based on the system reconfigurability and digital twins system, a triple-layer Learning-Optimization-Reacting approach together with an ensemble algorithm for flexible operating of the OAPL is proposed. The digital twins are formed with the ability to flexibly operate the OAPL for catering to different individualized requirements. A demonstrative implementation of a stepping-motor assembly OAPL is presented finally.

TI  - Predictive maintenance using digital twins: A systematic literature review
T2  - INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Context: Predictive maintenance is a technique for creating a more sustainable, safe, and profitable industry. One of the key challenges for creating predictive maintenance systems is the lack of failure data, as the machine is frequently repaired before failure. Digital Twins provide a real-time representation of the physical machine and generate data, such as asset degradation, which the predictive maintenance algorithm can use. Since 2018, scientific literature on the utilization of Digital Twins for predictive maintenance has accelerated, indicating the need for a thorough review.Objective: This research aims to gather and synthesize the studies that focus on predictive maintenance using Digital Twins to pave the way for further research.Method: A systematic literature review (SLR) using an active learning tool is conducted on published primary studies on predictive maintenance using Digital Twins, in which 42 primary studies have been analyzed.Results: This SLR identifies several aspects of predictive maintenance using Digital Twins, including the objectives, application domains, Digital Twin platforms, Digital Twin representation types, approaches, abstraction levels, design patterns, communication protocols, twinning parameters, and challenges and solution directions. These results contribute to a Software Engineering approach for developing predictive maintenance using Digital Twins in academics and the industry.Conclusion: This study is the first SLR in predictive maintenance using Digital Twins. We answer key questions for designing a successful predictive maintenance model leveraging Digital Twins. We found that to this day, computational burden, data variety, and complexity of models, assets, or components are the key challenges in designing these models.

AB  - Sustainable software systems aim to create resource-efficient software products and reduce the carbon impact of applications. Current approaches for sustainability assessment of software are either only focused on their operation or rely on methods in their engineering. More holistic approaches for sustainable software system spanning are missing. Thus, we are interested in the engineering of sustainable software systems together with the monitoring of their sustainability goals over their whole lifetime. Within this paper, we suggest using digital twins to accompany software systems in all life cycle phases with a specific focus on using model-driven engineering methods for the creation of applications. We can generate accompanying digital twins which share relevant models and data with the actual system and provide services for the assessment of sustainability indicators. In the long run, this provides us with better assessment options for software systems.

AB  - 
                   NOVELTY - The method involves processing a query (QRY)                against current set of stored graph data (GRD) by                using graph-query- language. Inputted Constraints                (CST) on nodes and edges are evaluated against the                data. Constraint-violations callback functions                (CBF) specify location of constraint-violation are                detected. Results (RES) of modeling of entity,                constraint evaluation, query processing and                evaluation of inputted constraint concern actions                of modeling, specifying, inputting, evaluating or                processing and functions specify location of                constraint-violations for visualizing and                outputting are edited.

                    ADVANTAGE - The method enables engineering/maintaining                sophisticated parts or aspects of the complex                cyber-physical system in an efficient and                cost-effective manner. The method enables                performing faster re-certification when an impact                of changes in design is evaluated automatically,                thus avoiding conducting certification process for                components that are not affected by the change. The                method enables performing dynamic visualizations                using user-defined Views, Templates, Constraints,                Queries and filters that are applied across                architectural Views in an efficient manner. The                method enables performing faster design space                exploration, while allowing for efficient                development and collaboration across                disciplines.

AB  - Many contexts can be found where data reside in silos, which presents challenges for supporting decision making that relies on data from multiple silos. Digital twins (DTs) have the potential to integrate heterogeneous data sources and overcome these challenges, but little has been published in this regard. This paper proposes a DT system architecture aimed at DTs that integrate data from different data silos. The architecture combines a hierarchy of DTs and a services network. A case study in railway infrastructure serves as an implementation example for preliminary evaluation.

TI  - Process Algebraic Approach for Probabilistic Verification of Safety and Security Requirements of Smart IoT (Internet of Things) Systems in Digital Twin
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Process algebra can be considered one of the most practical formal methods for modeling Smart IoT Systems in Digital Twin, since each IoT device in the systems can be considered as a process. Further, some of the algebras are applied to predict the behavior of the systems. For example, PALOMA (Process Algebra for Located Markovian Agents) and PACSR (Probabilistic Algebra of Communicating Shared Resources) process algebras are designed to predict the behavior of IoT Systems with probability on choice operations. However, there is a lack of analytical methods in the algebras to predict the nondeterministic behavior of the systems. Further, there is no control mechanism to handle undesirable nondeterministic behavior of the systems. In order to overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a new process algebra, called dTP-Calculus, which can be used (1) to specify the nondeterministic behavior of the systems with static probability, (2) verify the safety and security requirements of the nondeterministic behavior with probability requirements, and (3) control undesirable nondeterministic behavior with dynamic probability. To demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of the approach, the SAVE (Specification, Analysis, Verification, Evaluation) tool has been developed on the ADOxx Meta-Modeling Platform and applied to a SEMS (Smart Emergency Medical Service) example. In addition, a miniature digital twin system for the SEMS example was constructed and applied to the SAVE tool as a proof of concept for Digital Twin. It shows that the approach with dTP-Calculus on the tool can be very efficient and effective for Smart IoT Systems in Digital Twin.

TI  - Operation analysis and parameter optimization of the conveying device for uniform crushed straw throwing and seed-sowing machines
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Uniform crushed straw throwing and seed-sowing machines can achieve the processes of straw chopping, straw transport, sowing, fertilization, and straw mulching at the same time, which is widely used in many areas of China. Conveying device is one of the important components used to convey, elevate and throw straw. However, the problems of high power consumption and congestion affect the promotion of the machine. Therefore, the conveying device of uniform crushed straw throwing and seed-sowing machine was analyzed in order to determine its device operation mechanism. Kinematic and dynamic analyses of particles of crushed rice straw during lifting and dispersion are used to develop a flexible -body model of rod-shaped and agglomerate-shaped crushed straw and a coupling model including the mechanical structure of the device. By integrating computational fluid dynamics and the discrete element method, the gas -solid coupling theory in numerical simulations and motion analysis of crushed straw particles is used to determine how the flow field and motion characteristics affect the conveying performance. Besides, regression equations to describe the relationships between the factors and each assessment index were established by using the regression analysis and response surface analysis with the software DesignExpert. The effect of throwing blade speed X1, conveying volume of crushed straw X2, and pipeline diameter X3 on the throwing speed of crushed straw Y1 and specific power consumption Y2 were investigated.

AB  - Accelerated by current research on the Internet of Things, working with virtual models and things has taken a significant step forward. The term digital twins refers to the development of virtual models of processes, products or services that allow the simulation of system behavior and the early detection of problems before the real system exists. Simulations have been state of the art for a long time, but with the service-oriented possibilities of the Internet a new quality of simulation results. In the meantime, it has become possible, for example, to configure a virtual computer on the Internet and run algorithms on it without this computer in fact existing, see e.g. AWS (AMAZON web services). This paper discusses possibilities that the digital twin concept can offer to educational purposes in remote and virtual laboratories.

TI  - Integrated Digital Twins System for Oil Temperature Prediction of Power Transformer Based on Internet of Things
T2  - IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil temperature is an important index to reflect the state of transformer and predict the fault and remaining useful life of transformer. However, the oil temperature of the transformer is affected by various factors, such as weather conditions, load changes, holidays, seasons, and so on. In order to predict oil temperature more accurately, this study proposes a VCEEMDAN data decomposition algorithm to extract the characteristics of oil temperature data. And we proposed a hybrid long-term series forecasting model of oil temperature based on VCEEMDAN, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Informer. At the same time, the digital twins system of the manipulator is configured to assist personnel in maintenance when the oil temperature is abnormal. And the digital twins system of an oil-immersed power transformer to monitoring of transformer status. Finally, the above research is integrated into a digital twins system, including transformer condition monitoring, oil temperature prediction, and intelligent maintenance based on Internet of Things (IOT). The proposed prediction method was compared with the six existing models on three datasets. From the experimental results, the best index improvement is 77.97% higher than the second-best model. And the simulation system can provide a good reference for the practical application of the factory. This article presents a hybrid framework that achieves a accurate transformer oil temperature prediction.

AB  - Based on an ethnographic action research study for a Digital Twin (DT) deployment on an automated highway maintenance project, this paper reports some of the stumbling blocks that practitioners face while deploying a DT in practice. At the outset, the scope of the case study was broadly defined in terms of digitalization and software development and deployment, which later pivoted toward the concept of Digital Twin during the collective reflection sessions between the project participants. Through an iterative learning cycle via discussions among the various project stakeholders, the case study led to uncovering the roadblocks in practice faced by the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) practitioners. This research finds that the practitioners are facing difficulty in (1) creating a shared understanding among the participants due to the lack of consensus on the Digital Twin concept, (2) adapting and investing in Digital Twin due to inability to exhaustively evaluate and select the appropriate technological capabilities in a Digital Twin, and (3) allocation of resources for Digital Twin development due to the inability to assess the impact of DT on the organizational conditions and processes.

TI  - HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP DIGITAL TWIN FRAMEWORK FOR ERGONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF EXOSKELETONS IN CONSTRUCTION
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Exoskeletons are increasingly recognized as ergonomic solutions for work-related musculoskeletal disorders in the construction industry. However, users of active back-support exoskeletons are susceptible to various physical and psychological risks, which could be exoskeleton-type or task-dependent. A test bed is needed to enable deployment and assessment of risks associated with exoskeleton use for construction tasks. This study presents a human-in-the-loop digital twin framework for assessing ergonomic risks associated with using active back-support exoskeletons for construction work. Through a literature review, a digital twin system architecture for assessing risks associated with active back-support exoskeletons was developed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to identify construction tasks that are most suitable for active back-support exoskeletons. Based on the identified tasks, a laboratory experiment was conducted to quantify the risks associated with the use of a commercially available active back-support exoskeleton for carpentry framing tasks. The efficacy of the digital twin framework is demonstrated with an example of the classification of exertion levels due to exoskeleton use using a 1D-convolutional neural network. The results show that the performance of the model improved significantly with synthetic data. The dashboard provides a visualization of exertion risk classification outcomes to aid decision-making. The study highlights the potential of digital twins for ergonomic assessment, allowing stakeholders to proactively address ergonomic risks and optimize the use of exoskeletons in the construction industry. This study sets a precedent for future research on using digital twins to monitor the performance of exoskeletons in construction. Such efforts could enhance the sustainability of exoskeleton solutions in construction workplaces.

TI  - Integration of Railway Bridge Structural Health Monitoring into the Internet of Things with a Digital Twin: A Case Study
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Structural health monitoring (SHM) is critical for ensuring the safety of infrastructure such as bridges. This article presents a digital twin solution for the SHM of railway bridges using low-cost wireless accelerometers and machine learning (ML). The system architecture combines on-premises edge computing and cloud analytics to enable efficient real-time monitoring and complete storage of relevant time-history datasets. After train crossings, the accelerometers stream raw vibration data, which are processed in the frequency domain and analyzed using machine learning to detect anomalies that indicate potential structural issues. The digital twin approach is demonstrated on an in-service railway bridge for which vibration data were collected over two years under normal operating conditions. By learning allowable ranges for vibration patterns, the digital twin model identifies abnormal spectral peaks that indicate potential changes in structural integrity. The long-term pilot proves that this affordable SHM system can provide automated and real-time warnings of bridge damage and also supports the use of in-house-designed sensors with lower cost and edge computing capabilities such as those used in the demonstration. The successful on-premises-cloud hybrid implementation provides a cost effective and scalable model for expanding monitoring to thousands of railway bridges, democratizing SHM to improve safety by avoiding catastrophic failures.

TI  - Intelligent digital-twin prediction and reverse control system architecture for thermal errors enabled by deep learning and cloud-edge computing
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The heat generation is significant in the machining process, leading to thermal errors, and finally the geometric precision of machined parts is reduced. So the precision machine tool is a key factor in determining the geometric precision of complex parts. In recent years, the error control method is applied. But the method fails in reducing thermal errors because it cannot effectively process large-volume data, resulting from its low executing efficiency. To solve above issues, a new intelligent digital-twin prediction and reverse control system is designed for thermally induced errors based on the user-edge-cloud architecture to expedite the executing efficiency. The data-driven error modeling method is augmented by an error mechanism-based modeling to express the thermal error as a function with the temperature, armature current, rotational speed, and ambient temperature as independent variables, and then the long-term memorizing behavior of thermal errors is demonstrated. The error model is established based on an improved wavelet threshold denoising (IWTD) and a (long short-term memory) LSTM network to describe the memorizing behavior, and IWTD-LSTM network error prediction model is embedded into the digital-twin system. The digital-twin system and IWTD-LSTM network model were verified on a precision machine tool. With the implementation of the digital-twin system, the thermal error and the volume of the transferred data are reduced by 88.72% and 56.36%, respectively.

T2  - 2024 IEEE INTERNATIONAL PERFORMANCE, COMPUTING, AND COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE, IPCCC
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 2024 International Performance Computing and Communications Conference
CL  - Orlando, FL
AB  - The rapid advancements in nanotechnology and neuromorphic engineering have paved the way for developing high-performance computational models that mimic biological neural networks. This paper presents a novel digital-twin architecture for a spiking neuron, leveraging the exceptional properties of Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistors (CNFETs). The proposed architecture aims to emulate the dynamic behavior of biological neurons with high fidelity, providing a robust platform for simulation and analysis. By integrating CNFETs, we achieve significant improvements in lowest-energy usage and highest-spiking frequency, compared to traditional silicon-based technologies. Furthermore, the digital twin not only replicates the electrical characteristics of a spiking neuron but also facilitates advanced functionalities such as adaptive learning, fault tolerance, and self-optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of CNFET-based neurons in enhancing the performance of neuromorphic systems, offering promising applications in artificial intelligence, cognitive computing, and complex system modeling. Integrating digital twin technology with CNFETs allows for precise control and manipulation of spiking behavior, enabling the development of more sophisticated and efficient neural models. This research underscores the transformative impact of combining digital twin technology with cutting-edge nanomaterials, setting a new benchmark for future explorations in the field. The findings highlight the importance of continued research and development in this area, as it holds the promise of revolutionizing the way we design and implement neuromorphic systems, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in artificial intelligence and beyond.

TI  - Deep Learning-Empowered Digital Twin Using Acoustic Signal for Welding Quality Inspection
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Weld site inspection is a research area of interest in the manufacturing industry. In this study, a digital twin system for welding robots to examine various weld flaws that might happen during welding using the acoustics of the weld site is presented. Additionally, a wavelet filtering technique is implemented to remove the acoustic signal originating from machine noise. Then, an SeCNN-LSTM model is applied to recognize and categorize weld acoustic signals according to the traits of strong acoustic signal time sequences. The model verification accuracy was found to be 91%. In addition, using numerous indicators, the model was compared with seven other models, namely, CNN-SVM, CNN-LSTM, CNN-GRU, BiLSTM, GRU, CNN-BiLSTM, and LSTM. A deep learning model, and acoustic signal filtering and preprocessing techniques are integrated into the proposed digital twin system. The goal of this work was to propose a systematic on-site weld flaw detection approach encompassing data processing, system modeling, and identification methods. In addition, our proposed method could serve as a resource for pertinent research.

T2  - IEEE NETWORK
M3  - Article
AB  - Mobile artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) refers to the adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) algorithms deployed at mobile edge networks to automate the information creation process while fulfilling the requirements of end users. Mobile AIGC has recently attracted phenomenal attentions and can be a key enabling technology for an emerging application, called human digital twin (HDT). HDT empowered by the mobile AIGC is expected to revolutionize the personalized healthcare by generating rare disease data, modeling highfidelity digital twin, building versatile testbeds, and providing 24/7 customized medical services. To promote the development of this new breed of paradigm, in this article, we propose a system architecture of mobile AIGC-driven HDT and highlight the corresponding design requirements and challenges. Moreover, we illustrate two use cases, i.e., mobile AIGC-driven HDT in customized surgery planning and personalized medication. In addition, we conduct an experimental study to prove the effectiveness of the proposed mobile AIGC-driven HDT solution, which shows a particular application in a virtual physical therapy teaching platform. Finally, we conclude this article by briefly discussing several open issues and future directions.

TI  - A Digital Twin-Based Approach for Designing and Multi-Objective Optimization of Hollow Glass Production Line
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Various new national advanced manufacturing strategies, such as Industry 4.0, Industrial Internet, and Made in China 2025, are issued to achieve smart manufacturing, resulting in the increasing number of newly designed production lines in both developed and developing countries. Under the individualized designing demands, more realistic virtual models mirroring the real worlds of production lines are essential to bridge the gap between design and operation. This paper presents a digital twin-based approach for rapid individualized designing of the hollow glass production line. The digital twin merges physics-based system modeling and distributed real-time process data to generate an authoritative digital design of the system at pre-production phase. A digital twin-based analytical decoupling framework is also developed to provide engineering analysis capabilities and support the decision-making over the system designing and solution evaluation. Three key enabling techniques as well as a case study in hollow glass production line are addressed to validate the proposed approach.

                   NOVELTY - The method involves functionally dividing (S1)                integrated energy cyber-physical system into energy                layer, transmission and information layer. The                energy flow equations of the three energy networks                of electricity, heat and gas are expressed as a                unified network matrix equation based on unified                energy path theory. A transport layer model is                established (S2) that describes the data                transmission process by establishing the                communication channel model of energy station                operation data in the energy network and interface                model connecting energy and information layer. An                information layer model describing the optimal                decision-making process of the control center is                established (S3). The information receiving matrix                of the information layer model is updated, and the                control center optimizes the decision-making output                control command and sends back to the energy layer                according to the obtained energy flow matrix. The                energy layer updates the energy flow matrix                according to the instructions.

TI  - ManuChain II: Blockchained Smart Contract System as the Digital Twin of Decentralized Autonomous Manufacturing Toward Resilience in Industry 5.0
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Industry 5.0 vision, machines are empowered with the interaction capability to autonomously make local decisions and coordinate with each other as well as humans. However, how to form a group consensus on the rapid self-organizing of the manufacturing process is critical for achieving manufacturing resilience under disturbances and disruptions. Based on our formerly developed system ManuChain (Leng et al., 2020), this article proposes a blockchained smart contract system (BSCS), named ManuChain II, as the digital twin of a decentralized autonomous manufacturing system for achieving resilience in Industry 5.0. A blockchain-secured multiagent system architecture together with a product data model is established to form the BSCS. The BSCS could prevent tampering with data and enhance the transparency of the product manufacturing process. In BSCS, two types of blockchained smart contracts (SCs) are established with a bi-level interplay computing architecture. The lower-level contracts perform the predefined and learned patterns of task coordination for achieving resilience under internal disruptions. The upper-level contracts are incorporated with communication-efficient decentralized deep-learning algorithms for the learning, updating, transferring, and sharing of coordination patterns used in the autonomous decision in lower-level SCs, thereby achieving the continuous improvement of the system's decentralized autonomous intelligence. Via incorporating the decentralized deep learning algorithms into blockchained SCs, this study reveals a new way to realize the self-organizing intelligence of the manufacturing system for enhancing resilience toward Industry 5.0.

AB  - Harbin University of Technology Engineering Innovation Practice Center, in engineering training teaching, uses the teaching methods of virtual and reality, and inducts the digital twin software of RioD into the engineering practice teaching work. The digital twin software of RioD is used to build the intelligent manufacturing production line work scene, and completes the following four tasks: first the product leaves from the intelligent warehouse, then AGV transports the product to the transit platform, second, the robot grabs the product and completes the task of clamping and removing, and finally the work scene resets. Through virtual technology, the real production line is built in virtual space, which effectively solves the difficult problem that the practical teaching task can't be carried out, and significantly improves the quality of practical teaching, and stimulates student interest.

AB  - Aiming at the problems of low motion efficiency of the robotic arm in the space full of obstacles and the inability to monitor the operation status in real time, this paper firstly designs the digital twin system architecture to realize the virtual reality mapping and interaction. Secondly, considering the requirement of robotic arm path planning, a digital twin-based APF-SAC path planning method is proposed, which optimizes the path generated by the artificial potential field method as the reference path and incorporates it into the reward function to accelerate the convergence speed of the traditional SAC algorithm, and introduces the recent experience playback technology to improve the stability and speed of training. Experiments based on the proposed algorithm show that the path imitation mechanism can improve the training efficiency, and the APF-SAC algorithm can plan the path more reasonably compared with the PPO algorithm. On this basis, the digital twin system is used to realize the real-time preview of the algorithm, which ensures the availability of the path and the safety of the robotic arm.

TI  - Digital twin-based process reuse and evaluation approach for smart process planning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the advances in new-generation information technologies, smart process planning is becoming the focus for smart process planning with less time and lower cost. Big data-based reusing and evaluating the multi-dimensional process knowledge is widely accepted as an effective strategy for improving competitiveness of enterprises. However, there was little research on how to reuse and evaluate process knowledge with dynamical changing machining status. In this paper, we propose a novel digital twin-based approach for reusing and evaluating process knowledge. First, the digital twin-based process knowledge model which contains the geometric information and real-time process equipment status is introduced to represent the purpose and requirement of machining planning. Second, the process big data is constructed based on the three-layer and its association rules for accumulating process knowledge. Moreover, the similarity calculation algorithm of the scene model is proposed to filter the unmatched process knowledge. For accurately reusing the process knowledge, the process reusability evaluation approach of the candidate knowledge set is presented based on the real-time machining status and the calculated confidence. Finally, the diesel engine parts are applied in the developed prototype module to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method can promote the development and application of the smart process planning.

AB  - Technology enabled learning and communication are at the crossroads, which need flexible solutions. Flexible learning enables a learner to move seamlessly between the real and virtual world. We propose a novel flexible communication tool, "the smart book" to address these challenges. First, we review the role of the traditional book, its role in society today and the recent advances in augmented reality books. Next, we present a novel approach that integrates digital twins and mixed realities that is useful in communication, learning and for making decisions. We propose an initial vision of the architecture. Finally, we follow the Spiral of Creative Thought to create a first prototype with promising results. Our plan to further develop the architecture is to integrate this spiral with other software development methods. We need further iterations within the spiral to include final users and diverse applications.

TI  - Enabling automated engineering's project progress measurement by using data flow models and digital twins
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A significant challenge of managing successful engineering projects is to know their status at any time. This paper describes a concept of automated project progress measurement based on data flow models, digital twins, and machine learning (ML) algorithms. The approach integrates information from previous projects by considering historical data using ML algorithms and current unfinished artifacts to determine the degree of completion. The information required to measure the progress of engineering activities is extracted from engineering artifacts and subsequently analyzed and interpreted according to the project's progress. Data flow models of the engineering process help understand the context of the analyzed artifacts. The use of digital twins makes it possible to connect plan data with actual data during the completion of the engineering project.

TI  - Optimizing near-carbon-free nuclear energy systems: advances in reactor operation digital twin through hybrid machine learning algorithms for parameter identification and state estimation
T2  - NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and efficient online parameter identification and state estimation are crucial for leveraging digital twin simulations to optimize the operation of near-carbon-free nuclear energy systems. In previous studies, we developed a reactor operation digital twin (RODT). However, non-differentiabilities and discontinuities arise when employing machine learning-based surrogate forward models, challenging traditional gradient-based inverse methods and their variants. This study investigated deterministic and metaheuristic algorithms and developed hybrid algorithms to address these issues. An efficient modular RODT software framework that incorporates these methods into its post-evaluation module is presented for comprehensive comparison. The methods were rigorously assessed based on convergence profiles, stability with respect to noise, and computational performance. The numerical results show that the hybrid KNNLHS algorithm excels in real-time online applications, balancing accuracy and efficiency with a prediction error rate of only 1% and processing times of less than 0.1 s. Contrastingly, algorithms such as FSA, DE, and ADE, although slightly slower (approximately 1 s), demonstrated higher accuracy with a 0.3% relative L2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$L_2$$\end{document} error, which advances RODT methodologies to harness machine learning and system modeling for improved reactor monitoring, systematic diagnosis of off-normal events, and lifetime management strategies. The developed modular software and novel optimization methods presented offer pathways to realize the full potential of RODT for transforming energy engineering practices.

TI  - Agile Construction Digital Twin Engineering
T2  - BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital twins have attracted a lot of attention recently. However, the current manifestations are merely digital shadows, lacking means for bidirectional data exchange, which makes their use for assisting the construction of buildings much more difficult. We argue that this is due to the lack of a systematic process for developing a digital twin during a building's life cycle. We argue to look for a solution by combining agile engineering with IT change management to establish an agile, change-driven process for engineering digital twins. Such a process, of course, deserves a qualitative assessment of the engineering process and the resulting digital twin. In the future, it should be possible to obtain a digital twin from a BIM-based design process by applying IT change management in an agile manner. This should happen under maximum automation and life cycle orientation. Our proposal is motivated by several years of interdisciplinary collaboration between civil engineering and computer science and evaluated using the Technology Acceptance Model. While the TAM is not specifically designed for digital twin methodologies, its application here aims to assess perceived usefulness and ease of use of DT methodologies from the user's perspective, without addressing scalability concerns. This aims to provide actionable insights to guide the refinement of the process model, aligning it with user requirements and achieving its intended outcomes. Our evaluation confirms the proposed process's perceived usefulness and ease of use, with robust correlations indicating strong acceptance potential among stakeholders. These results highlight the feasibility of the proposed approach and its alignment with expectations in real-world applications.

T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensor technologies empower Industry 4.0 by enabling integration of in-field and real-time raw data into digital twins. However, sensors might be unreliable due to inherent issues and/or environmental conditions. This article aims at detecting anomalies in measurements from sensors, identifying the faulty ones and accommodating them with appropriate estimated data, thus paving the way to reliable digital twins. More specifically, we propose a general machine-learning-based architecture for sensor validation built upon a series of neural-network estimators and a classifier. Estimators correspond to virtual sensors of all unreliable sensors (to reconstruct normal behaviour and replace the isolated faulty sensor within the system), whereas the classifier is used for detection and isolation tasks. A comprehensive statistical analysis on three different real-world data-sets is conducted and the performance of the proposed architecture validated under hard and soft synthetically-generated faults.

AB  - The Oil and Gas industry is facing complex challenges including spiralling exploration and development costs, aging assets, long lead times on equipment, shortage of skilled people, among others. As such, it is imperative existing assets are operated efficiently and properly maintained to maximise production. A typical approach to achieve this objective considers industry best practices, international standards, manufacturer recommendations and condition monitoring techniques such as oil analysis, vibration, thermography, ultrasound, etc.However, the advent of Industry 4.0 has promoted the development and adoption of advanced techniques: a prominent example being the Digital-Twin concept. A Digital-Twin is a virtual model developed using advanced modelling and data handling techniques to replicate and predict the behaviour of individual equipment or entire production systems. A Digital-Twin approach can deliver predictive monitoring capabilities; analysis of complex systems; define solutions to operational issues; virtual testing and confirmation of proposed modifications; etc.This paper presents the development of a Digital-Twin for troubleshooting and operations optimisation of a motor-driven three-stage gas-lift compression system with a long history of unstable operation, recurrent emergency shutdown events and low availability. The multidisciplinary approach includes analysis of the control system architecture, assessment of field instrumentation, data validation, performance benchmarking, dynamic modelling and off-line control system testing. A cost-effective solution with only minor software modifications was designed, tested and demonstrated before its implementation. The successful outcome of the project reduced the need for constant operator intervention, reduced emergency shutdown events, increased availability of the gas compression system from 86% to 98.2%, reduced gas imports, increased gas exports and enhanced oil production.

TI  - Digital Twin-Enabled Online Battlefield Learning with Random Finite Sets
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The digital twin is becoming the most promising emerging technology in the field of unmanned combat and has the potential to innovate future combat styles. Online battlefield learning is one of the key technologies for supporting the successful application of digital twin in unmanned combat. Since there is an urgent need for effective algorithms for online learning the battlefield states in real time, a new random finite set- (RFS-) based algorithm is proposed in the presence of detection uncertainty including clutters, missed detection, and noises. The system architecture and operational mode for implementing the digital twin-enabled online battlefield learning are provided. The unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) is employed as the experimental subject for systematically describing the proposed algorithm. The system architecture for implementing the digital twin-enabled online battlefield learning is firstly given, and its operational mode is also described in detail. The RFS-based digital twin models including the battlefield state model, UGV motion model, and sensor model are designed. The Bayesian inference is adopted, and the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter is modified to implement the online learning process. At last, a group of experiments are conducted to verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The research work in this paper will provide a good demonstration of the application of digital twin in unmanned combat.

AB  - The new seminar "Digital Twins for Virtual Commissioning of Production Machines" follows a technical approach that uses virtualization and offers the possibility to pursue an uncommon teaching method called problem-based learning (PBL). The seminar is divided into two parts, with fundamental theoretical knowledge in automation technology and systems modeling provided first. In the second part, the students use the dedicated software environment to edit projects on their own, and at this point the PBL approach is used. This method enables students to self-organize their learning process and take an active part in the seminar. The idea for the seminar and virtual teaching lab evolved from the industrial use case of testing software for programmable logic controllers (PLCs) without the real machine, using virtual commissioning (VC). The primary effort of VC lies in the manual creation of a digital representation of each mechatronic component providing the same behavior seen from PLC perspective. Students are taught to do this, create the so-called digital twin (DT).

TI  - Genetic algorithm optimization for parametrization, digital twinning, and now-casting of unknown small- and medium-scale PV systems based only on on-site measured data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately predicting and balancing energy generation and consumption are crucial for grid operators and asset managers in a market where renewable energy is increasing. To speed up the process, these predictions should ideally be performed based only on on-site measured data and data available within the monitoring platforms, data which are scarce for small- and medium-scale PV systems. In this study, we propose an algorithm that can now-cast the power output of a photovoltaic (PV) system with high accuracy. Additionally, it offers physical information related to the configuration of such a PV system. We adapted a genetic algorithm-based optimization approach to parametrize a digital twin of unknown PV systems, using only on-site measured PV power and irradiance in the plane of array. We compared several training datasets under various sky conditions. A mean deviation of -1.14 W/kW(p) and a mean absolute percentage deviation of 1.81% were obtained when we analyzed the accuracy of the PV power now-casting for the year 2020 of the 16 unknown PV systems used for this analysis. This level of accuracy is significant for ensuring the efficient now-casting and operation of PV assets.

TI  - V-Cockpit: A Platform for the Design, Testing, and Validation of Car Infotainment Systems through Virtual Reality
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The V-Cockpit platform aims to transform the design, testing, and validation of car infotainment systems from the physical realm to virtual reality. It uniquely integrates various aspects of the creative phases-from conceptualization to evaluation-streamlining the process and reducing time and costs compared to traditional methods that focus on individual activities and rely heavily on physical prototyping. This technical note provides a comprehensive overview of the main platform's aspects, highlighting the integration of hardware and behavioral analysis algorithms to improve user experience and detect potential design flaws early on. The V-Cockpit platform, composed of six key components, leverages virtual reality and digital twins, promising significant cost savings and enhanced design efficiency. This work details the system architecture, implementation, and first benefits of this innovative approach through the analysis of three use cases.

TI  - Real-Time Analysis of Multiple Root Causes for Anomalies Assisted by Digital Twin in NFV Environment
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a promising paradigm that enables the employment of novel service types with lower deployment cost and faster time-to-value, but it introduces new fault management problems and challenges. In NFV environment, anomalies occurred in virtual machines (VMs) can be caused by faulty components of their hosting servers or anomaly propagation from other ones. If the performance of VMs degrades, we need to find out the root causes accurately, i.e., locate the exact faulty components, to recover the networks as soon as possible. In this paper, we first use digital twin to establish a virtual instance of the physical network to capture the real-time anomaly-fault dependency relationship. When the network environment changes, transfer learning is leveraged to utilize the learned knowledge of dependency relationship in historical periods to avoid huge time and computation cost of learning from scratch. Assisted by the learned dependency relationship, a dynamic set-covering (DSC) based root caused analysis problem is formulated and modeled with a set of parallel hidden Markov models to capture the dynamics of component states, which can best explain the sequence of anomalous VMs. We use alternating direction method of multipliers to decompose the DSC problem into a set of independent sub-problems and solve it in a distributed fashion. Since the state variables of each component in the DSC problem are coupled between any two successive time epochs, each sub-problem is solved by the Viterbi decoding and an incremental function is designed to construct the feasible solution that covers all anomalous VMs. Simulation results show the availability and superiority of the digital-twin assisted root cause analysis algorithm for NFV environment.

TI  - Advances in artificial intelligence and digital twin for tunnel boring machines
T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The deep integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and tunnel boring machine (TBM) has emerged as a critical research direction in intelligent tunnel construction. However, variable geological conditions, numerous electromechanical systems, and complex rock-machine interactions pose significant challenges to its implementation. This paper systematically reviews the latest research advances of AI in the TBM field, focusing on key technologies such as environmental perception, automated control, and predictive health management. Additionally, an intelligent TBM system architecture based on Digital Twin (DT) technology is proposed. The architecture integrates and coordinates a perception layer, an analysis layer, a decision-making layer, and an execution layer, enabling full-process autonomous control from environmental perception to intelligent decision-making. Finally, several critical issues and prospects in developing intelligent TBM, including data integration, model interpretability, and computational efficiency are discussed. This study aims to provide theoretical references and practical guidance for researchers in related fields, further promoting the in-depth application and development of digital twin technology in the intelligent TBM domain.

TI  - Manufacturing Operator Ergonomics: A Conceptual Digital Twin Approach to Detect Biomechanical Fatigue
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary sources of injuries in the workplace are improper manual material handling (MMH) motions, forklift collisions, slip, and fall. This research presents a Digital Twin (DT) framework to analyze fatigue in humans while performing lifting MMH activity in a laboratory environment for the purpose of reducing these types of injuries. The proposed methodology analyzes the worker's body joints to detect biomechanical fatigue as a factor of change in back, elbow, and knee joint angles. Using the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm, the change in joint angles with time was analyzed. The variation in DTW parameters was evaluated using exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts for further analysis. A preliminary study considering two healthy male subjects performing seven experiments, each under an optical motion capture system was performed to test the model's efficiency. Our contributions are twofold. First, we propose a model to detect biomechanical fatigue in the subjects performing MMH lifting activity as a change in joint angles. Secondly, the research also shows evidence that different individuals show signs of body fatigue via different body joints and showcases the need for a true personalized DT for an operator for fatigue assessment in an MMH environment.

AB  - The digital twin paradigm is a promising enabling technology to accelerate the decarbonisation of industrial sites that use process heat. With digital representations that look-like, behave-like, and connect to a physical system, digital twins bring together critical operational and asset data into a single knowledge store. However, a high-fidelity digital twin relying on the cloud in real-time with direct influence on operations exposes the plant to cyber attacks. We propose a software architecture for a Digital Twin that adaptively generates more accurate representations of its operations to detect malicious activities and mitigate their effects. To achieve this adaptivity, our solution leverages ML, time-series forecasting, concept drift detection and control stability analysis. To evaluate our solution, we develop a simulation of a simple industrial plant consisting of one PID-controlled steam-boiler and a variety of uncertainties. Our experimental evaluation suggests that Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control, a system identification technique, best contributes towards Self-Learning by producing verifiable models that better align the need for retraining with concept drifts.

AB  - The introduction of Docker containers ushered the emergence of microservices to facilitate efficient ways to deploy and manage containerized applications. Digital Twins in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) has enabled advances in the test and evaluation of those systems in a low-cost and non-disruptive manner. In this paper, we present our work on advancing the security of Industrial Control Systems through a four-pronged approach: i) provide a safe training infrastructure for ICS security; ii) present an effective avenue for ICS security testing without operational disruption; iii) implement ICS digital twins to enable ICS security training; and iv) facilitate the design, implementation, and evaluation of ICS security tools. To realize these objectives, we propose the utilization of Open Platform Infrastructure (OPI) with Docker technologies to deploy virtualized Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), also known as softPLC, and Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) that can emulate or act as digital twins of ICS. Further, we describe several docker containers instantiated from Dockerfiles to emulate typical Information Technology (IT) and Operation Technology (OT) networks to illustrate the viability and affordability of such implementations for teaching, learning, and testing of ICS security.

AB  - Nowadays, the automation industry is undergoing many changes, manufactures must react to fast changing market demands and more individual customer requirements. Recept-based, Service-Oriented Architectures enable the efficient adaption of production processes to new operating conditions. However, to ensure production performance, service-oriented production should also be complemented by adequate scheduling approaches to guarantee critical performance factors. We present a Digital Twin-based approach that performs integrated process planning and scheduling for service-based production. For our approach, we have identified a common set of input data required for integrated process planning and scheduling. We use DeepQ-Network, which is a deep Reinforcement Learning method, to derive near optimal schedules for production conditions described in Digital Twins. If an unforseen event happens during the production, our approach is able to adapt current schedules to the changed operating conditions. The case study shows that our approach is able to derive near optimal schedules for customized products and adapt its currents schedules for new orders with different production goals.

TI  - Towards a Distributed Digital Twin Framework for Predictive Maintenance in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses a wind turbine case study as a subdomain of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to showcase an architecture for implementing a distributed digital twin in which all important aspects of a predictive maintenance solution in a DT use a fog computing paradigm, and the typical predictive maintenance DT is improved to offer better asset utilization and management through real-time condition monitoring, predictive analytics, and health management of selected components of wind turbines in a wind farm. Digital twin (DT) is a technology that sits at the intersection of Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, and Software Engineering to provide a suitable tool for replicating physical objects in the digital space. This can facilitate the implementation of asset management in manufacturing systems through predictive maintenance solutions leveraged by machine learning (ML). With DTs, a solution architecture can easily use data and software to implement asset management solutions such as condition monitoring and predictive maintenance using acquired sensor data from physical objects and computing capabilities in the digital space. While DT offers a good solution, it is an emerging technology that could be improved with better standards, architectural framework, and implementation methodologies. Researchers in both academia and industry have showcased DT implementations with different levels of success. However, DTs remain limited in standards and architectures that offer efficient predictive maintenance solutions with real-time sensor data and intelligent DT capabilities. An appropriate feedback mechanism is also needed to improve asset management operations.

TI  - Digital Twin and federated learning enabled cyberthreat detection system for IoT networks
T2  - FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The widespread deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices across various smart city applications presents significant security challenges, increased by the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats. Traditional security solutions, including those using Federated Learning with federated averaging, suffer from inefficiencies due to random node selection and partial data sampling, which can hinder the detection of comprehensive networkwide attacks. This paper introduces a novel Cyberthreat Detection System for IoT networks that leverages Digital Twin technology and an optimized Federated Learning approach. Our hypothesis implies integrating Digital Twin models within an IoT security framework to improve real-time cyberthreat detection capabilities. We implement a 'Adaptive Thresholding with Early Stopping method' based methodology in Federated Learning to systematically train and aggregate local models based on predefined training rounds, thereby ensuring that all local models contribute to the global model until a target accuracy is achieved. This method significantly improves the detection of zero-day attacks by reducing dependency on random selections and partial data. The system architecture features Digital Twins of IoT medical infrastructure components-such as radiology, intensive care, and outpatient care-positioned at the network edge to minimize latency and bandwidth usage. Comparative evaluations of our model against traditional federated averaging methods demonstrate superior performance, with enhancements in model aggregation efficiency evidenced by higher F1 scores and reduced CPU usage. Specifically, our distributed digital twin environment at the edge layer shows 14% and 33% latency reductions compared to fog and cloud-based implementations, respectively. This study highlights the potential of Digital Twin and advanced Federated Learning methodologies to secure IoT networks against evolving and growing cyber threats.

TI  - Advancing Spectrum Anomaly Detection through Digital Twins
T2  - IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
M3  - Article
AB  - 6th generation (6G) cellular networks are expected to enable various safety-critical use cases, for example, in the industrial domain, which require flawless operation of the network. Thus, resilience is one of the key requirements for 6G. A particularly critical point is that 6G, as any other wireless technology, is based on the open radio medium, making it susceptible to interference. Especially intentional interference, that is, jamming, can severely degrade the network operability. Therefore, a new approach for detecting anomalies in the radio spectrum using a digital twin (DT) of the radio environment is presented in this work. This allows the integration of contextual awareness in the anomaly detection process and is thereby superior to state-of-the-art methods for spectrum anomaly detection. We propose a suitable system architecture and discuss the tasks of machine learning (ML) therein, particularly for reducing the computational complexity, and to detect anomalies in an unsupervised manner. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by ray tracing simulations. The results indicate a strong detection capability in case of an accurate DT and thereby illustrate the potential of DTs to enhance monitoring of wireless networks in the future.

AB  - Quality and efficiency of the work environment are essential to the well-being, health and productivity of employees. Despite the increasing focus on these aspects, many workplaces currently do not fully meet the needs and expectations of employees, with negative consequences for their well-being and productivity. The research aims to develop a system based on the Smart Building and Digital Twin paradigm, focusing on the implementation of various IoT components, the creation of automation flows for energy-efficient lighting, HVAC and indoor air quality control systems, and decision support through real-time data visualization enabled by user interfaces and dashboards integrating the geometric and information model (BIM). The system also aims to provide a tool for both monitoring and simulation/planning/decision support through the processing and development of machine learning (ML) algorithms. In relation to emergency management, real-time data can be acquired, allowing information to be shared with users and building managers through the creation of dashboards and visual analysis. After defining the functional requirements and identifying all3 the monitorable quantities that can be translated into requirements, the system architecture is described, the implementation of the case study is illustrated and the preliminary results of the first data collection campaign and initial estimates of future forecasts are shown.

TI  - Actionable cognitive twins for decision making in manufacturing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Actionable Cognitive Twins are the next generation Digital Twins enhanced with cognitive capabilities through a knowledge graph and artificial intelligence models that provide insights and decision-making options to the users. The knowledge graph describes the domain-specific knowledge regarding entities and interrelationships related to a manufacturing setting. It also contains information on possible decision-making options that can assist decision-makers, such as planners or logisticians. This paper proposes a knowledge graph modelling approach to construct actionable cognitive twins for capturing specific knowledge related to production planning and demand forecasting in a manufacturing plant. The knowledge graph provides semantic descriptions and contextualisation of the production lines and processes, including data identification and simulation or artificial intelligence algorithms and forecasts used to support them. Such semantics provide ground for inferencing, relating different knowledge types: creative, deductive, definitional, and inductive. To develop the knowledge graph models for describing the use case thoroughly, systems thinking approach is proposed to design and verify the ontology, develop a knowledge graph and build an actionable cognitive twin. Finally, we evaluate our approach in two use cases developed for a European original equipment manufacturer related to the automotive industry as part of the European Horizon 2020 project FACTLOG.

TI  - Reference architecture design and evaluation for digitalization of underground mining
T2  - INTERNET OF THINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Digitalization of underground mining operations requires interaction and interoperability between multiple stakeholders and their technical systems. A reference architecture (RA) facilitating design of multi-stakeholder digital solutions for underground mining would be valuable design knowledge for mining industry digitalization activities and would facilitate the design of concrete architectures to the underground mining context. The main contribution of this work is RA design, which is missing in the current research literature. The RA has empirical foundation on the implementation architectures of two prototypes, which were demonstrated and evaluated in an underground mining environment. The prototypes were evaluated based on several design science research evaluation criteria (feasibility, efficiency, robustness, operability) for fulfilling architectural concerns of related stakeholders. Digital Twin-based modeling, MQTT-based messaging, high accuracy location monitoring of vehicles with Lidars, reliable communication with 5G SA network, and utilization of safety zones and safety messaging for enabling emergency stops were identified as important aspects for RA design. Digital Twin (DT)-based data models focusing on the modeling of mining site, moving vehicles, communication data, and related equipment for the underground mining context may be considered as an additional contribution of our study.

AB  - Digital Twins (DTs) are becoming a reference design abstraction for many Internet of Things (IoT) application scenarios. Also, data processing is shifting to a decentralised setting leveraging the edge computing paradigm to move computation closer to the physical devices. In this context, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) technologies on 5G cellular networks are redefining the IoT networking infrastructure by enabling ultra low latency, and reliable and responsive connectivity. However, evaluation of the MEC architecture from the application developer standpoint is currently missing from literature, as well as an assessment of performance while adopting DT on top of MEC. Therefore, this paper reports on a MEC implementation based on OpenNESS toolkit, in the context of DT-based mobility, and an evaluation of its service-level performance.

TI  - Developing and Evolving a Digital Twin of the Organization
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital Twin of the Organization (DTO) is a relatively new concept that emerged to help managers have a full understanding of their organization and realize their objectives. Indeed, DTO enables connecting all the elements of an organization virtually by providing monitoring, optimization, prediction, and other capabilities through continuous simulations. Creating a flexible and evolvable DTO that covers and supports the organization's business strategies is a complex and time-consuming task that requires engineering best practices. In this context, this paper presents and evaluates the EA Blueprint Pattern, which serves as an architectural reference for the development of a DTO by allowing for mapping well-known Enterprise Architecture concepts into software components defining the DTO software architecture. The evaluation is carried on by showing how to use the pattern for creating the DTO for a given organization. Then, a thorough discussion is conducted to analyze how the developed DTO should evolve to deal with vertical and horizontal integration. The lessons learned highlight the strengths and weaknesses along with practical implications for organizations that are eager to develop their DTO according to the EA Blueprint Pattern.

TI  - A Fault Diagnosis Approach Utilizing Artificial Intelligence for Maritime Power Systems within an Integrated Digital Twin Framework
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This research focuses on enhancing the preventive maintenance strategies currently employed for induction motors within ship propulsion systems, advocating for a shift towards a predictive maintenance model. It introduces a real-time monitoring framework that continuously observes the induction motor, providing essential support to maintenance personnel. The motor operates under a range of environmental and operational conditions, including temperature fluctuations, rotational speeds, and mechanical loads. These variations can obscure the current time series data, potentially masking signs of actual damage and hindering effective damage detection. To tackle this issue, the proposed framework utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) technology, specifically the well-established autoencoder, in conjunction with the Mahalanobis statistical distance. This approach accounts for the diverse operating conditions during the training phase, allowing it to model complex, non-linear relationships and effectively differentiate between normal and anomalous states. The framework is integrated into a decision support platform designed for real-time operations in maritime settings, offering a sophisticated system architecture that aims to align advanced damage detection methodologies with the maritime industry's need for real-time, user-friendly solutions.

AB  - In augmented reality (AR) applications, the real world can interact with the virtual world through image processing and overlay. This concept is increasingly being utilized in various Industry 4.0 applications, such as mobile robotics, the Internet of Things, computer vision, and more. This article presents the development of an augmented reality (AR)-based digital twin system with a focus on its educational significance. The developed system enables simulation, interaction, and real-time visualization of the trajectory of an autonomous mobile robot, using sensor fusion with the Kalman filter. By integrating AR with the robot's odometry, the system enhances the accuracy of robot localization, providing an immersive and interactive learning experience. Leveraging AR software development kits like Unity and Vuforia facilitated the creation of a modular application that can be used in conjunction with a mobile robot. The effectiveness of the developed system is demonstrated by delivering enhanced reliability and precision in estimating the robot's trajectory, thereby contributing to a better understanding of autonomous locomotion principles. Furthermore, the article discusses the educational applications and ongoing improvements of the platform, exploring the potential of augmented reality as a powerful educational tool in the context of mobile robotics.

TI  - The Metaverse Is Geospatial: A System Model Architecture Integrating Spatial Computing, Digital Twins, and Virtual Worlds
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Virtual geographic environments long simulated real-world scenarios in urban planning, monument preservation, city infrastructure management, education, and entertainment. Their web-based visualisation and distribution made these environments widely accessible. However, many systems remain static, lacking real-time data integration and multi-user collaboration, while virtual worlds designed for the Metaverse emphasise dynamic interaction yet often omit essential geospatial context. Bridging this gap is critical for advancing virtual geographic environments into the next generation. In this paper, we present a modular system architecture for applications demonstrating geospatial virtual worlds over the web. Our goal is to provide a generic, well-structured framework that exposes the essential classes and interfaces needed for building 3D virtual worlds with geospatial data at their core. Our work focuses on defining specific geospatial components, methods, classes, and interfaces that form the foundation of a modern geospatial virtual environment in the Metaverse era. The proposed architecture is organised into three layers: access, world, and integration, which together enable accurate mapping and integration of real-time sensor data, digital twin synchronisation, and support for location-based services. Our analysis reveals that while most current solutions excel in either multi-user interaction or geospatial data management, they rarely combine both. In contrast, our model delivers enhanced geospatial focus, real-time collaboration, and interoperability between physical and digital realms. Overall, this work lays a solid foundation for future innovations in creating immersive, interactive, and geospatially grounded virtual experiences over the web, marking an important step in the evolution of virtual geographic environments for the Metaverse era.

TI  - Creating the foundation for digital twins in the manufacturing industry: an integrated installed base management system
T2  - INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND E-BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Services play an important role in the manufacturing industry. A shift in emphasis from selling physical products to offering product-service systems is perceived. Detailed knowledge of machines, components and subcomponents in whole plants must be provided. Installed base management contributes to this and enables services in manufacturing to maintain high machine availability and reduce downtimes. Installed base management assists in data structuring and management. By combining installed base data with sensor data, a digital twin of the installed base results. Following the action design research approach, an integrated installed base management system for manufacturing is presented and implemented in practice. An engineering and manufacturing company is involved in the research process and ensures practical relevance. Requirements are not only deduced from the literature but also identified in focus group discussions. A detailed test run with real data is performed for evaluation purpose using a demonstration machine. To enable a generalization, design principles for the development and implementation of such an integrated installed base management system are created.

TI  - Adaptive digital twins for energy-intensive industries and their local communities
T2  - DIGITAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital Twins (DTs) are high-fidelity virtual models that behave-like, look-like and connect-to a physical system. In this work, the physical systems are operations and processes from energy-intensive industrial plants and their local communities. The creation of DTs demands expertise not just in engineering, but also in computer science, data science, and artificial intelligence. Here, we introduce the Adaptive Digital Twins (ADT) concept, anchored in five attributes inspired by the self-adaptive systems field from software engineering. These attributes are selflearning, self-optimizing, self-evolving, self-monitoring, and self-protection. This new approach merges cuttingedge computing with pragmatic engineering needs. ADTs can enhance decision-making in both the design phase and real-time operation of industrial facilities and allow for versatile 'what-if' scenario simulations. Seven applications within the energy-intensive industries are described where ADTs could be transformative.

TI  - Integration of ROS and Tecnomatix for the development of digital twins based decision-making systems for smart factories
T2  - IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital twins employs simulation in conjunction with virtual environments and a variety of data coming from different plant equipment and physical systems to continuously update the digital models of the world in a feedback loop scheme to facilitate the decision-making processes. The heterogeneity of existing hardware and software requires the development of software architectures able to deal with the information exchange due to the integration and interaction of several system components and autonomous decision-making systems. In this work we propose the design and construction of a software architecture that integrates a manufacturing process simulator with the well-known robot operating system (ROS-Robot Operating System) to easily interchange information with an autonomous decision-making system. The proposal is tested with the simulator Tecnomatix and the free distribution ROS Melodic. We present an instance of software architecture for a typical complex case study of manufacturing plants and demonstrate its easy integration with an autonomous decision-making system based on the reinforcement- learning paradigm.

AB  - Chaos Engineering represents an interesting software engineering methodology to improve the resilience of a complex IT system operating in a live production environment by injecting simulated faults, observing the system reaction, and devising mitigating solutions. However, Chaos Engineering is an expensive practice with a high setup and operation overhead and it often focuses on the evaluation of the system behavior from a relatively narrow technical perspective instead of a more comprehensive business level one. To enlarge the audience of Chaos Engineering there is the need for novel solutions that can give service providers the tools to deal with the deployment and testing of complex IT services. To fill this gap, this paper presents ChaosTwin, a novel solution exploring an innovative approach to apply Chaos Engineering to a digital-twin, i.e., a virtual representation of a physical object or a system. By creating realistic digital twin of an IT service, injecting faults on the digital twin and evaluating how different service configuration and fault management strategies would perform from a business level perspective, ChaosTwin provides useful guidance to service providers in finding cost-effective service configurations that can minimize the negative effects of unpredictable events. Experimental results, collected from the evaluation of a realistic case study, demonstrate how ChaosTwin is capable of minimizing both the associated costs and the effects of injected Chaos faults.

TI  - Digital twin of electric vehicle battery systems: Comprehensive review of the use cases, requirements, and platforms
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Transportation electrification has been fueled by recent advancements in the technology and manufacturing of battery systems, but the industry yet is facing serious challenges that could be addressed using cutting-edge digital technologies. One such novel technology is based on the digital twining of battery systems. Digital twins (DTs) of batteries utilize advanced multi-layer models, artificial intelligence, advanced sensing units, Internet-of-Things technologies, and cloud computing techniques to provide a virtual live representation of the real battery system (the physical twin) to improve the performance, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, they orchestrate the operation of the entire battery value chain offering great advantages, such as improving the economy of manufacturing, re-purposing, and recycling processes. In this context, various studies have been carried out discussing the DT applications and use cases from cloud-enabled battery management systems to the digitalization of battery testing. This work provides a comprehensive review of different possible use cases, key enabling technologies, and requirements for battery DTs. The review inclusively discusses the use cases, development/integration platforms, as well as hardware and software requirements for implementation of the battery DTs, including electrical topics related to the modeling and algorithmic approaches, software architec-tures, and digital platforms for DT development and integration. The existing challenges are identified and circumstances that will create enough value to justify these challenges, such as the added costs, are discussed.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 10th International Operational Modal Analysis Conference (IOMAC)

AB  - The management of aging built infrastructure represents one of the most pressing challenges facing most developed countries. The circumstance that a sizable portion of the world's infrastructure, mostly made of reinforced concrete, is approaching its design life-expectancy of 50-100 years, poses a serious risk of cascade failures with severe socioeconomic consequences. This has led to the growing implementation of new maintenance regulations, in which Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) plays predominant role as an effective means of preventive maintenance. Nonetheless, the extensive implementation of SHM systems still encounters serious difficulties, both from hardware and software standpoints. Clear evidence of the latter is the current lack of widely accepted software programs capable of managing dense sensor networks on a regional scale. Indeed, most innovations in the realm of SHM remain confined to research environments without a clear transition to engineering routine practice. In this context, this work presents the latest advances in the development of a comprehensive SHM software platform called MOVA/MOSS. Originally designed as a software framework for conducting long-term integrated SHM of structures (encompassing both dynamic and static monitoring), the most recent upgrades involve the incorporation of digital twins and artificial intelligence for real-time system and damage identification. The potential of the developed software platform is showcased through several real-world structures, with particular focus on the integration possibilities of non-supervised (data-driven) and supervised (model-driven) damage identification.

TI  - An Immersive Hydroinformatics Framework with Extended Reality for Enhanced Visualization and Simulation of Hydrologic Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study introduces a novel framework with the use of extended reality (XR) systems in hydrology, particularly focusing on immersive visualization of hydrologic data for enhanced environmental planning and decision making. The study details the shift from traditional 2D data visualization methods in hydrology to more advanced XR technologies, including virtual and augmented reality. Unlike static 2D maps or charts that require cross-referencing disparate data sources, this system consolidates real-time, multivariate datasets, such as streamflow, precipitation, and terrain, into a single interactive, spatially contextualized 3D environment. Immersive information systems facilitate dynamic interaction with real-time hydrological and meteorological datasets for various stakeholders and use cases, and pave the way for metaverse and digital twin systems. This system, accessible via web browsers and XR devices, allows users to navigate a 3D representation of the continental United States. The paper addresses the current limitations in hydrological visualization, methodology, and system architecture while discussing the challenges, limitations, and future directions to extend its applicability to a wider range of environmental management and disaster response scenarios. Future application potential includes climate resilience planning, immersive disaster preparedness training, and public education, where stakeholders can explore scenario-based outcomes within a virtual space to support real-time or anticipatory decision making.

AB  - The highly dynamic and confrontational nature of the future battlefield environment places higher demands on the resilience of systems, and requires a shift in mission understanding from "manual understanding of mission changes and control based on predefined scenarios" to "autonomous understanding of mission changes and agile reconfiguration". In response to the difficulties that exist in the construction of integrated electronic information systems, such as the difficulty of constructing a multi-dimensional battlefield environment, the high consumption of real-world testing, the long equipment validation cycle, and the low timeliness of technical testing, a flexible and evolvable integrated electronic information twin system architecture design method is proposed. The aim is to provide a powerful support for the iterative optimization of combat systems in the virtual-real symbiotic environment, the detailed testing of combat solutions, the assessment of combat effectiveness equivalence, and the synchronization of key technologies.

TI  - Collaborative Clustering Parallel Reinforcement Learning for Edge-Cloud Digital Twins Manufacturing System
T2  - CHINA COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - To realize high-accuracy physical-cyber digital twin (DT) mapping in a manufacturing system, a huge amount of data need to be collected and analyzed in real-time. Traditional DTs systems are deployed in cloud or edge servers independently, whilst it is hard to apply in real production systems due to the high interaction or execution delay. This results in a low consistency in the temporal dimension of the physical-cyber model. In this work, we propose a novel efficient edge-cloud DT manufacturing system, which is inspired by resource scheduling technology. Specifically, an edge-cloud collaborative DTs system deployment architecture is first constructed. Then, deterministic and uncertainty optimization adaptive strategies are presented to choose a more powerful server for running DT-based applications. We model the adaptive optimization problems as dynamic programming problems and propose a novel collaborative clustering parallel Q-learning (CCPQL) algorithm and prediction-based CCPQL to solve the problems. The proposed approach reduces the total delay with a higher convergence rate. Numerical simulation results are provided to validate the approach, which would have great potential in dynamic and complex industrial internet environments.

TI  - Digital Twin Based on Historical Data and Simulation Results: Fault Detection and Estimation of the Remaining Useful Life of a Cyclone Bag Filter
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured Application Monitoring and fault identification applied to filtering devices for industrial milling plants. This study deals with the development of a digital twin for monitoring the operating conditions of a cyclone bag filter installed on the suction system of a wheat mill. The model aims to be used for fault identification and real-time prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL). Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed to characterize in detail the fluid-dynamic behavior of the airflow inside the system under different conditions of filter sleeve clogging. Furthermore, the simulation results were used to identify a location for the installation of a new velocity sensor that would allow, together with the pressure drop measured at the ends of the filter, monitoring of the systems' conditions. A model able to assess the filter's operating state, identify failure events or operating anomalies, and make a prediction of the RUL was then developed. A possible implementation of the developed model, based on the simulation results that aimed to optimize the management of the sleeve cleaning cycles was also proposed. The developed digital model was then tested on a working cycle lasting one year, in which a sleeve failure was simulated. It was shown how the simultaneous monitoring of the two identified quantities allows for the correct identification of the failure and the accurate prediction of the RUL.

AB  - System-level testing of healthcare Internet of Things (IoT) applications requires creating a test infrastructure with integrated medical devices and third-party applications. A significant challenge in creating such test infrastructure is that healthcare IoT applications evolve continuously with the addition of new medical devices from different vendors and new services offered by different third-party organizations following different architectures. Moreover, creating test infrastructure with a large number of different types of medical devices is time-consuming, financially expensive, and practically infeasible. Oslo City's healthcare department faced these challenges while working with various healthcare IoT applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a real-world test infrastructure software architecture (HITA) designed for healthcare IoT applications. We evaluated HITA's digital twin (DT) generation component implemented using model-based and machine learning (ML) approaches in terms of DT fidelity, scalability, and time cost of generating DTs. Results show that the fidelity of DTs created using model-based and ML approaches reach 94% and 95%, respectively. Results from operating 100 DTs concurrently show that the DT generation component is scalable and ML-based DTs have a higher time cost.

M3  - Article
AB  - Featured ApplicationPerimeter security of stationary aircraft on a landing strip; autonomous vehicle navigation with dynamic obstacles.Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) has made significant strides in the last decade and is now beginning to increase coverage of the system life cycle and in the process generating many more digital artifacts. The MBSE community today recognizes the need for a flexible framework to efficiently organize, access, and manage MBSE artifacts; create and use digital twins for verification and validation; facilitate comparative evaluation of system models and algorithms; and assess system performance. This paper presents progress to date in developing a MBSE experimentation testbed that addresses these requirements. The current testbed comprises several components, including a scenario builder, a smart dashboard, a repository of system models and scenarios, connectors, optimization and learning algorithms, and simulation engines, all connected to a private cloud. The testbed has been successfully employed in developing an aircraft perimeter security system and an adaptive planning and decision-making system for autonomous vehicles. The testbed supports experimentation with simulated and physical sensors and with digital twins for verifying system behavior. A simulation-driven smart dashboard is used to visualize and conduct comparative evaluation of autonomous and human-in-the-loop control concepts and architectures. Key findings and lessons learned are presented along with a discussion of future directions.

TI  - Proof of Evaluation-based energy and delay aware computation offloading for Digital Twin Edge Network
T2  - AD HOC NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability of Internet of Things (IoT) applications has led to the development of new technologies. Specifically, the deployment of edge servers close to IoT devices has strengthened the edge computing paradigm. With the collaboration of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and cloud computing, delay-sensitive and computation-intensive tasks can be offloaded to the edge/cloud servers to improve system performance in terms of the delay and energy consumption of IoT devices. However, there is a need to schedule the computation tasks for an efficient management. More importantly, the task scheduling strategy can face data tampering attacks to deliberately modify, destroy or manipulate the decisions. To solve the above problems, in this paper, we newly propose to integrate digital twin and blockchain into the edge networks. However, it is unclear (i) how energy and delay-aware computation should be combined, and (ii) which mining computations should be executed for a secure task scheduling. The state-of-the-art focuses on task scheduling and blockchain mining, separately. Therefore, we propose a novel blockchain-based digital twin-edge network architecture where our proposed algorithm solves these two challenges at the same execution. We design a three-layer system architecture, composed of physical entity layer, digital twin edge layer and blockchain layer. In the physical entity layer, we formulate an energy and delay-aware task scheduling problem. In the digital twin edge layer, we propose a novel Proof of Evaluation (PoE)-based secure energy and delay-aware task scheduling algorithm where optimization is executed by the genetic algorithm implementation of Warehouse Location Problem (WLP). In the blockchain layer, the best-found solutions are shared with the topology in a blockchain. Here, each block includes the hash of the previous block, a genetic algorithm-based solution, nonce value, and a hash of whole blocks in the blockchain. Thus, we aim to execute the computation tasks with an acceptable delay in an energy-efficient manner and prevent data tampering attacks against the optimal computation decisions. We validate the outcomes of our PoE-based secure digital twin-edge network model with extensive evaluations. Since the proposed model distributes the task not only to the local device but also to the MEC and cloud server for delay awareness, it reduces the delay but consumes more energy. Nevertheless, the additional energy consumption can be neglected against the delay reduction. The proposed scheme is also more scalable to compare with the conventional solution. The numerical results clearly show that the proposed model provides energy and delay awareness, maintaining both data integrity and trustworthiness at the same execution of algorithm.

TI  - Interoperable Data Analytics Reference Architectures Empowering Digital-Twin-Aided Manufacturing
T2  - FUTURE INTERNET
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of mature, reliable, and validated solutions can save significant time and cost when introducing new technologies to companies. Reference Architectures represent such best-practice techniques and have the potential to increase the speed and reliability of the development process in many application domains. One area where Reference Architectures are increasingly utilized is cloud-based systems. Exploiting the high-performance computing capability offered by clouds, while keeping sovereignty and governance of proprietary information assets can be challenging. This paper explores how Reference Architectures can be applied to overcome this challenge when developing cloud-based applications. The presented approach was developed within the DIGIT-brain European project, which aims at supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and mid-caps in realizing smart business models called Manufacturing as a Service, via the efficient utilization of Digital Twins. In this paper, an overview of Reference Architecture concepts, as well as their classification, specialization, and particular application possibilities are presented. Various data management and potentially spatially detached data processing configurations are discussed, with special attention to machine learning techniques, which are of high interest within various sectors, including manufacturing. A framework that enables the deployment and orchestration of such overall data analytics Reference Architectures in clouds resources is also presented, followed by a demonstrative application example where the applicability of the introduced techniques and solutions are showcased in practice.

AB  - Different kind of smart healthcare ecosystems have been adopted in the last few years usually based on the continuous monitoring of people as well as other physical entities such as buildings or devices. The diverse nature and origins of the great amount of data that those novel smart healthcare ecosystems must process poses additional data management issues that restrict and difficult their design and construction. In order to improve data management in smart healthcare ecosystems, a data fabric architecture-like process for data lifecycle management has been obtained from the analysis of different architectural proposals intended for being used for different types of systems and contexts. This process integrates aspects of Digital Twins (DT) to tackle with the data contextualization problems that characterizes data fabric architectures. Based on the proposed approach, a prototype of a novel smart healthcare Internet of Things (IoT)-based ecosystem to prevent the spreading of the virus in a real Spanish nursing home has been developed. The evaluation of the prototype has been carried out following a specific novel IoT-based systems evaluation methodology combined with ISO software quality standards that determined that the system is reliable and efficient in performance.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel telemanipulation system that enables a human operator to control a dual-arm robot. The operation provides kinesthetic teaching via a digital twin of the robot which the operator cyber-physically guides to perform a task. Its key enabler is the concept of a virtual reality interactive marker, which serves as a simplified end effector of the digital twin robot. In virtual reality, the operator can interact with the marker using bare hands, which are sensed by the Leap Motion on top of a virtual reality headset. Then, the status (e.g. position/orientation) of the marker is transformed to the corresponding joint space command to the remote robot so that its end effector can follow the marker. We provide the details of the system architecture, and implement the system based on commercial robots/devices (i.e. UR5, Robotiq gripper, Leap Motion), virtual reality, ROS, and Unity3D. Moreover, the paper discusses the technical challenges that we had to address, and the system's potential benefits from a human-robot interaction perspective.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital Twins (DTs) hold promise for the effective implementation of predictive maintenance (PdM) in constructed facilities. However, their adoption in the AECO industry is lagging due to the low level of knowledge on their design and implementation, influenced by the lack of realworld exemplars. This paper presents two real-world BIM-based DTs for PdM in an existing building, detailing the methodology for their design and implementation. The two DT designs cover sensor data integration from legacy systems with digital models of the facility and the programming of analytics for PdM as well as data modeling for representing the physical objects in the digital model. In addition, the paper evaluates the two DT solutions and provides key considerations to make when deciding whether to build or buy. Overall, the study makes contributions towards criteria for DT platform selection, "build versus buy" comparisons, system architecture design, and end-user feedback on DT user interactions and task-dependent performance.

CP  - Physiome Symposium on Integrated Biology of the Heart
CL  - SEATTLE, WASHINGTON
AB  - The physiome is the quantitative description of the functioning organism in normal and pathophysiological states. The human physiome can be regarded as the virtual human. It is built upon the morpheme,the quantitative description of anatomical structure, chemical and biochemical composition, and material properties of an intact organism, including its genome, proteome, cell, tissue, and organ structures up to those of the whole intact being. The Physiome Project is a multicentric integrated program to design, develop, implement, test and document, archive and disseminate quantitative information, and integrative models of the functional behavior of molecules, organelles, cells, tissues, organs, and intact organisms from bacteria to man. A fundamental and major feature of the project is the databasing of experimental observations for retrieval and evaluation. Technologies allowing many groups to work together are being rapidly developed. Internet II will facilitate this immensely. When problems are huge and complex, a particular working group can be expert in only a small part of the overall project. The strategies to be worked out must therefore include how to pull models composed of many submodules together even when the expertise in each is scattered amongst diverse institutions. The technologies of bioinformatics will contribute greatly to this effort. Developing and implementing code for large-scale systems has many problems. Most of the submodules are complex, requiring consideration of spatial and temporal events and processes. Submodules have to be linked to one another in a way that preserves mass balance and gives an accurate representation of variables in nonlinear complex biochemical networks with many signaling and controlling pathways. Microcompartmentalization vitiates the use of simplified model structures. The stiffness of the systems of equations is computationally costly. Faster computation is needed when using models as thinking tools and for iterative data analysis. Perhaps the most serious problem is the current lack of definitive information on kinetics and dynamics of systems, due in part to the almost total lack of databased observations, but also because, though we are nearly drowning in new information being published each day, either the information required for the modeling cannot be found or has never been obtained. "Simple" things like tissue composition, material properties, and mechanical behavior of cells and tissues are not generally available. The development of comprehensive models of biological systems is a key to pharmaceutics and drug design, for the models will become gradually better predictors of the results of interventions, both genomic and pharmaceutic. Good models will be useful in predicting the side effects and long term effects of drugs and toxins, and when the models are really good, to predict where genomic intervention will be effective and where the multiple redundancies in our biological systems will render a proposed intervention useless. The Physiome Project will provide the integrating scientific basis for the Genes to Health initiative, and make physiological genomics a reality applicable to whole organisms, from bacteria to man.

AB  - The emerging dynamic architectures of autonomous digital ecosystems raise new challenges in the process of assuring trust and safety. In particular, the admission of software smart agents into autonomous dynamic ecosystems will become a significant future topic. In this work we propose the concept of predictive simulation, which elevates from the concept of virtual Hardware-in-the-Loop (vHiL) testbed, to support rapid runtime evaluation of software smart agents in autonomous digital ecosystems. Based on this testbed, we introduce a novel strategy for building trust in software components that enter an ecosystem as black boxes without executing their behavior which can be potentially malicious, but by executing corresponding digital twins which are abstract models fed with real-time data.

AB  - To accurately and effectively analyze electroencephalogram (EEG) with high complexity, large amount of data, and strong uncertainty, brain-computer interface (BCI) cognitive computing and its signal analysis algorithms are studied based on the digital twins (DTs) cognitive computing platform. To avoid the influence of noise on EEG analysis results, it is necessary to use filtering and defalsification methods to process EEG. Four methods, including Butterworth filter, finite impulse response (FIR) filter, elliptic filter, and wavelet decomposition, are summarized. Based on the Riemann manifold theory, a feature extraction algorithm under transfer learning based on tangent space selection (TL-TSS) is proposed. In the process of decoding EEG, an EEG decoding method combining entropy measure and singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is proposed. An algorithm performance is tested on the motor imagery dataset of the two International BCI Competitions. It is found that when the training sample size accounts for 5%, the TL-TSS algorithm proposed in this work is superior to other algorithms in classification accuracy. In particular, compared with common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm, it has great advantages. The classification accuracy of A2, A4, A8, and A9 users is the best, and especially for A8 users, the classification accuracy reaches 97.88%. In summary, in the EEG interface technology of DT cognitive computing platform, the combination of cognitive computing and deep learning can improve the recognition and analysis effect of EEG, which is of great value for further optimization of DT cognitive computing system.

TI  - Uncertainty quantification and software risk analysis for digital twins in the nearly autonomous management and control systems: A review
T2  - ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - A nearly autonomous management and control (NAMAC) system is designed to furnish recommendations to operators for achieving particular goals based on NAMAC's knowledge base. As a critical component in a NAMAC system, digital twins (DTs) are used to extract information from the knowledge base to support decision-making in reactor control and management during all modes of plant operations. With the advancement of artificial intelligence and data-driven methods, machine learning algorithms are used to build DTs of various functions in the NAMAC system. To evaluate the uncertainty of DTs and its impacts on the reactor digital instrumentation and control systems, uncertainty quantification (UQ) and software risk analysis is needed. As a comprehensive overview of prior research and a starting point for new investigations, this study selects and reviews relevant UQ techniques and software hazard and software risk analysis methods that may be suitable for DTs in the NAMAC system.

TI  - Full modelling of the MOSAIC animal PET system based on the GATE Monte Carlo simulation code
T2  - PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Positron emission tomography ( PET) systems dedicated to animal imaging are now widely used for biological studies. The scanner performance strongly depends on the design and the characteristics of the system. Many parameters must be optimized like the dimensions and type of crystals, geometry and field- of- view ( FOV), sampling, electronics, lightguide, shielding, etc. Monte Carlo modelling is a powerful tool to study the effect of each of these parameters on the basis of realistic simulated data. Performance assessment in terms of spatial resolution, count rates, scatter fraction and sensitivity is an important prerequisite before the model can be used instead of real data for a reliable description of the system response function or for optimization of reconstruction algorithms. The aim of this study is to model the performance of the Philips Mosaic (TM) animal PET system using a comprehensive PET simulation code in order to understand and describe the origin of important factors that influence image quality. We use GATE, a Monte Carlo simulation toolkit for a realistic description of the ring PETmodel, the detectors, shielding, cap, electronic processing and dead times. We incorporate new features to adjust signal processing to the Anger logic underlying the Mosaic (TM) system. Special attention was paid to dead time and energy spectra descriptions. Sorting of simulated events in a list mode format similar to the system outputs was developed to compare experimental and simulated sensitivity and scatter fractions for different energy thresholds using various models of phantoms describing rat and mouse geometries. Count rates were compared for both cylindrical homogeneous phantoms. Simulated spatial resolution was fitted to experimental data for F-18 point sources at different locations within the FOV with an analytical blurring function for electronic processing effects. Simulated and measured sensitivities differed by less than 3%, while scatter fractions agreed within 9%. For a 410 - 665 keV energy window, the measured sensitivity for a centred point source was 1.53% and mouse and rat scatter fractions were respectively 12.0% and 18.3%. The scattered photons produced outside the rat and mouse phantoms contributed to 24% and 36% of total simulated scattered coincidences. Simulated and measured single and prompt count rates agreed well for activities up to the electronic saturation at 110 MBq for the mouse and rat phantoms. Volumetric spatial resolution was 17.6 mu L at the centre of the FOV with differences less than 6% between experimental and simulated spatial resolution values. The comprehensive evaluation of the Monte Carlo modelling of the Mosaic (TM) system demonstrates that the GATE package is adequately versatile and appropriate to accurately describe the response of an Anger logic based animal PET system.

TI  - Petascale Cloud Supercomputing for Terapixel Visualization of a Digital Twin
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CLOUD COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background-Photo-realistic terapixel visualization is computationally intensive and to date there have been no such visualizations of urban digital twins, the few terapixel visualizations that exist have looked towards space rather than earth. Objective-Our aims are: creating a scalable cloud supercomputer software architecture for visualization; a photo-realistic terapixel 3D visualization of urban IoT data supporting daily updates; a rigorous evaluation of cloud supercomputing for our application. Method-We migrated the Blender Cycles path tracer to the public cloud within a new software framework designed to scale to petaFLOP performance. Results-We demonstrate that we can compute a terapixel visualization in under one hour, the system scaling at 98 percent efficiency to use 1024 public cloud GPU nodes delivering 14 petaFLOPS. The resulting terapixel image supports interactive browsing of the city and its data at a wide range of sensing scales. Conclusion-The GPU compute resource available in the cloud is greater than anything available on our national supercomputers providing access to the globally competitive resources. The direct financial cost of access, compared to procuring and running these systems, was low. The indirect cost, in overcoming teething issues with cloud software development, should reduce significantly over time.

TI  - Towards hydrogen-powered electric aircraft: Physics-informed machine learning based multi-domain modeling and real-time digital twin emulation on FPGA
T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to environmental concerns related to carbon and nitrogen emissions, hydrogen-powered aircraft (HPA) are poised for significant development over the coming decades, driven by advances in power electronics technology. However, HPA systems present complex multi-domain challenges encompassing electrical, hydraulic, mechanical, and chemical disciplines, necessitating efficient modeling and robust validation platforms. This paper introduces a physics-informed machine learning (PIML) approach for multi-domain HPA system modeling, enhanced by hardware accelerated parallel hardware emulation to construct a real-time digital twin. It delves into the physical analysis of various HPA subsystems, whose equations form the basis for both traditional numerical solution methods like Euler's and Runge-Kutta methods (RKM), as well as the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) components developed herein. By comparing physics-feature neural networks (PFNN) and PINN with conventional neural network strategies, this paper elucidates their advantages and limitations in practical applications. The final implementation on the Xilinx (R) UltraScale+TM VCU128 FPGA platform showcases the PIML method's high efficiency, accuracy, data independence, and adherence to established physical laws, demonstrating its potential for advancing real-time multi-domain HPA emulation.

TI  - Virtual Infrastructure Twin for Computing-Instrument Ecosystems: Software and Measurements
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced science workflows are orchestrated over complex ecosystems consisting of computing platforms and physical instruments connected over wide-area networks. The availability of physical facilities of these ecosystems may be limited during typically long software development periods, due to the expense, disruption risk and limited readiness during the design and construction stages. We present a Virtual Infrastructure Twin (VIT) of such an ecosystem to support the software development and testing for multi-site computing-instrument ecosystems. A VIT is implemented using virtual hosts connected over emulated local-area networks at sites, which are in turn connected over an emulated wide-area network. We describe the design and implementation details of a VIT including: (i) host and network emulations and the incorporation of instrument simulators, (ii) services for remote instrument steering, and (iii) performance analytics based on network throughput and disk input/output measurements. We illustrate a use case by emulating an ecosystem of four geographically distributed laboratory sites with services for accessing and steering instruments and estimating throughput profiles using physical testbed measurements.

TI  - Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Modeling and Control of Dynamical Systems
T2  - 2023 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE, ACC
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - American Control Conference (ACC)
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is a set of methods and tools that systematically integrate machine learning (ML) algorithms with physical constraints and abstract mathematical models developed in scientific and engineering domains. As opposed to purely data-driven methods, PIML models can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing physical laws such as energy and mass conservation. More broadly, PIML models can include abstract properties and conditions such as stability, convexity, or invariance. The basic premise of PIML is that the integration of ML and physics can yield more effective, physically consistent, and data-efficient models. This paper aims to provide a tutorial-like overview of the recent advances in PIML for dynamical system modeling and control. Specifically, the paper covers an overview of the theory, fundamental concepts and methods, tools, and applications on topics of: 1) physics-informed learning for system identification; 2) physics-informed learning for control; 3) analysis and verification of PIML models; and 4) physics-informed digital twins. The paper is concluded with a perspective on open challenges and future research opportunities.

TI  - DTAIS: Distributed trusted active identity resolution systems for the Industrial Internet
T2  - DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the Industrial Internet and Industry 4.0 came into being. With the development of modern industrial intelligent manufacturing technology, digital twins, Web3 and many other digital entity applications are also proposed. These applications apply architectures such as distributed learning, resource sharing, and arithmetic trading, which make high demands on identity authentication, asset authentication, resource addressing, and service location. Therefore, an efficient, secure, and trustworthy Industrial Internet identity resolution system is needed. However, most of the traditional identity resolution systems follow DNS architecture or tree structure, which has the risk of a single point of failure and DDoS attack. And they cannot guarantee the security and privacy of digital identity, personal assets, and device information. So we consider a decentralized approach for identity management, identity authentication, and asset verification. In this paper, we propose a distributed trusted active identity resolution system based on the inter-planetary file system (IPFS) and nonfungible token (NFT), which can provide distributed identity resolution services. And we have designed the system architecture, identity service process, load balancing strategy and smart contract service. In addition, we use Jmeter to verify the performance of the system, and the results show that the system has good high concurrent performance and robustness.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Using data analytics to improve industrial planning and operations has become increasingly popular and data scientists are more and more in demand. However, complex data analytics-based software development is challenging. It involves many new roles lacking in traditional software engineering teams - e.g. data scientists and data engineers; use of sophisticated machine learning (ML) approaches replacing many programming tasks; uncertainty inherent in the models; as well as interfacing with models to fulfill software functionalities. These challenges make communication and collaboration within the team and with external stakeholders challenging. In this paper, we describe our experiences in applying our BiDaML (Big Data Analytics Modeling Languages) approach to several large-scale industrial projects. We used our BiDaML modeling toolset that brings all stakeholders around one tool to specify, model and document their big data applications. We report our experience in using and evaluating this tool on three real-world, large-scale applications with teams from: realas.com - a property price prediction website for home buyers; VicRoads - a project seeking to build a digital twin (simulated model) of Victoria's transport network updated in real-time by a stream of sensor data from inductive loop detectors at traffic intersections; and the Alfred Hospital - Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) prediction through Computed Tomography (CT) Scans. These show that our approach successfully supports complex data analytics software development in industrial settings.

TI  - Towards a Digital Twin of the Earth System: Geo-Soft-CoRe, a Geoscientific Software & Code Repository
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The immense advances in computer power achieved in the last decades have had a significant impact in Earth science, providing valuable research outputs that allow the simulation of complex natural processes and systems, and generating improved forecasts. The development and implementation of innovative geoscientific software is currently evolving towards a sustainable and efficient development by integrating models of different aspects of the Earth system. This will set the foundation for a future digital twin of the Earth. The codification and update of this software require great effort from research groups and therefore, it needs to be preserved for its reuse by future generations of geoscientists. Here, we report on Geo-Soft-CoRe, a Geoscientific Software & Code Repository, hosted at the archive DIGITAL.CSIC. This is an open source, multidisciplinary and multiscale collection of software and code developed to analyze different aspects of the Earth system, encompassing tools to: 1) analyze climate variability; 2) assess hazards, and 3) characterize the structure and dynamics of the solid Earth. Due to the broad range of applications of these software packages, this collection is useful not only for basic research in Earth science, but also for applied research and educational purposes, reducing the gap between the geosciences and the society. By providing each software and code with a permanent identifier (DOI), we ensure its self-sustainability and accomplish the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles. Therefore, we aim for a more transparent science, transferring knowledge in an easier way to the geoscience community, and encouraging an integrated use of computational infrastructure.

TI  - State space neural network with nonlinear physics for mechanical system modeling
T2  - RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamic modeling of mechanical systems is important for the monitoring, diagnostics, control, and prediction of system behaviors. Modeling dynamic systems is one of the emerging tasks in scientific machine learning. Neural networks have been used to learn surrogate models for the underlying dynamics in the form of data-driven neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs). While most dynamical mechanical systems have some degree of nonlinearity within their dynamics, neural networks have shown potential in approximating dynamic systems with nonlinearities. However, despite the universal approximation capability of neural networks, this paper argues that by adding physics-aware nonlinear functions to the neural network model, the modeling accuracy of the neural network can be increased. In this paper, the construction of the nonlinear continuous-time state-space neural network (NLCSNN) is presented. The proposed approach can be used as a data-driven method for digital twin construction for monitoring, prediction, and reliability assessment. The NLCSNN improves upon the previously established continuous-time state-space neural network by increasing sensitivity to nonlinearity. The proposed NLCSNN is trained and validated using numerical and experimental examples, with results compared against those from several existing methodologies. Validation results show that the NLCSNN model can learn complex engineering dynamics without explicit knowledge of the underlying system. The modeling performance of the proposed data-driven approach outperforms a purely physics-based model, with results comparable to hybrid models. Additionally, the NLCSNN model achieved higher accuracy than the continuous-time state-space neural network (CSNN) model.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - BuildSim Nordic Conference
CL  - Copenhagen, DENMARK
AB  - In this work, we present a micro-service architecture which defines a Digital Twin (DT) framework for adaptive building automation and control. The DT framework primarily involves the orchestration of several containerized micro -services, promoting the scalability and deployability of the proposed framework within the industrial context. In the proposed framework, containerized microservices facilitate: (i) model -based control strategies; (ii) data-driven learning; (iii) data management; (iv) the inclusion of an internal High -Fidelity Simulator (HFS) to enable bootstrapped learning; and (v) a User Interface/User Experience (UI/UE) micro -service orchestrator. To validate the usefulness of the proposed framework, we implement a Physics Inspired Neural Network (FINN) to adapt the model -based control strategies for plant-model uncertainty and utilize bootstrap sampling against an internal HFS.

T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulation has become a crucial tool for Building Energy Optimization (BEO) as it enables the evaluation of different design and control strategies at a low cost. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can leverage largescale simulations to learn optimal control from vast amounts of data without supervision, particularly under the Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm. Unfortunately, the lack of open and standardized tools has hindered the widespread application of ML and RL to BEO. To address this issue, this paper presents SINERGYM, an open- source Python-based virtual testbed for large-scale building simulation, data collection, continuous control, and experiment monitoring. SINERGYM provides a consistent interface for training and running controllers, predefined benchmarks, experiment visualization and replication support, and comprehensive documentation in a ready-to- use software library. This paper 1) highlights the main features of SINERGYM in comparison to other existing frameworks, 2) describes its basic usage, and 3) demonstrates its applicability for RL-based BEO through several representative examples. By integrating simulation, data, and control, SINERGYM supports the development of intelligent, data-driven applications for more efficient and responsive building operations, aligning with the objectives of digital twin technology.

TI  - BIM- and IoT-based virtual reality tool for real-time thermal comfort assessment in building enclosures
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite their vast potential for delivering rich and intuitive visualizations of live building monitoring data, digital twins have been rarely studied in the context of thermal comfort. To narrow this gap, this study investigates the synergistic benefits of Building Information Modeling (BIM), the Internet of Things (IoT) and Virtual Reality (VR) for developing an immersive VR application for real-time monitoring of thermal comfort conditions. A system architecture was proposed for live calculation of the PMV/PPD indices based on ASHRAE standard 55 and enrichment of BIM-based representations of building spaces in VR environments with live IoTenabled monitoring data. Openly available software tools were used to make the geometric and sensory data accessible within a VR application and calculate the PMV/PPD indices. Using a semi-automated method, raw thermal images streaming from a cost-effective non-intrusive sensor were processed on an affordable edge computing device to enable near real-time calculation of Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT). A prototype of the system was implemented and used in a series of experiments where a dynamic thermal environment was created in a mechanically conditioned space. The results support the consistency between the system's output and the actual thermal sensations observed under various conditions.

TI  - Uncertain Iterative Optimal Attitude Control Method for Periodic Satellite With Reliability Constraint
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - To realize the optimal attitude control for periodic satellites with bounded uncertainties, this study investigates an interval-based periodic linear quadratic regulator method subjected to reliability constraint. As one of the typical periodic satellites, the periodic dynamics of attitude control in space solar power station (SSPS) and its nominal state-space equation are constituted with the known period. To alleviate the cost of the control system for quantifying the probabilistic uncertainty, the uncertainty factors within the system are regarded as interval numbers based on set theory. An adaptive polynomial-based interval decoupling analysis method is introduced to accurately estimate the uncertainty boundaries of the state response and other control parameters. Considering the periodicity of the system, an interval-based periodic optimization control method based on discrete-time periodic algebraic Riccati matrix equations is proposed. The interval theory-based recursive formula of uncertain iterative optimal control and the convergence criterion are deduced and defined, respectively. The security state is evaluated by an interval theory-based time-varying reliability method, which will be considered as a constraint to constitute the uncertain optimization for attitude control. A numerical of the SSPS is applied to verify the proposed method.

TI  - Industrial IoT and Long Short-Term Memory Network-Enabled Genetic Indoor-Tracking for Factory Logistics
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Acquiring the real-time spatial-temporal information of manufacturing resources holds the promise to enable efficient operation in factory logistics. This article proposes a system architecture using industrial Internet of Things and digital twin technologies to fulfill spatial-temporal traceability and visibility with seamless cyber-physical synchronization for finished goods logistics in the workshop. A long short-term memory network-enabled genetic indoor-tracking algorithm (GITA) is developed to locate product trolleys via a bluetooth low energy technology, with ultra-wideband applied to sample labeling in the training stage. It is enlightened by genetics to achieve self-adapting online for the long-term performance. A feature selection method based on received signal strength indicator is designed to deal with signal multipath fading and streamline the learning process. In addition, the spatial-temporal information obtained is leveraged to activate location-based services that can help promote operational efficiency. Moreover, a real-life case study is carried out in a world-leading computer manufacturer's factory to illustrate the viability and practicality of the system and methods proposed, with hardware and software developed. By comparison, the GITA shows superiority over existing approaches despite various noises under the manufacturing scenario, attaining a location precision of about 2 m with a 98.12% accuracy.

TI  - EASEWASTE-life cycle modeling capabilities for waste management technologies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The management of municipal solid waste and the associated environmental impacts are subject of growing attention in industrialized countries. European Union has recently strongly emphasized the role of LCA in its waste and resource strategies. The development of sustainable solid waste management systems applying a life cycle perspective requires readily understandable tools for modeling the life cycle impacts of waste management systems. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate the structure, functionalities, and LCA modeling capabilities of the PC-based life cycle-oriented waste management model EASEWASTE, developed at the Technical University of Denmark specifically to meet the needs of the waste system developer with the objective to evaluate the environmental performance of the various elements of existing or proposed solid waste management systems.The EASEWASTE model supports a full life cycle assessment of any user-defined residential, bulky, or garden waste management system. The model focuses on the major components of the waste and reviews each component in terms of the available waste management options, including biogasification and composting, thermal treatment, use on land, material sorting and recycling, bottom and fly ash handling, material and energy utilization, and landfilling. In order to allow the use of the model in an early stage where local data may be limited, default data sets are provided for waste composition and quantities as well as for the waste technologies mentioned above. The model calculates environmental impacts and resource consumptions and allows the user to trace all impacts to their source in a waste treatment processes or in a specific waste material fraction. In addition to the traditional impact indicators, EASEWASTE incorporates impact categories on stored ecotoxicity, specifically developed for representation of the long-term impacts of persistent pollutants in landfilled waste. The model reports data at any stage of the LCA and supports identification of most sensitive parameters as well as overall sensitivity analysis and material balances for all substances passing through the system.The structure of the model is presented, and its functionalities are demonstrated on a hypothetical case study based on waste data from a large Danish municipality. The aim of the case is to demonstrate new waste treatment technologies and their modeling capabilities as well as the LCA modeling capabilities in EASEWASTE to identify the most important impact categories and the main sources of contributions to these in the system for treating the waste. Based on the results, the modeling features, user flexibility, and transparency of the EASEWASTE model are discussed.EASEWASTE is demonstrated to be a versatile and detailed (engineering) model with a strong differentiation of individual fractions, but it requires an engineering background to use all the features. The model is especially developed for the modeling of the handling of municipal solid wastes, and therefore, it does not support other wastes such as demolition and large commercial waste. The model is useful for an iterative approach to waste system modeling; its database access supports a quick primary calculation of the impacts from a designed waste system using default data, and based on this, a gradually refined focusing on the parts which contribute the most to the total impacts. The EASEWASTE model allows the user to supply detailed data for waste generation, waste composition including material fractions and chemical properties, sorting efficiencies, waste collection, and waste treatment technologies. More generic LCA modeling tools developed for LCA of products do not support these steps of the modeling to the same extent, and also the creation and evaluation of waste collection, waste transportation, and waste treatment technology individually or in a designed scenario is much easier in EASEWASTE.EASEWASTE has been used in the modeling of a number of real case studies, and much data have been incorporated into it. Several research projects are currently underway under the Danish 3R (Residual Resources Recovery) research school in support of its further development. There are, however, still many issues that have to be improved significantly to facilitate application by other users than model developers. The improvements in consideration are to provide data for more treatment and disposal technologies and more flexibility. The current version of the model supports the environmental assessment (environmental impacts and resource consumption) of household and small commercial business units waste treatment systems in a Danish context, but it is the ambition that future versions of the model shall support the inclusion of other waste types as well as economic evaluation and that the geographical coverage shall be extended to other countries.

TI  - The Advancements in Agricultural Greenhouse Technologies: An Energy Management Perspective
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenhouse technologies provide controlled environmental conditions for crop growth, often incorporating automation to enhance productivity. Energy management, which involves monitoring, controlling, and conserving energy, is particularly crucial in northern climates, where greenhouses are among the most energy-intensive sectors of agriculture. This paper presents a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art greenhouse technologies from an energy management perspective, exploring their role in enhancing efficiency and sustainability. It examines the energy management framework, key technological advancements, benefits, challenges, and available solutions in the market. Furthermore, it discusses principles and methods of energy optimization, best practices for sustainable greenhouse operations, and emerging trends in smart grids, renewable integration, and automation. Unlike previous studies primarily focusing on agricultural and control perspectives, this review highlights new insights into integrating greenhouse energy management with smart grid participation, leveraging model predictive control (MPC) for energy optimization, multi-agent reinforcement learning (DRL) for adaptive control, and digital twin technology for real-time system modeling. By bridging greenhouse energy management with transactive energy platforms, this paper underscores the importance of intelligent, data-driven decision-making in enhancing efficiency, sustainability, and system resilience while minimizing environmental impact.

TI  - Model-Driven Development Towards Distributed Intelligent Systems
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A Distributed Intelligent System (DIS) encompasses a set of intelligent subsystems and components that collaborate to perform tasks and solve problems. Given the advancements of paradigms such as the Internet of Things, along with the advancements of technologies such as Machine Learning and Digital Twins, DISs are on the rise. These systems are increasingly integrating components that perform intelligent functions, and these intelligent functions are increasingly heterogeneous and varied. Moreover, there is no standardized framework to help researchers and practitioners adequately address DISs. As a result, the complexity, interoperability issues, and development time and costs of these systems are growing. However, Model-Driven Development (MDD) can help to address these challenges by providing a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for developing DISs. In this work, a DSL for the design, validation, generation, and deployment of DISs is proposed. Firstly, the proposed DSL captures in a metamodel the key and high-level abstract concepts of the distinct DISs documented in the literature. Then, it allows modeling of DISs conforming to this metamodel. Subsequently, the DSL enables formal validation of the modeled systems. Lastly, it allows the generation and deployment of all DISs into production. Therefore, the work undertaken in this communication provides a methodological, formal, and standardized approach to defining and developing DISs from a high level of abstraction. This work allows users to address DISs by facilitating agility, minimizing manual tasks, and re- ducing the number of defects introduced in their development. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed DSL, a real case study of an agricultural digital twin is presented.

AB  - Dynamic modeling is a key part in the development of digital twin (DT) for dynamic systems. This is true for hydropower systems, where whole system modeling including penstock, turbine and generators, etc is important in realizing actuate modeling for the real systems. On the other hand, in response to the large variations of the power demand due to increased penetration of renewables such as wind and solar, hydropower systems are now required to operate in a large power generation range. This situation triggers the nonlinear characteristics of the generation unit with respect to its models. As such, it is imperative to use data driven modeling such as neural networks to learn the nonlinear dynamics of the hydropower generation unit. To achieve this objective, this study constructs a modeling and learning algorithm integrated with multiple structured neural network models for the modeling of turbine shaft speed, penstock pressure, and generator power output based on the generator power control setpoint, field current, and field voltage. In addition, the study uses the hydropower data from Tacoma Public Utilities to train and validate the proposed neural network algorithm. The results have shown that this structured neural network modeling approach can learn the system dynamics effectively by using the real-time data collected from the hydropower system with the desired modeling results.

AB  - Software is an intangible artifact that does not wear out, is not visible to observe how it works, but whose existence can be realized. Fortunately, there are myriad ways used to track the progress and measure the development process, such as project milestones, metrics, and deliverables. We propose tandem conceptual linkages that start from brick-and-mortar artifacts of civil engineering (CE), connecting to the abstract deliverables of software engineering (SE), and visually navigating via the GUI of digital twins (DTs). The processes in between are measured by exploiting agile methods and the Software Engineering Methods and Theory (SEMAT) kernel. The tandem linkages offer an explicit way of working to gauge how the abstract development process of SE artifacts can mimic the concrete structure of CE with the help of DT visualization.

TI  - Continuous engineering for Industry 4.0 architectures and systems
T2  - SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditionally, the quality of a software or system architecture has been evaluated in the early stages of the development process using architecture quality evaluation methods. Emergent approaches like Industry 4.0 require continuous monitoring of both run-time and development-time quality properties, in contrast to traditional systems where quality is evaluated at specific milestones using techniques such as project reviews. Considering the dynamics and minimum down-time imposed by the industrial production domain, it must also be ensured that Industry 4.0 system evaluations are continuously performed with high confidence and with as much automation as possible, using simulations, for instance. In this regard, there is a need to develop new methods for continuously monitoring and evaluating the quality properties of software-based systems for Industry 4.0, which must be supported by automated quality evaluation techniques. In this research we analyze traditional architecture evaluation methods and Industry 4.0 scenarios, and propose an approach based on Digital Twins and simulations to continuously evaluate runtime quality aspects of the architecture and systems of industrial production plants. The evaluation is based on the instantiation of our approach for a concrete demand of an automation plant in the automotive domain.

AB  - The current trend in production systems development is shifted towards the software part. This is emphasized by the concepts of digital twins and Software-Defined Manufacturing (SDM). These software-intensive and safety-critical systems have more frequent software updates to address higher system flexibility and adjustable production processes. SDMsystems bring new challenges to the reliability assessment. Each update can change the system behavior significantly. This leads to the necessity to reconduct reliability assessment automatically before each software update. In this paper, we introduce the concept of an automated modelbased reliability assessment method sensible to the software update. The paper describes the key idea of the method and demonstrates its application on a model of a robotic manipulator.

TI  - Physics-informed deep residual neural network for finned-tube evaporator performance prediction
T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Finned-tube heat exchangers are extensively used in industrial and daily life. As complex system designs and digital twins increase, higher demands arise for predictive modeling of finned-tube heat exchanger performance. Previous studies faced issues like disparities in evaporator performance under dry and wet conditions, inaccurate predictions of refrigerant pressure drop, and a lack of comprehensive consideration for predicting the trends in physical details. With the evolution of AI algorithms, exploring novel modeling methods becomes essential. Therefore, this study proposes a physics-informed deep residual network model for accurate performance prediction of finned-tube evaporators. The model achieved mean absolute error of 0.14 % for heat transfer rate prediction, 0.36 % for refrigerant pressure drop prediction, and 0.49 % for air pressure drop prediction. This model addresses previous issues of performance disparities under dry and wet conditions and high errors in refrigerant pressure drop prediction. The proposed deep residual network model is found much better performance in capturing physical details than other machine learning approaches. It can serve as a benchmark model for transfer learning or complex system modeling. The method of determining the structure of residual networks through a priori physical knowledge also provides a new perspective on modeling physical systems.

TI  - A Modular IoT-Based Architecture for Logistics Service Performance Assessment and Real-Time Scheduling towards a Synchromodal Transport System
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Logistics is significantly impacted by quality/quantity issues associated with data collection and data sharing restrictions. Nonetheless, public data from national entities and internet-of-things (IoT) solutions enable the development of integrated tools for performance analysis and real-time optimization of logistics networks. This study proposes a three-module data-driven system architecture that covers (a) logistics data collection tools, (b) logistics services performance evaluation, and (c) the transition to synchromodal systems. Module 1 integrates multisource data from national logistics platforms and embedded devices placed within intermodal containers. A multigraph representation of the problem is conceived. Environmental, economic, and operational data are generated and injected into a digital twin. Thus, key performance indicators (KPIs) are computed by simulation or direct transformation of the collected data. Module 2 uses Multi-directional Efficiency Analysis, an optimization algorithm that benchmarks multimodal transportation routes of containers using prior KPIs. Outputs are a technical performance index relevant to logistics clients and improvement measures for logistics service providers. A real case study application of the solution proposed for Module 2 is presented. Module 3 provides real-time scheduling and assignment models using CP-sat solvers, accommodating varying system dynamics and resource availability, minimizing makespan and operational costs.

TI  - Software framework concept with visual programming and digital twin for intuitive process creation with multiple robotic systems
T2  - ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the progressive digitalization in industrial manufacturing, the usage of complex robotic systems in both intralogistics and production is expected to increase. This proposes a challenge for planners and shop floor workers, as programming and interacting with these various systems leads to a high cognitive load. Especially the broad range of different manufacturer specific software leads to a number of problems, e.g. the program -synchronization between different systems and the often necessary workshops for workers. These problems can lead to inefficient programming and planning operations, bad worker satisfaction and human errors. In this paper, we present a modular, system agnostic and human centered software framework that unifies the pro-gramming of different systems, to enable centralized and intuitive system programming for non-expert operators. Our software framework utilizes visual programming concepts together with an integrated digital twin of the factory and a novel graph-based programming interface. We explain our concept in detail and describe our validation through integration into a realistic industrial setup with three different systems. In addition, we provide an evaluation of our concept's usability with an experimental user study and discuss the results of the study and the software implementation. Our study results show that even non-technical users are able to use our software after a brief introduction to create complex processes that involve multiple machines working in par-allel. All users reported high usability and expert users reported that the visual process editor has enough features to create processes for industrial applications. Finally, we conclude this paper by providing an outlook on future work and use-cases of our software.

T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Affected by electric field generated in power transmission line, live worker on the high-voltage transmission line is in dangerous working environment. In this paper, posture perception, numerical simulation, and risk assessment are adopted to realize the deep fusion of physical trajectory and spatial virtual electric field distribution of live worker, and digital twin bodies of live worker in different live working scenarios are constructed. Firstly, posture trajectories and 3D model of living worker in typical operation conditions are captured and reconstructed by full-body inertial action capture technology and this technology use motion capture unit which include 3-aixs accelerometer/gyroscope/magnetic field sensors. The length of complex gap and body workspace under various live work scenes are also calculated. By static electrical field finite element (FE) numerical modeling, surface electrical field distributions of live worker under different posture trajectories are then calculated. Finally, interactive mechanism between "body-information-physical environment-virtual environment" is introduced, and potential risk of live worker is on-line assessed by live work guide rules. This work develops a new assessment and protection method for virtual training and field operations of high-voltage live worker. Which is of great significance for enhancing operation level and ensuring living workers' safety.

AB  - Small multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), mainly quadcopters, are nowadays ubiquitous in research on aerial autonomy, including serving as scaled-down models for much larger aircraft such as vertical-take-off-and-lift vehicles for urban air mobility. Among the various research use cases, first-person-view (FPV) RC flight experiments allow for collecting data on how human pilots fly such aircraft, which could then be used to compare, contrast, validate, or train (via imitative learning) autonomous flight agents. While this could be uniquely beneficial, especially for studying UAV operation in contextually complex and safety-critical environments such as in human-UAV shared spaces, the lack of inexpensive and open-source hardware/software platforms that offer this capability along with low-level (complete access) to the underlying control software and data remains limited. To address this gap and significantly reduce barriers to human-guided autonomy research with UAVs, this paper presents an open-source software architecture implemented with an inexpensive in-house built quadcopter platform based on the F450 Quadcopter Frame. This setup uses two cameras to provide a dual-view FPV and an open-source flight controller, Pixhawk. The underlying software architecture, developed using the Python-based Kivy library, allows logging telemetry, GPS, control inputs, and camera frame data in a synchronized manner on the ground station computer. Since costs (time) and weather constraints typically limit numbers of physical outdoor flight experiments, this paper also presents a unique AirSim/Unreal Engine based simulation environment and graphical user interface (GUI) - aka digital twin - that provides a Hardware In The Loop (HITL) setup via the Pixhawk flight controller. We demonstrate the usability and reliability of the overall framework through a set of diverse physical FPV flight experiments and corresponding flight tests in the digital twin.

                   NOVELTY - The method involves calculating the need to                ventilate a zone of concern. The optimal quantity                of ventilation needed for that zone of interest in                terms of machinery locations, and the status and                operating status of personnel are calculated. The                remote control of the flow of ventilation in that                zone of interest is calculated. An optimum                ventilation volume is determined, which consists of                the computation of monitoring data by a model of                the ventilation system tailored to calculate the                optimized ventilation amount needed in that area of                interest.

                    ADVANTAGE - The coal mine ventilation system ensures                proper ventilation near the working area. The                additional sprays are mounted on the machine panel                to effectively barrier that panel and the                fixed-line curtain.

TI  - Identification and Structuring of Benefits and Expenses for Evaluating the Profitability of Investments in Digitization within Production
T2  - SUSTAINABLE MANUFACTURING FOR GLOBAL CIRCULAR ECONOMY
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 16th Global Conference on Sustainable Manufacturing (GCSM)
CL  - Univ Kentucky, Inst Sustainable Mfg, Lexington, KY
AB  - Digitization opens up countless opportunities to improve a production. Potentials range from condition monitoring of individual machines to fully autonomously controlled production systems. Nevertheless, investments are usually required to exploit those potentials. Companies often need to connect machines, buy, update or expand IT systems or carry out projects regarding the digital twin across multiple departments. The implementation of such projects requires an integrated system analysis and thus know-how from the most diverse technical and scientific disciplines. An additional economic evaluation requires further economic know-how. This paper makes a contribution to identifying and structuring the potentials, benefits and costs of digitization. A scheme for the evaluation of investments in digitization is presented. It enables a structured analysis of restrictions, efforts and potentials of possible investments. The approach thus makes it possible to evaluate a potential investment within the setting of a workshop. This enables cross-departmental and cross-disciplinary understanding on the benefits and costs of an investment in the context of digitization. The method is presented on the basis of a project for introducing tablets in production at a switchgear manufacturer. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B. V.

TI  - Digital Twin: Toward the Integration Between System Design and RAMS Assessment Through the Model-Based Systems Engineering
T2  - IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The design of a safety-critical system requires an effective prediction of its reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety (RAMS). Anticipating the RAMS analysis at the concept design helps the designer in the tradeoff of the system architecture and technologies, reduces the cost of product development and the time to market. This action is rather difficult, because the RAMS analysis deals with the hazard assessment of system components, whose abstraction at concept level is never simple. Therefore, to integrate the system design and RAMS assessment, a clear path to follow is required. This article investigates how the model-based systems engineering supports this task and drives the system reliability allocation, through the functional and dysfunctional analyses. The implementation of the proposed approach needs to set up the tool chain. In the industrial context, it must be compatible with practices, standards, and tools currently used in product development. Defining a suitable process of integration of tools used for the system design and the safety engineering is a need of the industry. Therefore, this task is also discussed, in this article, dealing with some examples of industrial test cases.

AB  - This work aims at new opportunities for the development of the robot communication network. Besides, a robot operation and decision control method driven by Digital Twins (DT) is designed to utilize lasers in a virtual environment. The multi-agent is integrated with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, forming the Muti-PPO algorithm for robot path planning. In addition, a consistent hashing algorithm is introduced and optimized as a Weighted Consistent Hash of Multiple Mappings (WCHMM) algorithm with multiple mappings. The experimental results indicate that the average task execution time of the WCHMM algorithm in the case of three bus nodes is 8.09s, which is 32.47 percent and 21.38 percent lower than the task execution time in the case of a single bus node and two bus nodes, respectively.

TI  - A Comprehensive Survey on GenAI-Enabled 6G: Technologies, Challenges, and Future Research Avenues
T2  - IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in 6G demonstrates a transformative leap in redefining network efficiency, intelligence, and adaptability. However, AI largely leverages discriminative models relying on labelled and quality data, where data accessibility remains serious concern. Generative AI (GenAI) has gained traction due to its immense potential in resolving the issue of data scarcity, complexity, and incompleteness. GenAI models excel in understanding underlying data distributions, enabling them to generate synthetic data that mirrors real-world patterns. GenAI supports adaptive learning and scenario modeling, making it indispensable for addressing the unpredictability and complexity inherent in 6G networks. Since the complexity of wireless communication systems is increasing and the demand for such systems is growing, GenAI presents new ideas for enhancing network performance, increasing system efficiency, and developing intelligent decision-making capabilities. This survey paper investigates the promising role of GenAI in the evolution of 6G networks. An in-depth discussion of notable GenAI models is presented, outlining their application in enhancing key network components. Specifically, the application of GenAI in advanced technologies including reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), digital twins (DTs), and integrated sensing and communications (ISACs) is thoroughly investigated with respect to optimize the adaptability, flexibility, and robustness of the wireless networks. Moreover, use cases of GenAI-enabled wireless networks are presented to highlight the realization of GenAI in 6G. The paper also presents the lessons learned, existing challenges, and future research directions. This paper systematically explores GenAI and its pivotal role in the development of 6G, providing a foundation for researchers to further investigate and advance GenAI-enabled 6G.

TI  - Use of gaming technology to bring bridge inspection to the office
T2  - STRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a novel method for bridge inspection that essentially digitises bridges using Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) so that they can be later inspected in a virtual reality (VR) environment. The work uses conventional terrestrial LIDAR together with affordable VR hardware and freely available software development kits originally intended for authoring computer games. The resulting VR app is evaluated for a case study involving a typical masonry bridge, comparing the proposed technique with traditional inspection methods. The new approach promises to be highly effective in terms of interpretation of results, accessibility to critical areas and safety of inspectors. The work represents an important step towards the creation of digital twins of important assets in the built environment. Recent bridge collapse incidents have affected local economies, traffic congestion, and in some extreme cases led to a loss of life. The work is timely as law making agencies are paying greater attention to structural rehabilitation. This paper will be of particular interest to bridge engineers, construction professionals and law makers and could lead to future revisions of bridge inspection processes and standards.

TI  - Applying a Healthcare Web of Things Framework for Infertility Treatments
T2  - WEB ENGINEERING (ICWE 2022)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 22nd International Conference on Web Engineering (ICWE)
CL  - Bari, ITALY
AB  - According to doctors and researchers, fertility problems are becoming epidemic proportions. Meanwhile, the demand for infertility treatment is increasing by 5-10% per year. To support the growing demand, physicians need to define personalized remote monitoring treatments supported by devices that send real-time information on hormones levels, heart-rate, temperature, etc. To this end, Healthcare Monitoring Systems (HMS) have recently appeared, based on increasingly advanced devices that help to manage this task. However, current solutions are expensive and not very customizable by physicians themselves. In this paper, we propose a framework called MoSTHealth, based on digital twins and Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), allows healthcare experts to model a personalized Web of Things (WoT) HMS scenario per treatment and per patient. Thanks to MDE, the simulated scenario allows us to generate a Service-Oriented enterprise cloud architecture that integrates a prediction module based on machine learning and data analysis. In this paper, a WoT HMS scenario for infertility treatment is presented as a case study. In this scenario, a specific care plan is defined, associated with a set of devices, including the use of a biosensing device that sends hormones levels in real-time.

TI  - Digital Twin for Train Maintenance
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - The aim of this research is to advance the methods and knowledge for planning and scheduling train maintenance through the use of digital twinning technologies.  Architecture pattern for a Digital Twin  There exist two system architecture patterns, namely server-based and edge-based Communication latency requirement for a Digital Twin  The application scenario determines the required communication latency between a physical device and its Digital Twin.  Data capture mechanism Two common methods can be used to gather data from physical devices, i.e., capturing changes and taking snapshots.  Functionalities of a Digital Twin Existing Digital Twin applications are mainly developed for monitoring and prediction purposes. Digital Twin model version management A Digital Twin model can evolve over time as a result of engineering changes to its physical counterpart.  RESEARCH QUESTIONS Q3: What is the impact of carrying out regular train maintenance even if some of it not needed? Q4: What is the impact of using Digital Twin for train maintenance? Q5: How could Digital Twine be adapted quicker in rail industry? ENGINEERING METHODOLOGY   Literature study  Standard literature for existing research will be carried out  Cost-benefit analysis  The assessment of cost and benefits for using digital twin will be compared with the current cost been used IF there is a possibility to obtain the current cost for train maintenance.   Computational design, simulation and/or Lab experiment  Any designed models or suggested ones will be designed using various CAD software and tested using simulation or lab experiments. The result will be validated by testing it again in real depot for maintenance  Mathematical modelling (Optimization) A mixed integer optimization model could be developed in an iterative approach, by documenting the mathematical formulation and coding it in Python, using OR-Tools as modelling layer and Gurobi as optimization solver.   Novel physical sciences   BACKGROUND Today transport operators are facing new challenges, with the increase of number of passengers and the growing need for extra service provision, at the same time they have budgetary constraints, in order to meet the demand. One solution for meeting these new challenges is to improve maintenance and adapt the new technologies for maintenance (Digital Twin for maintenance). The term Digital Twin (DT) was brought to the general public for the first time in Shafto et al. (2010) and Shafto et al. (2012). A digital twin is a "live", evolving digital replica of the historical and current behavior of a physical object or process that helps optimize business performance. Digital Twin in the technological world is acting as a mirror in the real world (Glaessgen & Stargel, 2012

AB  - We present a software framework that integrates Arduino-enabled remote devices with the UNITY game engine through Internet-of-Things technology. The framework allows a technology stack where networked physical devices become digital-twin game objects in UNITY. This makes it possible for game developers without competence in electronics or Arduino programming to develop hybrid pervasive games directly in UNITY. The framework was implemented in C# on the UNITY side and C++ on the Arduino side, using MQTT as a message broker. The first version of the framework was evaluated empirically with UNITY game developers, resulting in requirements for an updated version. The updated version was used to develop a hybrid pervasive exergame for elderly, which is presented in the paper. The overall positive feedback from the evaluation with game developers and our own experience using the framework encourages us to develop the framework further and integrating it as much as possible with the UNITY development environment. Our aim is to make developing hybrid pervasive games possible for UNITY game developers, without requiring them to concern themselves with the troubles of networks, electronics, or low-level microcontroller programming.

AB  - Rapidly increasing level of digitalization in all levels of society create pressure for software engineering education about capacity to apply also higher abstraction level physics or mathematics in selected application areas. In this study a simple simulation solution was implemented with standard software tools (Python and open-source libraries) to create and test example of an approach to tackle the challenges about combining simple software and abstraction levels of mathematics or physics. The results illustrate that it is possible to implement higher level ideas by simple software implementations like shown in this study. The findings and reflections of this study may be useful in education or application development in software engineering in fields of artificial intelligence, collaborative robotics, or digital twins.

TI  - Robust Ruddlesden-Popper phase Sr3Fe1.3Mo0.5Ni0.2O7-δ decorated with in-situ exsolved Ni nanoparticles as an efficient anode for hydrocarbon fueled solid oxide fuel cells
T2  - SUSMAT
M3  - Article
AB  - A highly efficient Ruddlesden-Popper structure anode material with a formula of Sr3Fe1.3Mo0.5Ni0.2O7-delta (RP-SFMN) has been developed for hydrocarbon fueled solid oxide fuel cells (HF-SOFC) application. It is demonstrated that a nanostructured RP-SFMN anode decorated with in-situ exsolved Ni nanoparticles (Ni@RP-SFMN) has been successfully prepared by annealing the anode in reducing atmosphere similar to the operating conditions. The phase compositions, valence states, morphologies, and electrocatalytic activities of RP-SFMN material have been characterized in detail. In addition, the in-situ exsolution mechanism of the metallic Ni phase from the parent oxide is clearly explained by using density function theory calculation. The peak output power density at 800 degrees C is significantly enhanced from 0.163 to 0.409 W/cm(2) while the electrode polarization resistance is effectively lowered from 0.96 to 0.30 Omega cm(2) by the substitution of B-site Fe by Ni, which is attributed to the improved electrocatalytic activities induced by the in-situ exsolved Ni nanocatalysts. Moreover, the single cell with RP-SFMN anode exhibits good stability in 3% H2O humidified H-2 and syngas for 110 and 60 h at 800 degrees C, respectively. Our findings indicate that RP-SFMN is a greatly promising anode candidate of HF-SOFCs due to its good electrochemical performance and stability during the operation.

AB  - Software Engineering must increasingly address the issues of complexity and uncertainty that arise when systems are to be deployed into a dynamic software ecosystem. There is also interest in using digital twins of systems in order to design, adapt and control them when faced with such issues. The use of multi-agent systems in combination with reinforcement learning is an approach that will allow software to intelligently adapt to respond to changes in the environment. This paper proposes a language extension that encapsulates learning-based agents and system building operations and shows how it is implemented in ESL. The paper includes examples the key features and describes the application of agent-based learning implemented in ESL applied to a real-world supply chain.

TI  - A Generalised Methodology for the Diagnosis of Aircraft Systems
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - An aircraft is made up of a number of complicated systems which work in harmony to ensure safe and trouble-free flight. In order to maintain such a platform, many diagnostic and prognostic techniques have been suggested, mostly aimed at components but some at the system level. Together these form a patchwork approach to the overall problem of efficiently informing aircraft maintenance to the Original Equipment Manufacturers, the operators /airlines, and the Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul organisations. It involves these organisations having to support several different approaches to aircraft health management, and is therefore inefficient and costly. In the current work, a streamlined methodology is put forward. This is based on OSA-CBM (Open System Architecture for Condition Based Maintenance) and can be applied to any aircraft system. Integral with this is the use of mRMR (minimum redundancy maximum relevance) for feature selection, the resulting symptom vector being used for fault diagnosis. This approach is demonstrated on three test cases: the engine, the environmental control system, and the fuel system. In each case, the digital twin setup, simulation conditions for healthy and faulty scenarios, a methodology based on OSA-CBM up to diagnostics are detailed. Diagnostics is carried out for each system in turn, using four machine learning supervised algorithms. The best performing algorithm for each system will then subsequently be used in a vehicle level reasoner called FAVER (A Framework for Aerospace Vehicle Reasoning), which requires these system diagnoses as a starting point for vehicle reasoning and fault ambiguity resolution.

TI  - Integration of an energy management tool and digital twin for coordination and control of multi-vector smart energy systems
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - As Internet of Things (IoT) technologies enable greater communication between energy assets in smart cities, the operational coordination of various energy networks in a city or district becomes more viable. Suitable tools are needed that can harness advanced control and machine learning techniques to achieve environmental, economic and resilience objectives. In this paper, an energy management tool is presented that can offer optimal control, scheduling, forecasting and coordination services to energy assets across a district, enabling optimal decisions under user-defined objectives. The tool presented here can coordinate different sub-systems in a district to avoid the violation of high-level system constraints and is designed in a generic fashion to enable transferable use across different energy sectors. The work demonstrates the potential for a single open-source optimisation framework to be applied across multiple energy vectors, providing local government the opportunity to manage different assets in a coordinated fashion. This is shown through case studies that integrate low-carbon communal heating for social housing with electric vehicle charge-point management to achieve high-level system constraints and local government objectives in the borough of Greenwich, London. The paper illustrates the theoretical methodology, the software architecture and the digital twin-based testing environment underpinning the proposed approach.

AB  - Uncertain, unpredictable, real-time, and lifelong evolution causes operational failures in intelligent software systems, leading to significant damages, safety and security hazards, and tragedies. To fully unleash such systems' potential and facilitate their wider adoption, ensuring the trustworthiness of their decision-making under uncertainty is the prime challenge. To overcome this challenge, an intelligent software system and its operating environment should be continuously monitored, tested, and refined during its lifetime operation. Existing technologies, such as digital twins, can enable continuous synchronisation with such systems to reflect their most up-to-date states. Such representations are often in the form of prior-knowledge-based and machine-learning models, together called 'model universe'. In this paper, we present our vision of combining techniques from software engineering, evolutionary computation, and machine learning to support the model universe evolution.

TI  - Data fabric and digital twins: An integrated approach for data fusion design and evaluation of pervasive systems
T2  - INFORMATION FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent technological improvements have made it possible for pervasive computing intelligent environments, augmented by sensors and actuators, to offer services that support society's aims for a wide variety of appli-cations. This requires the fusion of data gathered from multiple sensors to convert them into information to obtain valuable knowledge. Poor implementation of data fusion hinders the appropriate actions from being taken and offering the appropriate support to users and environment needs, particularly relevant in the healthcare domain. Data fusion poses challenges that are mainly related to the quality of the data or data sources, the definition of a data fusion process and evaluating the data fusion carried out. There is also a lack of holistic engineering frameworks to address these challenges. These frameworks should be able to support automated methods of extracting knowledge from information, selecting algorithms and techniques, assessing information and evaluating information fusion systems in an automatic and standardized manner. This work proposes a holistic framework to improve data fusion in pervasive systems, addressing the issues identified by means of two processes: the first of which guides the design of the system architecture and focuses on data management. It is based on a previous proposal that integrated aspects of Data Fabric and Digital Twins to solve data management and data contextualization and representation issues, respectively. The extension of the previous proposal pre-sented here was mainly defined by integrating aspects and techniques from different well-known multi-sensor data fusion models. The previous proposal identified high-level data processing activities and was intended to facilitate their traceability to components in the system architecture. However, the previously defined stages are not completely adequate in a data fusion process and the data processing tasks to be performed in each stage are not described in detail, especially in the data fusion stages. The second process of the framework deals with evaluating data fusion systems and is based on international standards to ensure the quality of the data fusion tasks performed by such systems. This process also offers guidelines for designing the architecture of an eval-uation subsystem to automatically perform data fusion evaluation in runtime as part of the system. To illustrate the proposal, a system for preventing the spread of COVID-19 in nursing homes is described that was developed using the proposed guidelines It is also illustrated by a description of how the data fusion tasks it supports are evaluated by the proposed evaluation process. The overall evaluation of the data fusion performed by this system was considered satisfactory, which indicates that the proposal facilitates the design and development of data fusion systems and helps to achieve the necessary quality requirements.

AB  - Modern businesses are being subjected to an unprecedented variety of change drivers that cannot be predicted such as new regulations, emerging business models, and changing needs of stakeholders. This creates new demands on enterprises to meet stated goals in a dynamic and uncertain environment that translate to demands on the enterprise's software systems. In our earlier work, we proposed an architecture for dynamic adaptation under uncertainty. In this paper, we provide validation of our adaptation architecture through a case study of a wellness ecosystem comprising multiple stakeholders with evolving goals and behavior that need to be continuously learnt and adapted. We present experimentation results from our case study that serve as an initial step towards validating our approach.

TI  - Educational 5G Edge Computing: Framework and Experimental Study
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Benefiting from the large-scale commercial use of 5G, smart campuses have attracted increasing research attention in recent years and are expected to revolutionize traditional campus activities. However, there are some obstacles that hinder the practical deployment of MEC (multi-access edge computing). First, traditional information infrastructures on campus cannot support latency-sensitive and computing-intensive smart applications, such as AR/VR, live interactive lectures and digital twin experiments. In addition, the mixture of old and new applications, isolated data islands and heterogeneous equipment management introduce more challenges. Moreover, the existing MEC framework proposed by ETSI and 3GPP cannot meet the specific deployment requirements of smart campuses, e.g., educational data security, real-time interactive applications, heterogeneous connections, and others. In this paper, we propose a 5G-based architecture for smart education information infrastructure; a new dedicated cloud architecture eMEC (educational multi-access edge computing) is defined. It consists of a UGW (universal access gateway) and an eMEP (educational multi-access edge computing platform), making it possible to satisfy education-specific requirements and long-term evolution. Furthermore, we implement the framework and conduct real-world field tests for eMEC in a university campus. Based on the framework and practical field tests, we also conduct a measurement study to unveil the spatial-temporal characteristics of mobile users in the smart campus and discuss exploiting them for better network performance. The experimental results show that the system achieves satisfactory performance in terms of both throughput and latency.

TI  - Sparks of Generative Pretrained Transformers in Edge Intelligence for the Metaverse: Caching and Inference for Mobile Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content Services
T2  - IEEE VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY MAGAZINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the metaverse, pretrained foundation models (PFMs), e.g., generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), can effectively provide various artificial intelligence (AI) services, such as autonomous driving, digital twins (DTs), and AI-generated content (AIGC) for extended reality (XR). With the advantages of low latency and privacy-preserving, serving PFMs of mobile AI services in edge intelligence is a viable solution for caching and executing PFMs on edge servers with limited computing resources and GPU memory. However, PFMs typically consist of billions of parameters that are computation- and memory-intensive for edge servers during loading and execution. In this article, we investigate edge PFM serving problems for mobile AIGC services of the metaverse. First, we introduce the fundamentals of PFMs and discuss their characteristic fine-tuning and inference methods in edge intelligence. Then, we propose a novel framework of joint model caching and inference for managing models and allocating resources to satisfy users' requests efficiently. Furthermore, considering the in-context learning ability of PFMs, we propose a new metric to evaluate the freshness and relevance between examples in demonstrations and executing tasks, namely the Age of Context (AoC). Finally, we propose a least-context (LC) algorithm for managing cached models at edge servers by balancing the tradeoff among latency, energy consumption, and accuracy.

TI  - Deep learning based real-time energy extraction system modeling for flapping foil
T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the increasing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, the promising energy extraction system via flapping foil for flow and wind energy has attracted more and more attention. Due to the expensive computation resource and time cost, the CFD method impedes the realization of real-time modeling for flapping foil. The surrogate model by machine learning is a promising alternative, but it only focuses on the objective functions and ignores the importance of physical fields. Aiming at providing a comprehensive model to predict the aerodynamic characteristics as well as the physical fields, a deep learning based real-time model containing two modular convolutional neural networks are devised in this paper. With the numerical simulations as training dataset, a well-trained model can accurately predict the pressure and velocity fields as well as the lift and moment coefficients in milli-second. Moreover, the global sensitivity analysis and the optimizations are conducted based on this model. By leveraging the automatic differential mechanics in deep learning method, the time con-sumption for kinematic optimization is accelerated into a minute, which further demonstrates the real-time capability. Overall, the presented deep learning model can provide a reliable and competitive choice for the digital twin of flapping foil energy extraction system.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Transitioning from a meta-simulator to electrical applications: An architecture
T2  - SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, simulators are used in different applications, such as benchmarking tools, for entertainment and educational purposes, to test scenarios that otherwise would not be possible to analyze (e.g., for security reasons) or to evaluate business and regulatory models. Nevertheless, simulators are usually tailor-made for a specific application. This paper proposes an original approach, an architecture for a software tool capable of simulating any electric power system application, the first energy-oriented meta-simulator. This tool would only require the definition of a set of behavior rules, easing the process of developing new simulators aimed at the energy sector. Its applications range from pure software simulators, that could be used with, for example, benchmarking, decision-making or competition purposes, to applications monitoring and controlling energy assets in real-time, such as hardware devices (e.g., sensors, actuators, or power plants) or digital twins. The proposed architecture resulted by studying previous tools and simulators with the objective of finding common blocks and elements to abstract them. For this reason, the proposed architecture intents to encompass any tool that aims to model the energy sector. Additionally, the proposed architecture is compliant with lightweight Internet of Things (IoT) protocols and smart systems and supports the synchronization with other frameworks at different levels.

TI  - RLOps: Development Life-Cycle of Reinforcement Learning Aided Open RAN
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Radio access network (RAN) technologies continue to evolve, with Open RAN gaining the most recent momentum. In the O-RAN specifications, the RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) are software-defined orchestration and automation functions for the intelligent management of RAN. This article introduces principles for machine learning (ML), in particular, reinforcement learning (RL) applications in the O-RAN stack. Furthermore, we review the state-of-the-art research in wireless networks and cast it onto the RAN framework and the hierarchy of the O-RAN architecture. We provide a taxonomy for the challenges faced by ML/RL models throughout the development life-cycle: from the system specification to production deployment (data acquisition, model design, testing and management, etc.). To address the challenges, we integrate a set of existing MLOps principles with unique characteristics when RL agents are considered. This paper discusses a systematic model development, testing and validation life-cycle, termed: RLOps. We discuss fundamental parts of RLOps, which include: model specification, development, production environment serving, operations monitoring and safety/security. Based on these principles, we propose the best practices for RLOps to achieve an automated and reproducible model development process. At last, a holistic data analytics platform rooted in the O-RAN deployment is designed and implemented, aiming to embrace and fulfil the aforementioned principles and best practices of RLOps.

TI  - Models in Systems Engineering: From Engineering Artifacts to Source of Competitive Advantage
T2  - RECENT TRENDS AND ADVANCES IN MODEL BASED SYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 18th Annual Conference on Systems Engineering Research (CSER)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Models in systems engineering have existed in various forms dating back to the 1950s. They have been used by engineers to understand various types of phenomena, envision future systems, and generate engineering artifacts. Today the increasing complexity of operational missions and technological advances enabled in part by disciplinary convergence and wide access to data are having a dramatic impact on system modeling. Operational missions are becoming increasingly more complex with multiple sources of uncertainty and subject to a variety of disruptions. Technological advances paced by advances in semantic technologies, machine learning, AI, and applied analytics are transforming model development into a closed-loop process. The advent of Industry 4.0 and digital engineering (including digital twin and digital thread) is causing models to be viewed in an entirely new light. And the convergence of engineering with other disciplines is opening up a whole new way of developing system models. This paper presents a historical perspective on models over several decades and offers a vision of how recent developments are likely to shape the trajectory of system models in the future.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 36th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST)
CL  - San Francisco, CA
AB  - Manipulating their environment is one of the fundamental actions that humans, and actors more generally, perform. Yet, today's mixed reality systems enable us to situate virtual content in the physical scene but fall short of expanding the visual illusion to believable environment manipulations. In this paper, we present the concept and system of Scene Responsiveness, the visual illusion that virtual actions affect the physical scene. Using co-aligned digital twins for coherence-preserving just-in-time virtualization of physical objects in the environment, Scene Responsiveness allows actors to seemingly manipulate physical objects as if they were virtual. Based on Scene Responsiveness, we propose two general types of end to-end illusionary experiences that ensure visuotactile consistency through the presented techniques of object elusiveness and object rephysicalization. We demonstrate how our Daydreaming illusion enables virtual characters to enter the scene through a physically closed door and vandalize the physical scene, or users to enchant and summon far-away physical objects. In a user evaluation of our Copperfield illusion, we found that Scene Responsiveness can be rendered so convincingly that it lends itself to magic tricks. We present our system architecture and conclude by discussing the implications of scene-responsive mixed reality for gaming and telepresence.

TI  - Run-time threat models for systematic and continuous risk assessment
T2  - SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS MODELING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Threat modeling involves systematically assessing the likelihood and potential impact of diverse security threat scenarios. Existing threat modeling approaches and tools act at the level of a software architecture or design (e.g., a data flow diagram), at the level of abstract system elements. These approaches, however, do not allow more in-depth analysis that takes into account concrete instances and configurations of these elements. This lack of expressiveness-as threats that require articulation at the level of instances cannot be expressed nor managed properly-hinders systematic risk calculation-as risks cannot be expressed and estimated in terms of instance-level properties. In this paper, we present a novel threat modeling approach that supports modeling complex systems at two distinct levels: (i) the design model defines the classes and entity types in the system, and (ii) the instance model specifies concrete instances and their properties. This innovation allows systematically calculating broader risk estimates at the design level, yet also performing more refined analysis in terms of more precise risk values at the instance level. Moreover, the ability to assess instance-level risks serves as an enabler for run-time continuous threat and risk (re-)assessment, and risk-adaptive security in general. We evaluate this approach in a prototype and through simulation of the dynamics of a realistic IoT-based system, a smart traffic application that involves vehicles and other infrastructural elements such as smart traffic lights. In these efforts, we demonstrate the practical feasibility of the approach, and we quantify the performance cost of maintaining a threat model at run-time, taking into account the time to perform risk assessment.

AB  - With the rise of Industry 4.0, businesses are increasingly turning to Machine Learning to leverage data for improving quality and productivity. However, one open challenge when embracing Machine Learning in this context is the integration of cloud infrastructures, as well as the heterogeneity of data, interfaces, and protocols in the production environment. To address this, we are developing a framework that aims to simplify the adoption of Machine Learning techniques for heterogeneous industrial automation systems. One of the core features of this framework is the ability to handle data about production devices - a scenario that is naturally suited to the use of Asset Administration Shells. However, the implementation of a system that uses Asset Administration Shells comes with its own set of challenges, such as the abstraction of details from users and the representation of device topologies. Thus, this paper introduces the concepts and implementation of a Metadata Manager component in the aforementioned framework that uses Asset Administration Shells as its basis. We further examine the Metadata Manager's current structure with unit testing, derive planned extensions, and discuss future directions from the Industry 4.0 perspective.

AB  - To reach decarbonisation goals, energy systems are becoming increasingly complex and deeply integrated with other sectors and activities through digital technologies such as Big Data analytics and Digital Twins. In recent years, co -simulation has become a powerful technique to study complex cyber-physical integrated energy systems. Indeed, co -simulation enables the coupling of diverse simulators, each specialised in modelling a specific aspect of the system, to provide a comprehensive understanding of its behaviour.As the simulation scenarios grow in scale and complexity, they require more extensive compute infrastructures to scale horizontally. Yet, deploying and operating co -simulation platforms in distributed computing infrastructures remains a difficult task. This paper explores the challenges faced in achieving scalable co-simulation through horizontal distribution using cluster/cloud deployments, both in terms of engineering complexity for deploying and operating co-simulation platforms and in terms of absolute performance and scalability. It proposes a novel framework to streamline the process of deploying and operating complex co -simulation scenarios in cloud environments. The framework adopts established methodologies in engineering software solutions in the cloud to deploy and operate co -simulations. Specifically, it adopts containerisation technologies to decouple the definition of the simulation scenario from the execution infrastructure, automating and abstracting away distribution and deployment concerns and allowing seamless migration to different computing infrastructures. An initial assessment of absolute performance and scalability of realistic co-simulation scenarios within the proposed framework shows the benefits of horizontal scaling but also the performance bottlenecks introduced by current technologies for orchestrating simulators.

TI  - Rigorous Indoor Wireless Communication System Simulations With Deep Learning-Based Radio Propagation Models
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL ON MULTISCALE AND MULTIPHYSICS COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, there has been a surge in the development of data-driven propagation models. These models aspire to distill knowledge from propagation solvers or measured data and eventually become capable of predicting characteristics related to radiowave propagation. In this paper, we present the functionality of a generalizable and robust data-driven propagation model that enables efficient and reliable simulations of indoor wireless communication systems (IWCSs). In particular, we modify our previously introduced model, EM DeepRay, to consider the impact of antenna directivity, and we present a training and inference strategy that allows the simulation of large-scale and complicated IWCSs. Our data-driven model is trained over a rich data set comprising diverse building geometries, frequency bands, and antenna radiation patterns. Benchmarking its performance with that of a ray-tracer in complicated IWCSs with real-world measured data yields similar results that have a distinct advantage in terms of computational time. Ultimately, our work paves the way for replacing legacy IWCSs simulators, with high-fidelity artificial intelligence-based models.

TI  - Designing Construction 4.0 Activities for AEC Classrooms
T2  - BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes the outcomes of the development of the project MATES to STEAM. The project is aimed at integrating Construction 4.0 content to a recently started new degree on Technologies on Civil Engineering. This integration is underpinned by the creation of STEAM-rich activities that can complement such degree. The philosophical design of these activities followed three requirements: (i) the activities should infuse Construction 4.0-related technologies, (ii) the activities should foster motivation among students with a STEAM vision by-design and (iii) the activities should be designed with a hardware-software independent perspective (open-source, accessible, affordable). Cornerstone and capstone projects as well as a set of workshops represent the demonstrators of these activities. All these demonstrators are knitted together in a single path in which an educational attempt to fill the identified Construction 4.0 gaps is proposed. The STEAM perspective provides completeness to the whole development. During the last two years, the project was developed and the design, the development and implementation of several demonstrators were completed. In the years to come, a systematic deployment and analysis of such demonstrators is expected when a full implementation of the new degree of Technologies in Civil Engineering will be addressed.

AB  - In this paper we present an approach of multimodal data complex representation and processing based on the mathematical abstractions, such as aggregates and multi-images, as well as operations and relations between these mathematical objects, which are defined in the Algebraic System of Aggregates. This approach can be employed for online laboratories and immersive environments development for complex representation and processing of multimodal data which describe an object (process, phenomenon) of study. Such complex representation is resulted in obtaining a Digital Twin of the object of study that enables effective solving such tasks as modelling, prediction, classification, etc. In the paper we also propose the general architecture of an online laboratory and an immersive environment based on the presented mathematical background. A possible approach to software development for multimodal data processing is discussed in the paper as well.

AB  - Since the announcement of Industry 4.0 in 2012, multiple variants of this industry paradigm have emerged and built on the common platform of Internet of Things. Traditional engineering driven industries such as aerospace and automotive are able to align with Industry 4.0 and operate on requirements of the Internet of Things platform. Process driven industries such as water treatment and food processing are more influenced by societal perspectives and evolve into Water 4.0 or Dairy 4.0. In essence, the main outcomes of these X4.0 (where X can be any one of Quality, Water or a combination of) paradigms are facilitating communications between socio-technical systems and accumulating large amount of data. As the X4.0 paradigms are researched, defined, developed and applied, many real examples in industries have demonstrated the lack of system of systems design consideration, e.g. the issue of training together with the use of digital twin to simulate operation scenarios and faults in maintenance may lag behind events triggered in the hostile real world environment. This paper examines, from a high level system of systems perspective, how transdisciplinary engineering can incorporate data quality on the often neglected system elements of people and process while adapting applications to operate within the X4.0 paradigms.

AB  - The increasing labor shortage issue and the working safety awareness cause the urgent of the development of new construction methods. A new type of lab for new construction processes is required to expedite the innovation cycle. This paper presents an ongoing work of building a construction lab at University of Alberta. The goal of the construction lab is to provide a sandbox for developing new construction processes and machines. We designed the lab with four major systems: (1) sensors: to collect data from construction site for operation assistants and virtual reconstruction; (2) manipulators: to excavate the path planning algorithms and to develop the cooperation approaches between human and machines; (3) visualizers: to construct the digital twin of a real construction site for revealing the simulated results in virtual environment; (4) computers: to run machine learning algorithms for recognizing and tracking objects in construction environments. This laboratory allows the researchers in the construction engineering test and develop their tools in a controlled environment. Such scaled tests in the lab can bring significant benefits in finance, efficiency, and safety.Technical Area: Robotics, automation, and control.Application Context: Project design, construction, planning, and management.

T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of prognostics and health management solutions in the manufacturing industry has lagged behind academic advances due to a number of practical challenges. This work proposes a framework for the initial development of industrial PHM solutions that is based on the system development life cycle commonly used for software-based applications. Methodologies for completing the planning and design stages, which are critical for industrial solutions, are presented. Two challenges that are inherent to health modeling in manufacturing environments, data quality and modeling systems that experience trend-based degradation, are then identified and methods to overcome them are proposed. Additionally included is a case study documenting the development of an industrial PHM solution for a hyper compressor at a manufacturing facility operated by The Dow Chemical Company. This case study demonstrates the value of the proposed development process and provides guidelines for utilizing it in other applications.

TI  - Toward an IoT Framework for the New Generation of XR Applications
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, industry and academia have grown interested in Extended Reality (XR) and the development of creative and immersive applications that take advantage of it. This interest has led to new forms of interaction and immersion being considered for this type of application. However, many of these applications are still tied to traditional input devices, such as a mouse, touchscreen, or game controller, and output to mundane output devices, such as screens or projectors. With the democratization of affordable Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, there is an opportunity to integrate these devices into the next generation of creative applications. However, such integrations may be costly or involve much custom work to develop. This work aims to bridge this gap and create a framework that can be used by developers of such applications to leverage IoT devices for the creation of digital twins or as input and output devices for their applications, opening up software development to a whole new world of possibilities. Throughout this research work, a framework to enable the integration of any IoT device into the next generation of XR applications was proposed, as well as a detailed proposal of a pairing scheme for IoT devices that allows them to be matched with confidence to clients automatically.

TI  - DRESIA: Deep Reinforcement Learning-Enabled Gray Box Approach for Large-Scale Dynamic Cyber-Twin System Simulation
T2  - IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMPUTER SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The massive data generated by large-scale dynamic systems makes its optimization facing a tough challenge. Traditional White Box-based methods directly model the internal operating mechanism of the system, so massive amounts of measured data need to be handled, which is costly and time-consuming. The poor interpretability of the Black Box-based methods makes it difficult to adapt to the dynamic environment. Thus we propose a novel Gray Box-based approach namely Deep Reinforcement Learning-enabled Constraint Set Inversion Algorithm (DRESIA), which establishes a quantitative model of the nonlinear interoperability effects of system internal states which simplifies the White Box's complex mechanism of reconstruction and prediction and retains the interpretability of the model, therefore improves the prediction efficiency of feasible region while also improving the generalization ability. It further improves the dynamic adaptability of the modeling environment, which provides a new performance balancing scheme for system modeling. Under the premise that the large-scale 5G Cyber-Twin system satisfies the given Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, we perform DRESIA to realize the efficient and dynamic optimal search of feasible region, the results show that the DRESIA reduces the computational cost, and balances the accuracy and robustness of the feasible region, which validate the effectiveness and superiority of Gray Box-based approach.

T2  - DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES IN INFORMATION SCIENCES VII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Disruptive Technologies in Information Sciences VII
CL  - Orlando, FL
AB  - A United States Department of Defense Metaverse could provide significant benefit to advance the missions of the military services, but there are significant challenges to realizing its full potential. The DoD Metaverse could quickly up-skill warfighters, allow for the integration of technologies and services across the DoD, enable unprecedented command and control capabilities, inform new design and deployment decisions for technologies coming out of the research laboratories and serve as a training tool to equip warfighters for real world scenarios. Digital prototyping could improve the adoption capacity of impactful disruptive technologies and help propel their transition path to the physicalworld. For these benefits to be fully realized, however, key obstacles to wide scale adopt ion need to be addressed. The DoD needs interoperable and secure architectures to be able to share investment into the development of these synthetic environments. Siloed networks, slow acquisition pipelines, and a lack of understanding are preventing the DoD from adopting the very tools that will help improve its adoption capacity of other critical technologies. As we learn to overcome these challenges, we will need to address the legal, moral, ethical, and security considerations of having service members immersed into these virtual worlds. This paper will help the reader better understand metaverse technologies and their fundamental concepts. It will highlight essential components, outstanding required functionality, and specific opportunities for early adoption.

TI  - A review of distributed energy system optimization for building decarbonization
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
M3  - Review
AB  - Building energy consumption has increased rapidly in the past decade, in particular for heat demand and electric vehicles, owning to the development of economy and improvement of living standard. Distributed Energy Systems (DESs), which can effectively improve the share of renewable energy in the energy mix, lower the energy cost and reduce environmental impact, is a promising approach to meet the increased energy demand. This paper presents a review of the system architecture of DESs for building decarbonization, including hybrid energy systems, en-ergy storage technologies, building flexible loads, and electric vehicles. The uncertainties from both the environment and human interventions challenge the energy management due to the asynchrony between energy generation and energy consumption. Thus, the system should be optimally designed and operated to enhance the reliability, affordability, and flexibility of the DES. The paper highlights the adoption of optimization approaches. Finally, future trends and challenges are discussed. It is concluded that the digital transformation featured with IoT, AI, advanced machine learning, sophisticated optimization approaches, and Blockchain is the enabler for future smart cities.

TI  - Multi-domain system level modeling approach for assessment of degradation behaviour under thermal and thermo-mechanical stress
T2  - MICROELECTRONICS RELIABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the scope of this work, a multi-domain system modeling approach that is compatible with various electronical components and subsystems used in automotive and railway applications is to be developed. This approach serves the development of a hybrid, model-based condition monitoring of complex electronic and mechatronic systems. It aims at the implementation of condition monitoring in relevant applications of auto-motive and railway technology, e.g., safety-relevant electronic systems for train control and control units of electrified automobiles. Furthermore, the multi-physics modeling of the mentioned electronic components is performed using different object-oriented simulation environments, such as Simulink and OpenModelica1 in order to obtain as much information as possible that is relevant for the reliability assessment of the modeled systems. The approach is applied on two common example circuits used in complex electronic systems, a clocking circuit with a crystal oscillator and a full-wave bridge rectifier circuit. Moreover, the investigated circuits as well as the degradation behaviour under external loads during the operational lifetime in order to model the func-tionality are demonstrated.

TI  - Security of Digital Twins in Manufacturing
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Increasing productivity in manufacturing is a critical economic goal of the UK government and digitisation has been proposed as the cornerstone of achieving that. The MadeSmarter review makes a case for widespread digitisation across sectors (including manufacturing) and indicates the economic benefits that would accrue to the UK in doing so. It also draws significant attention to the role to be played by so-called Digital Twins.   Gartner has defined a digital twin as "a software design pattern that represents a physical object with the objective of understanding the asset's state, responding to changes, improving business operations and adding value" and describing a DT as "a digital representation of a real-world entity or system." The implementation of a digital twin is an encapsulated software object or model that mirrors a unique physical object, process, organization, person or other abstraction." For advanced manufacturing a DT has been described by the AMRC as "a live digital coupling of the state of a physical asset or process to a virtual representation with a functional output." Functional output here means information sent to a system or human observer that is actionable to deliver value.   There are many views on the precise nature of Twins Twins. Loosely speaking, there is a physical system or sensors, actuators and other assets or entities of which a "digital mirror" is maintained. Essentially, this is some digital model of important aspects of the system. The AMRC definition draws attention to the real-time ("live") nature of Digital Twins in manufacturing. This digital model can serve many purposes, from acting as the vehicle for remote interaction with the system by its operators (and remote operation has acquired a new importance in the light of the need to develop resilience to pandemics) to being the prmiary reference model over which intrusions are detected. Digital Twins have been identified by Gartner as one of the major technologies of our time.   Since Digital Twins are perceived as fundamental to value generation by systems so it is no surprise that their security has arisen as a problem. They may encapsulate important IPR and provide the most up to reference for the system's state. That information itself may be confidential and its integrity is critical to the effectiveness of a system to deliver ts business goals.   Understanding of the security of Digital Twins is limited. There has hardly been any reseach in this area. In this proposal we advance a wide-ranging initial programme of work that will engage stakeholders and lead eventually to a comprehensive understanding of security priorities concerning Digital Twins. Our programme mixes concrete research with engagement and roadmapping. It fuses the use of formal mathematic approaches to specification of systems and proofs of their properties, through to exploiting machine learning to detect intrusions. Our proposal also brings to bear expertise in manufacturing, robtics and control engineering. It is significantly interdisciplinary.   At its conclusion we will have a community aware of the risks of Digital Twins and with a fully informed sense of priorities for research and innovation. We will initiate new areas of research but also seek to understand the potential for cross-pollination and transfer of research insights from other domains.

AB  - To enhance quality and productivity as well as reduce trial and error in directed energy deposition (DED) processes, data analytics are essential. Collecting different signals like melt pool images, melt pool temperatures, environment conditions, and robot data during production, enables insights into the process. In general, the collected data can be either used during the process for in-situ monitoring or for post-process analytics anytime after the print job. Hence, in order to generate a digital twin of the process, the software architecture has to cover both cases, real-time data processing as well as data storage and access for post-process analysis. For this purpose, a software architecture consisting of four different layers, namely the physical-, distribution-, storage- and application layer was developed. The physical layer takes care of the sensor integration in the process and the real-time connection between the sensors and the data collection device. This device hosts at the same time the developed in-situ monitoring software ("DED Process Monitor"). The distribution layer is the connection layer between the physical- and storage layers by organizing the data transfer between the sensors and the database used by potential applications. The storage layer is embodied by a time-series database. A web- based software tool ("DED Process Analyzer"), representing the application layer, makes the database accessible for multiple users on different devices e.g. computers, notebooks, tablets, and smartphones. Through this architecture, a robot-based directed energy deposition process was digitalized including in-situ monitoring as well as postprocess data analytics. The DED Process Monitor is useable for the operator through a human-machine interface at the robot cell to observe the current production. This supports him in reacting to process deviations by adjusting process parameters or early stopping the process. In contrast to the DED Process Monitor, the DED Process Analyzer is realized through a decentralized web-based software tool. Therefore, the tool is useable for every employee with a suitable device connected to the internal network. Thereby multiple data engineers can use the collected data simultaneously for their analysis. Hereby different data analytic options are available. The scope starts from simple 2D data visualizations and ends up in post-process robot path simulations as well as complex 3D-Geomapping of sensor data. Through the 3D-Geomapping process sensor values are considered together with robot position data. This increases the extractable information content enormously. This method allows a geometrical representation of the sensor data over the contour of the printed part. By mapping sensor data to specific positions given by the robot, the sensor values are mapped to geometrical areas in the printed part. Thereby critical areas in the part can be identified. Using this information, later quality tests can focus on these areas instead of the total part. This saves time and costs. Furthermore, the DED Process Analyzer can be used to easily perform data preprocessing tasks like filtering and cleaning to create data sets which can then be used to train machine learning models.

TI  - An enhanced framework for next-generation operational buildings energy performance certificates
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The improvement of the energy performance of buildings is identified as one of the core challenges toward achieving a carbon-neutral built environment. In the 2018 recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, the European Commission has emphasized the need for improved schemes, to ensure the best possible evaluation of the actual energy performance of buildings, taking into consideration all the parameters related both to their construction and operation. Significant research efforts have been designated in this area, to identifying the additional information required to not only improve the energy performance certification process but also to provide more thorough reports to end-users. To increase comprehension, awareness, and thus genuine involvement, cutting-edge digital technologies are expected to be used. The research project entitled "Next-generation Dynamic Digital EPCs for Enhanced Quality and User Awareness" (D<^>2EPC GA 892984) introduces a comprehensive approach to next-generation Energy Performance Certificates that addresses the main challenges and gaps in buildings' energy assessment process, by introducing additional layers of information for the assessor and the user. A non-exhaustive list of the novel set of Energy Performance Certificates indicators, proposed in D<^>2EPC includes energy, smart readiness, wellbeing, comfort, financial, and sustainability related indicators. In this study, aspects of employing advanced digital solutions, like Building Information Modelling and Geographical Information Systems for the certification process are also demonstrated, through a well structured, high-level, detailed representation of the next-generation Energy Performance Certificates system architecture. This framework elaborates on individual components and their interaction, toward delivering the envisioned final enriched cloud-based platform, that will enable dynamic Energy Performance Certificates based on (near) real-time field data. This study aspires to initiate the discussion within the scientific community of buildings' energy assessment on the required practices for digitizing and enriching the certification process of buildings, in compliance with Industry 4.0 practices.

AB  - This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated engineers and technicians in production engineering.  It will do so by supporting two, two-day workshops on production engineering education by the University of Tennessee Chattanooga and Tennessee Technological University.   The overall goal of the workshops is to recommend educational approaches for the rapidly expanding production technology of digital twin research and development.  A digital twin is a virtual model of a process, product, or service. This pairing of virtual and physical worlds enables analysis and improvement of systems, including production engineering systems.  For example, by developing new efficiencies first in the digital twin, and then testing them in the physical twin, processes and products can be improved.  It is expected that these workshops will contribute to achieving scalable, reliable, and cost-effective strategies for creation of digital twins that accurately represent complex systems, such as manufacturing and chemical plants, airplanes, and wind turbines.

TI  - Collaborative Research: Software Engineering Workforce Development in High Performance Computing for Digital Twins
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated engineers and technicians in production engineering.  It will do so by supporting two, two-day workshops on production engineering education by the University of Tennessee Chattanooga and Tennessee Technological University.   The overall goal of the workshops is to recommend educational approaches for the rapidly expanding production technology of digital twin research and development.  A digital twin is a virtual model of a process, product, or service. This pairing of virtual and physical worlds enables analysis and improvement of systems, including production engineering systems.  For example, by developing new efficiencies first in the digital twin, and then testing them in the physical twin, processes and products can be improved.  It is expected that these workshops will contribute to achieving scalable, reliable, and cost-effective strategies for creation of digital twins that accurately represent complex systems, such as manufacturing and chemical plants, airplanes, and wind turbines.  The workshops will also contribute to developing  guidelines for training the STEM workforce needed to develop and implement digital twins in production engineering and other applications.  The first workshop will be held at the University of Tennessee Chattanooga and will result in a report describing the intellectual contributions of multiple disciplines to the use of digital twins in production engineering.

TI  - Zero-touch networks: Towards next-generation network automation
T2  - COMPUTER NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Zero-touch network and Service Management (ZSM) framework represents an emerging paradigm in the management of the fifth-generation (5G) and Beyond (5G+) networks, offering automated self -management and self-healing capabilities to address the escalating complexity and the growing data volume of modern networks. ZSM frameworks leverage advanced technologies such as Machine Learning (ML) to enable intelligent decisionmaking and reduce human intervention. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the applications of the ZSM framework, covering network optimization, traffic monitoring, energy efficiency, and security aspects of next -generation networks. The paper explores the challenges associated with ZSM, particularly those related to ML, which necessitate the need to explore diverse network automation solutions. In this context, the study investigates the application of Automated ML (AutoML) within a ZSM framework, to reduce network management costs and enhance performance. AutoML automates the selection and tuning process of a ML model for a given task. Specifically, the focus is on AutoML's ability to predict application throughput and autonomously adapt to data drift. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AutoML pipeline over traditional ML in terms of prediction accuracy. Integrating AutoML and ZSM concepts significantly reduces network configuration and management efforts, allowing operators to allocate more time and resources to other important tasks. The paper also provides a high-level 5G system architecture incorporating AutoML and ZSM concepts. This research highlights the potential of ZSM and AutoML to revolutionize the management of 5G+ networks, enabling automated decision-making and empowering network operators to achieve higher efficiency, improved performance, and enhanced user experience.

TI  - Exascale Computing for System-Level Engineering: Design, Optimisation and Resilience
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - The arrival of exascale computers will open new frontiers in our ability to simulate highly complex engineered and natural systems. This will create new opportunities for the design and optimisation of new, highly integrated engineered systems for the future. It will also allow the development of 'digital twins' of complex natural systems, such has the human body and coastal/river regions, that will allow is to explore and manage engineering-led interventions in personalised healthcare and management of the natural environment.  The exascale computers of the future will be highly parallel with hundreds of thousands, or millions of processes, working collectively. Exploiting this remarkable level of parallelism will require dramatic advances in the mathematics, numerical methods, software engineering and software tools that underpin simulation, and will depend on experts in each of these areas coming together. The simulation of the different but tightly coupled physical processes that characterises complex engineered and natural systems poses additional challenges of coordinating the simulation of multiple processes, such as the noise created by an airflow flow around a moving structure under the influence of a magnetic field, or the fluid, solid, electrical and chemical interactions a human body.   This project brings together of working group of experts from computer science, mathematics and engineering to address the challenge of how to simulate coupled physical process at a system level on future exascale systems. It will also address how to integrate into the simulation process the vast quantity of data that can be collected from real systems, how to assess uncertainties and how to interpret the vast quantities of data that exascale simulations will generate. The working group will formulate roadmaps for enabling research for exascale computing, and support research software engineer training for exascale-ready software skills.

TI  - Advancing Probabilistic Machine Learning to Deliver Safer, More Efficient, and Predictable Air Traffic Control
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - The ambition of this partnership between NATS and The Alan Turing Institute is to develop the fundamental science to deliver the world's first AI system to control a section of airspace in live trials.  Our research will take a hierarchical approach to air traffic control (ATC) by developing a digital twin alongside a multi-agent machine-learning control system for UK airspace. Furthermore, the partnership will develop technical approaches to deploy trustworthy AI systems, considering how safety, explainability and ethics are embedded within our methods, so that we can deliver new tools which work in harmony with human air traffic controllers in a safety-critical environment.  Little has changed in the fundamental infrastructure of UK airspace in the past 50 years, but demand for aviation has increased a hundredfold. Aviation 2050, a recent government green paper, underlines the importance of the aviation network to the prosperity of the UK to the value of &pound;22 billion annually. Yet our nation is at risk without rapid action to modernise our airspace and control methods, to ensure they can handle a future increase in UK passenger traffic of over 50% by 2050 and new challenges arising from unmanned aircraft, both against a backdrop of increasing global pressures to transform the sector's environmental impact.   The augmentation of live air traffic control through the use of AI agents which can handle the complexity and uncertainties in the system has transformative potential for NATS's business. This will positively impact live operations, as well as a research tool and training facility for new ATCOs. Correspondingly, NATS's research vision is to exploit new approaches to AI that enable increases in safety, capacity and environmental sustainability while streamlining air traffic controller training.  The anticipated benefits of AI systems to air traffic control have come at a critical time, providing us with an opportunity to respond effectively to the unprecedented challenges which arise from a triad of crises: the coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, Brexit and global warming. The UK must develop independent technical advances in the sector, without compromising sustainability targets.  The Alan Turing Institute is positioned at the rapidly evolving frontiers of probabilistic machine learning, safe and trustworthy AI and reproducible software engineering. Matching this with the world-leading expertise of NATS, supported by a world-first data set of more than 20 million flight records, means that this partnership is in a unique position to build the first multi AI agents system to deliver tactical control of UK airspace.
