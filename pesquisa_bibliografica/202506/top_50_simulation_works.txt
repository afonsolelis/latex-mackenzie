ABSTRACT: Simulation environments are essential for the continuous development of complex cyberphysical systems such as self-driving cars (SDCs). Previous results on simulation-based testing for SDCs have shown that many automatically generated tests do not strongly contribute to the identification of SDC faults, hence do not contribute towards increasing the quality of SDCs. Because running such "uninformative " tests generally leads to a waste of computational resources and a drastic increase in the tes...

ABSTRACT: Simulation is an educational tool that is commonly used to teach processes that are infeasible to practice in the real world. Software process education is a domain that has not yet taken full advantage of the benefits of simulation. To address this, we have developed SimSE, an educational, interactive, graphical environment for building and simulating software engineering processes in a game-like setting. We detail the design of SimSE, present an initial simulation model of a waterfall process ...

ABSTRACT: The literature is rich in discussion of methods, platforms and standards that hope to ease the process of integrating models in workflows or decision support systems. The reality for practitioners is that integrating models is still complex and time consuming in most cases. In addition, the literature contains few descriptions of the practicalities of integrating models in the hydrology domain. This paper presents two case studies to explore opportunities for reducing the complexity associated w...

ABSTRACT: To enhance quality and productivity as well as reduce trial and error in directed energy deposition (DED) processes, data analytics are essential. Collecting different signals like melt pool images, melt pool temperatures, environment conditions, and robot data during production, enables insights into the process. In general, the collected data can be either used during the process for in-situ monitoring or for post-process analytics anytime after the print job. Hence, in order to generate a dig...

ABSTRACT: The design of bug-free and safe medical device software is challenging, especially in complex implantable devices. This is due to the device's closed-loop interaction with the patient's organs, which are stochastic physical environments. The life-critical nature and the lack of existing industry standards to enforce software validation make this an ideal domain for exploring design automation challenges for integrated functional and formal modeling with closed-loop analysis. The primary goal of ...

ABSTRACT: Simulators are crucial components in many software-intensive systems, such as cyber-physical systems and digital twins. The inherent complexity of such systems renders the manual construction of simulators an error-prone and costly endeavor, and automation techniques are much sought after. However, current automation techniques are typically tailored to a particular system and cannot be easily transposed to other settings. In this paper, we propose an approach for the automated construction of s...

ABSTRACT: One key objective of Cyber-Physical System (CPS) simulation is to evaluate different CPS configurations regarding a certain user objective. First, simulation of CPS necessitates frameworks to handle heterogeneity of CPS components (the software and hardware system control, the behavior of the CPS itself and its physical environment). Then, to build simulators, designers use paradigms like FMI (Functional Mock-Up Interface) that proposes a data-driven generic interface facilitating the integratio...
